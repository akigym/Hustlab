[{"content": "We are in war. We are all in shock. The case is not for less. Nobody, especially in the Western world, has experienced a situation like this. I have written here many times that we live in a global world. Now, in this global village that allows us to be quickly connected with Australia or Canada, which allows us to do business with any part of the globe, it also gives us back to us what this virus is like, whose propagation began in China. Yes, this is also globalization. We are facing an unprecedented crisis, as more recent epidemics have remained more geographically concentrated. The 2008 crisis, for example, was not nearly or even remotely similar to this one. It was mostly financial, and economic. We had social consequences, but without the public health problems that we are witnessing and that we will have to face. It is no coincidence that at Christmas the most common message is the wish for health. For this good, this gift, is, without a shadow of a doubt, the greatest thing we can have. Even to face the financial and economic crises. We are at a stage where circumstances and risks almost lead us to say: screw the economy, screw the alienated orthodoxy of certain decision-makers. Fuck it. I don&#39;t think there is any business that exceeds the value of human life. But we can&#39;t screw the economy. Today we have to take care of everyone and then restore the economy. Let&#39;s be clear. Nobody is in a position to face such a pandemic on their own. There are no resources. There are no ways. Portugal is no exception. And Portugal already had, before Covid-19, many problems in our National Health Service (SNS). We are not prepared, not even a little bit more or less to test the peak response of the NHS, the fans, the machines do not multiply, much less the health professionals, whose shoulders will carry weights that will test their limits, such as China and the Italy already showed us. However, not being prepared cannot mean sitting idly by, waiting for danger. We can not. For exceptional periods, responses must be exceptional. Yes, we need to be home. Yes, we need to understand that this is not for fun, for going to the beach or simply ignoring the gravity of the contagion problem. In society, the unconsciousness of some can, in a literal sense, endanger the lives of others, especially the most vulnerable. That&#39;s why we need strong leadership and authority. We cannot play at the rulers, it is not enough to pose as a statesman. We need people with the stamina and the pulse to make difficult, unpopular, but necessary decisions. We don&#39;t need politics. We cannot be held hostage to apparently technical opinions, because in these public health measures the technician becomes inseparable from the political. Italy is a dramatic example. It&#39;s there. To observe, learn and correct answers. And this is also a defining moment. Where is the European Union? What answer do you give? Years and years of European construction, bureaucratic institutions and when we have a global problem, it&#39;s everyone for themselves. This is what it feels like, very little cooperation and solidarity. And this will have economic and political consequences down the road. But in the future we all want to be alive. Alive also to assess the responses that our policy makers have given us, that time will come to take stock, to make assessments, but after the fire turns to ashes. Alive to rebuild a world that is all connected and that shows us that there is no one immune in a situation like this. Rich and poor, West and East. We are all in the same boat, humanity, like the planet we inhabit, is one. I think there is no greater fear than that of death or of seeing our people perish. And that must be our focus. Then, with health, with all the sick treated, we must rebuild a global economy. We still can&#39;t count the damage of two weeks at home, even more when we don&#39;t even know if it will only be 15 days or more. It will be dramatic for commerce, restaurants, hotels and other services. Yes. Unfortunately it will be. The tourism sector is in the throes of cancellations. Many factories will have to stop or run well below their capacity. But we urgently need to stop this animal so we can return to the terraces, restaurants, shopping centers and beaches. Without a vaccine, without an effective anti-virus in the elimination of COVID-19, we are left, as the epidemiologist Peter Piot (one of the researchers who discovered Ebola) called them, \u201cmedieval containment methods: isolation, quarantine and mapping of contacts\u201d. Screw the economy, people&#39;s safety comes first. It takes courage."}, {"content": "POLL-Chinese economy clobbered by coronavirus but set to recover soon. (Reuters) - The coronavirus-hit Chinese economy will grow at its slowest rate since the financial crisis in the current quarter, according to a Reuters poll of economists who said the downturn will be short-lived if the outbreak is contained.\nA Feb. 7-13 Reuters poll of 40 economists based in mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, as well as Europe and the United States, predicted China\u2019s annual economic growth in the first quarter of 2020 to slump to 4.5% from 6.0% in the previous quarter.\nThat drop was expected to drag down the full-year growth rate in 2020 to 5.5% from 6.1% in 2019, its weakest since at least 1990 when comparable records began.\nHowever, economists were optimistic the economy would bounce back as soon as the second quarter, with growth then forecast to recover to a median 5.7%, according to the poll.\nThat figure was pushed higher by several optimistic forecasts from economists based in mainland China. The range was 2.9%-6.5%.\nThe coronavirus was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan - a nerve center in the global supply chain with a population of just under 11 million - and so far has claimed over 1,300 lives in China. That outstrips fatalities from the SARS outbreak in 2002-03 which killed 774 people worldwide.\n\u201cNobody knows the damage China\u2019s virus containment efforts will have on growth, and we probably never will for sure, given the opacity of the statistics. We reckon true GDP growth will fall below 2% in Q1, from 4.0% in Q4, which already was substantially lower than the official 6.0%,\u201d said Freya Beamish, chief Asia economist at Pantheon in London.\n\u201cThe lost production probably will be made up over the remainder of this year. But some service sector activity simply will be lost... people aren\u2019t going to get their hair cut twice because they missed getting it cut in Q1, or buy two coffees to make up for missed consumption.\u201d\n(Reuters poll graphic on coronavirus impact on the Chinese economy - here)\nThe enforced shutdown started during the Lunar New Year - usually the busiest time for most services businesses and according to most economists will accelerate an already-noticeable downturn before the outbreak.\nWhen asked to comment on what would happen to the economy if Chinese authorities failed to contain the virus from spreading rapidly, some mainland economists were reluctant to respond.\nGrowth was expected to slow to 3.5% in the first quarter in a worst-case scenario, according to a median from 15 economists in response to a separate question, with forecasts ranging between zero and 5.5%.\n\u201cI think the virus will be under control by April. However, in the worst-case scenario, growth may fall to 2-3% in the first quarter and to 5% in (full-year) 2020,\u201d said Bingnan Ye, senior macroeconomic analyst at Bank of China International in Beijing.\nTheir 2020 forecast matched the median worst-case outcome and lined up with the Chinese government\u2019s forecast for the full-year economic growth rate to fall as much as 1 percentage point in 2020.\n\u201cWe do not expect a speedy recovery for the economy, even in the unlikely event that there are no new confirmed cases. After the coronavirus has been contained, it may still take four quarters to see a full recovery,\u201d said Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING in Hong Kong.\n\u201cCompared to 2003\u2019s SARS, this is a lot more damaging.\u201d\nSince then, China\u2019s economic composition has changed significantly to become a more consumption and service-driven economy from being the world\u2019s factory before.\nChina\u2019s share of the global economy has quadrupled to 16% since the SARS outbreak, so any major disruption to economic activity is likely to have a bigger impact on the world economy now.\n\u201cEvery day is a deadline in February as Wuhan coronavirus data roll in,\u201d noted Lee Hardman, currency strategist at MUFG, the most accurate forecaster for Asian currencies in 2019. \u201cFor the yuan, the overall depreciation story continues.\u201d\n(Reuters poll graphic on China economic outlook - here)"}, {"content": "Coronavirus. The world&#39;s largest telecommunications fair will take place despite cancellations. The organizers of the world&#39;s largest mobile telecommunications fair, which takes place in Barcelona (Spain), decided to keep holding the event at the end of February, despite the wave of cancellations linked to fear of the coronavirus. The Spanish press reports that this decision was taken at an extraordinary meeting held by the general council of the organizing association (GSMA) of the Mobile World Congress (MWC) which is being held in the capital of the autonomous community of Catalonia. The meeting, initially planned to take place on Friday, was brought forward to 14:00 local time (13:00 in Lisbon). The congress is scheduled to start on February 24th, running until the 27th, and its realization is being analyzed after several technology companies have given up participating, due to fears of propagation of the new coronavirus. Finnish technology company Nokia announced today that it would not participate in the congress in Barcelona for fear of the spread of the coronavirus, being the latest in the growing list of dropouts at the event, which includes the major providers of mobile telecommunications equipment. The outbreak of the new coronavirus that was detected in China has infected more than 45,000 people and caused the death of more than 1,100, but only one of the deaths occurred outside Chinese territory. The World Health Organization (WHO) on Tuesday assigned the name Covid-19 to the disease caused by the new coronavirus."}, {"content": "Death toll rose to 636, with more than 31,000 confirmed cases. The death toll from the new coronavirus rose this Friday to 636, with 31,161 people infected, Chinese authorities announced today. Since the last assessment, on Thursday, there have been 73 more deaths and 3,143 cases of infection in the outbreak that started in the city of Wuhan, in the central province of Hubei. Of the cases of infection, 4,821 are considered serious, while 1,540 people who were ill have already been discharged, indicated the Chinese National Health Commission. Authorities followed more than 314,000 patients, 186,000 of whom remain under observation. In Europe, the number of confirmed cases has reached 31 today, with new infections detected in the UK, Germany and Italy. The Chinese doctor who issued the first warning about the outbreak of the new coronavirus died on Thursday after contracting pneumonia last week, announced the hospital where he was admitted. Ophthalmologist Li Wenliang, 34, was &quot;unfortunately infected while fighting the pneumonia epidemic of the new coronavirus,&quot; Wuhan Central Hospital said in his Facebook social network account. The first person to die from the new coronavirus outside China was a Chinese citizen in the Philippines. In addition to mainland China and the Chinese regions of Macau and Hong Kong, there are other confirmed cases of infection in more than 20 countries. On January 30, the World Health Organization declared an international public health emergency, which presupposes the adoption of prevention and coordination measures on a global scale."}, {"content": "Combatting corona: Why govt needs your help to contain virus. Over 6,000 people have died globally since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. More than 1,62,000 have been infected by Covid-19. What started in China, soon spread across France, the US, Spain, Italy, South Korea and now India.\nIndia, so far, has officially reported 110 cases and two deaths, according to the Ministry of Health. More cases are emerging every day even as states continue to issue advisories on social distancing.\nThe government has put in place stringent measures to curb the spread of the virus. A mandatory quarantine of 14 days has been initiated for all international travellers arriving in the country.\nFrom thermal screenings at major entry-exit points to sanitisation of public places, the Indian government has put its best foot forward in battling the pandemic which has led to significant panic among Indians.\nSelf-discipline is the best cure\nHowever, more than scrutinising the steps taken by the government, the utmost requirement at the moment is self-discipline.\nWith the threat of the rapidly spreading virus looming large over India due to its billion-plus population, it is important to understand the depravity that could be if the spread is not limited in the initial days.\nItaly is the best example to map how rapidly the virus can spread and why it is absolutely essential to impose self-restrictions at an early stage, and not wait for the disaster to strike.\nThe country recorded 368 more deaths from the coronavirus outbreak on Sunday, its biggest single-day rise, amid growing concern about the ability of its strained health system to cope with the relentless increase in new cases. With 24,747 cases and 1,809 deaths by Sunday - a rise of 368 or 25 per cent in the death toll in just 24 hours - Italy's experience has offered an alarming example for other European countries. And, Indians should take note.\nThe daily rise in cases around the globe, especially in countries like Italy -- with a small population of 60 million people -- is alarming. If the virus spreads with such aggressiveness in India, it could result in severe consequences even after the virus fades away.\nIn Italy, hospitals are also unable to cope with such high-frequency rise on a daily basis. Roberta Re, a nurse at Piacenza hospital in Emilia-Romagna called the situation 'war-like', as reported by The Guardian.\n\"It's an experience I would compare to a world war, but it's a war that isn't fightable with traditional arms - as we don't yet know who the enemy is and so it's difficult to fight. The only weapon we do have to avoid things getting even worse is to stay at home and to respect the rules, to do what they did in China, as this is paying off,\" she said.\nPrecaution, not panic\nWith an abundance of global examples that show the severe spread of Covid-19, it can be deduced that most infections spread through lack of individual restrictions at an initial stage. And as the situation aggravated with rising cases in a country or one particular area, the excessive panic was witnessed.\nThis panic, if substituted by precautions at early stages, could help India avoid the health crisis of a much larger magnitude. However, the government alone would not be able to help limit the virus; all citizens must also act responsibly and take the outbreak seriously.\nSocial media chatter over the past few months since the outbreak has often misled people, as some took it lightly and others panicked to insanity. However, doctors advised none of the above. Instead, they asked people to be prepared with some basic but necessary precautions. Social distancing, however, is the most important one.\nThree ways that you can help\n1) Doctors have asked people to stay home if they absolutely do not have to go out.\n2) Medical experts have also asked people to avoid any kind of large gatherings.\n3) Take care of hygiene, wash your hands for at least 20 seconds and avoid touching your face\nThese are a few simple steps you can take to support the government in limiting the spread of Covid-19. While not much is known about this virus, doctors, have asked people to follow these important steps at the moment to delay the spread of the virus. But even if you test positive, there is no need to suppress your travel history or run away.\nThe quarantine process is not only for the recovery of an infected person but it is also for the safety of other people in the country. Going by the rate of spread in Italy, Iran, and China, any person with symptoms coming in contact with other people could prove deadly as the virus would keep multiplying. Even if it does not affect an individual carrying it, doctors have clearly mentioned that its spread could be fatal for older people with a weak immune system.\nFor instance, one of the first cases in Uttar Pradesh's Noida which led to an initial shut down of two schools and a five-star hotel, was from a man who returned from Italy and kept his travel history suppressed. He then kept on with his usual social life, exposing others to the danger.\nThere are many other reports in India about suspected people running away in fear that they would be kept in isolation in the quarantine facility. But people have to realise that the process will help in containing the spread of the virus to a great extent.\nIndia is still in the initial stages with 110 official confirmed cases, and so far, it has managed to keep the death toll much lower than the other countries in the third week of the outbreak. And, by imposing self-restrictions, individuals can help the government in flattening the curve further.\nPeople on social media, especially, the young batch who are yet to grasp the seriousness of the issue, need to be more self vigilant. The basics include - doctor visit for 'flu-like symptoms', avoiding crowded places and social gathering until absolutely necessary, restricting movement, opting for work-from-home. It is important to realise that every country initially had a mere number of cases, but within days it rose massively.\nDesperate times call for desperate measures, and at this hour, more than scrutinising the steps taken by the government, it is imperative to focus on personal hygiene and self-discipline."}, {"content": "Fake news alert: Coronavirus will not invade your body within 10 minutes if you do not quench your thirst.

TOURISM: China is more of a small market for German tour operators. The German Travel Association pointed out that around 600,000 to 650,000 people from Germany travel to China every year. Around two thirds of them are business travelers. For tourism in Germany, guests from China are of greater importance.

At the company&#39;s headquarters in Stockdorf, south-west of Munich, the 1,000 colleagues who work there are free to work at home. It had previously become known that an employee in Stockdorf had been infected with the new corona virus by a Chinese colleague from Shanghai.

According to Chinese media reports, the doctor who first reported the coronavirus to the authorities on December 30th died as a result of the lung disease. Li Wenliang, 34, worked at the Wuhan Central Hospital and was the first to draw attention to the novel virus. He and seven other participants from a medical group were initially summoned and warned by the police after their warning and had to sign that they would not reveal anything more about the outbreak. He fell ill himself on January 10th. The coronavirus was only diagnosed on January 30th. Most of those who died as a result of the virus are older than 60 years, and many even over 80 years old. Why the 34-year-old doctor died and whether there were any complications is not yet known. The Chinese party newspaper Global Times had confirmed the doctor&#39;s death. State television also reported the death of Li Wenliang. The 34-year-old leaves behind a young family: his wife is currently pregnant with the second child. There was also another infection in Germany. The wife of an infected person was also infected with the corona virus. This means that the total number of virus detections has risen to 13 - eleven in connection with the Bavarian company Webasto and two for returnees from China. The latest virus detection comes from the 38-year-old woman of one of the patients from Bavaria, as the Bavarian Ministry of Health announced. In the past few days it had already become known that two of the couple&#39;s children were also infected. In the couple&#39;s third child, an infant, the virus has not yet been detected, said the medical director of the clinics of S\u00fcdostbayern AG, Stefan Paech. The whole family is in quarantine at the Trostberger Klinikum of S\u00fcdostbayern AG. It was reported that she wanted to stay together at her own request. &quot;We assumed from the outset that the family as a whole was already infected,&quot; said Paech. This is now confirmed by the findings that were received piece by piece. The fact that the mother has only now tested positive is due to the fact that the reaction time is different. It was decided to leave the baby with the family, especially since the course is very mild at this age, said Paech. There was a weighing up: &quot;Separation of children versus the possible risk of a mild clinical course. We made this decision in consultation with the paediatricians, and it has been confirmed that this was the right approach.&quot; The family is doing well under the circumstances, although the quarantine situation is stressful. The couple&#39;s two older children had only mild symptoms, according to Paech. The father&#39;s health is stable. He is being treated with antiviral drugs. So far, all corona cases in Bavaria are related to Webasto. There, an employee of a Chinese colleague was infected, who shortly after flew back to China. The German corona patient on the Spanish island of La Gomera also had contact with a Webasto employee, as the State Office for Health and Food Safety (LGL) announced. In addition to the eleven cases in Bavaria, there are two more people across Germany in whom the virus has been detected. Both had been tested after being brought to Germany from China last weekend along with more than 120 other travelers. Meanwhile, a survey by the polling institute Infratest dimap showed that nine out of ten Germans are not afraid of the virus. 89 percent said they were not afraid that they or family members could get infected. For seven percent of the respondents, however, the fear was &quot;great&quot; and for three percent &quot;very great&quot;. Most of the respondents also showed great confidence in the local authorities and health facilities: four out of five respondents were of the opinion that they had the situation under control. On the other hand, 14 percent said they believed the institutions were not in control of the situation."}, {"content": "Drugmakers see long road ahead in coronavirus vaccine race. NEW YORK: Drug manufacturers\u00a0racing to find a vaccine or effective treatment for the deadly new coronavirus in China cautioned that they have a long way to go. \n That runs counter to reports of a supposed \"breakthrough\" that on Wednesday (Feb 5) boosted financial markets and spurred optimism not necessarily backed by reality. \n At least a dozen drugmakers are working on vaccines or antivirals and other treatments to help those infected with the fast-spreading contagion. \n Investment costs for vaccines could run as high as US$800 million in a process that, even if accelerated, will likely take more than a year until approval, according to executives from companies involved in the effort. \n  \n \"It will take at least 12 to 18 months, which means in the acute situation we are in now - at least in China - that will not create a benefit,\" said Thomas Breuer, chief medical officer of GlaxoSmithKline's vaccine unit. GSK is working with developers by providing a technology that could make their vaccines more potent. \n The virus, which emerged in December in China, has killed nearly 500 people and shows no sign of abating, with thousands of new cases reported each day, mostly in central China's Hubei province. But its spread to some 27 countries and regions has caused global alarm. \n To be sure, companies developing treatments for patients who are already sick may be able to get a drug approved faster than a vaccine that would be given to healthy people. Even so, logistical and regulatory challenges remain, according to two executives at Gilead Sciences Inc, which is working on an experimental antiviral treatment. \n \"There is a distinction there between a therapeutic and a vaccine. Having said that, I think it is true that this won't be super fast and it will involve us investing at risk right now,\" said Gilead Chief Medical Officer Merdad Parsey. \n Clinical trials for treatments can be smaller and of shorter duration than for vaccines, Parsey acknowledged. \n Challenges in making sure therapies are effective and then scaling up production still remain. Gilead has only a limited supply of its remdesivir, which will be tested against the coronavirus after previously failing in trials as a treatment for Ebola. \n 'LOOKING FOR A MAGIC BULLET' \n Dr\u00a0Thomas Frieden, who was director of the US\u00a0Centres for Disease Control and Prevention during the also deadly MERS outbreak, said the benefit of antiviral treatments for such emergencies in the past has been modest. \n What worked with MERS and SARS, for example, was better infection control in healthcare facilities, he said of two other types of coronaviruses that also caused global alarm. \n \"It doesn't mean we shouldn't try, but we're often looking for a magic bullet and the bright shiny object. Sometimes we need to just have the basics,\" Frieden said. \n A Chinese TV report on Wednesday said that a research team at Zhejiang University had found an effective drug for the virus, while researchers in the UK told Sky News separately they had made a \"significant breakthrough\" in finding a vaccine. \n Reuters could not independently verify the reports, but several traders cited them for sharp upticks in global stock markets. \n \"There are no known effective therapeutics against this 2019-nCoV,\" said World Health Organisation spokesman Tarik Jasarevic, using the current designation for the new coronavirus, when asked about reports of \"drug breakthroughs.\" \n Health officials in the United States and China have set ambitious goals for getting a vaccine to initial human testing within the next few months. \n Newer vaccine platforms, such as one developed by Moderna Inc, allow scientists to create a potential vaccine in record time just based on knowing the genetic code of the novel coronavirus. With the genetic code in hand, scientists can start vaccine development without needing a sample of the virus. \n Anthony Fauci, director of the US\u00a0National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is using Moderna's platform, said the agency is on the fastest pace ever to develop a vaccine candidate. \n He hopes to have a vaccine available for initial safety testing within two and a half to three months from the time scientists determined the genetic sequence of the virus. \n Novavax Inc research chief Gregory Glenn told Reuters his company has taken vaccines from discovery to clinical testing in 90 days and believes it could do something similar for the new coronavirus. \n But to move vaccine candidates from the lab to widespread use in patients involves a number of hurdles, according to health experts and executives for drugmakers working on coronavirus vaccines and treatments. \n In addition to scaling up manufacturing capacity and building distribution networks, there are regulatory hurdles such as conducting large clinical trials to make sure a vaccine not only confers immunity to the virus but is safe for use in the general population. \n \"The earliest you could even know if it's going to work is a year,\" Fauci said. \n Whether even a highly effective vaccine will prove profitable for companies is another big question. \n \"The outbreak could be abating by the time a vaccine is deemed safe,\" Karen Andersen, who follows biotech companies for Morningstar, said in a research note. \n The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) has raised around US$800 million from donors to aid in preventing pandemic diseases and has allocated some of those funds to biotechs, including Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc, Moderna Inc and CureVac, which are working on coronavirus vaccines. \n \"We stepped into this with no economic expectation,\" said Paul Stoffels, Johnson & Johnson's chief scientific officer. \"We'll see whether in the end it gives a reward.\" \n Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"}, {"content": "Coronavirus: India Inc will shiver if China can't contain outbreak . Growing insecurity over the coronavirus (Covid-19) epidemic in China may have a sharp impact on India's already-strained economy as industries fear that the outbreak could cripple their production activities.\nA recent report by Ind-RA said efforts to contain the virus outbreak within next three to four months will be critical as it would determine the fate of many industries around the globe, including in India.\nIf the virus is contained within the aforesaid time period, the impact on businesses in India and elsewhere will not be overgenerous, the report said.\nBut if no positive result comes within a few months, multiple Indian sectors could face major supply-side disturbances, triggering a delay in key manufacturing activities.\nThe Ind-Ra report goes on to highlight that the economic impact could be worse than what was seen during the SARS outbreak in 2003. At that time, the world was less dependent on China, now considered the biggest world's biggest manufacturing hub with a substantial contribution to the global GDP.\nChina now contributes to over one-sixth or over 15 per cent of the world's GDP and any deceleration in manufacturing activity could significantly impact worldwide growth.\nCommenting on the situation, Sunil Damania, CIO, MarketsMojo.com, said, \"For some reason, if China is unable to control it for six months, the impacts would be severe.\"\n\"It's very difficult to quantify as there are many moving parts. But it would have a significant impact and has the potential to drag down the world's GDP growth rate by at least 20 basis points for CY2020,\" he added.\nIMPACT ON INDIA\nThe Indian economy is already battling many headwinds including inflation, slow demand, and lower-income, which resulted in a sharp fall in GDP growth in 2019. Economic woes could amplify as many of the country's key sectors rely heavily on components or parts manufactured in China.\nWhile the government predicted India's growth for the next fiscal at 6.5 per cent, delay in supply of key essential commodities from China for a prolonged period could spill water on that optimistic forecast.\nSome sectors such as automobiles, consumer electronics, drugs and pharmaceuticals -- all of which contribute significantly to the country's GDP -- will bear the brunt of the supply curbs. Interlinked sectors will also suffer as a result.\n\"If the outbreak continues for longer than anticipated then the risk will not be restricted to a few sectors, but it can hurt the overall economy,\" Damania said.\nOver the past few weeks, concerned voices from the industry have discussed the issue in detail.\nSome industry experts said trade has already been mildly affected in India as supply chain issues start cropping up. The impact will start showing when firms run out of inventory, they said.\nLOWER JOBS, INFLATION AND MORE\nA delay in the supply of inventory would not only lead to lower production but will also lower sales volume. It could also lead to job cuts and higher inflation.\nFor instance, many electronic goods and phone manufacturers have already started facing the effects of supply slowdown as companies in China failed to restart key manufacturing activities. Major smartphone sellers like Xiaomi hinted at possible rise in prices as supplies of key components are already facing delays.\nA host of Indian smartphone manufacturers, who dearly depend on China for key components, are already indicating that their productions will fall if the supply disruptions continue. It could be a huge blow to India, which is the second-largest smartphone market in the world.\nSome analysts are expecting a drop in production and sales of consumer durables and smartphones while others fear that prices could go up in a situation where there is high demand but lack of supply.\nConsumer durables like television, washing machines and air conditioners -- all of which need critical components manufactured in China -- may also see a drop in sales due to lack of supply.\nWhat's worse is the fact that it could lead to higher inflationary pressure on India as China vendors have hiked prices of critical components amid the shortage. Higher inflation in times of slow growth could be disastrous for India and could severely disrupt plans to revive the economy.\nLike smartphones, automobile manufacturers also import a host of parts and essential components from China. It may be noted that more than 60 per cent of Chinese auto assembly production units have been directly affected by the coronavirus epidemic.\nA Boston Consulting Group report said the impact on the Chinese automobile industry will affect many other countries including India. A Fitch report said India's auto production activity could dip by over 8 per cent in 2020 due to the situation.\n\"China supplies India with between 10-30 per cent of its automotive components and this could be two to three times higher when looking at India's EV segment, which highlights just how exposed India's automobile manufacturing industry is to the slowdown of vehicle Chinese component manufacturing,\" it said.\nBut manufacturers in India have little choice apart from monitoring the situation and hoping for factories in China to fire up their assembly lines. Some Chinese factories reopened this week, but workers are in no position to resume activities with no solution in sight.\nAnother concern that India could face due to the virus outbreak in China is job cuts. With lower scope of production activities, some companies will be forced to lay off contractual labourers.\nThis could have a negative effect on India's declining income levels.\nLower manufacturing and production activity due to the virus outbreak could pull down India's Industrial output, which is also not in good shape. To sum it up, a fall in manufacturing output along with ticking inflation and supply constraints could worsen India's growth outlook further.\nAt the time of writing this article, the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak stood at 1,488 with a sharp jump in the number of confirmed cases at over 65,000.\nThe situation in China remains critical with 121 news deaths on Friday while Japan registered its first death, the third fatality outside China."}, {"content": "Suspected coronavirus case in Patna, girl returns from China with symptoms.

The previous balance pointed to 7736 infected people and 170 dead. The numbers announced refer to the last 24 hours and represent 43 more deaths and almost two thousand more cases of infection compared to the latest data provided by Chinese authorities. The vast majority of cases occurred in Hubei Province and its capital, Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. According to the daily report of the National Health Commission, updated at 4 am (20 pm on Thursday in Lisbon), the number of patients in serious condition is 1527, while 171 people have already been discharged. The outbreak began in December in the city of Wuhan, capital of Hubei province in central China, and on Thursday the World Health Organization (WHO) declared an international public health emergency as the epidemic has spread to more than a dozen countries. In addition to China and the Chinese territories of Macau and Hong Kong, there are more than 50 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus in 19 other countries \u2014 in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Vietnam, Nepal, Malaysia, the United States, Canada , France, Germany, Italy, Australia, Finland, UAE, Cambodia, Philippines and India. According to Reuters, two cases were detected in the UK this Friday, the first in the country. Russia also announced that the first two cases were detected in the country, in a couple of Chinese nationality. The Italian government declared a state of emergency on Friday after the first two cases of coronavirus were identified in two Chinese tourists who were visiting Rome - authorities are now trying to figure out what their itinerary has been since they arrived in Italy . Singapore, in turn, announced this Friday that the entry of all visitors who have been to China recently was banned and also suspended the issuance of visas for all people with Chinese passports \u2013 the ban goes into effect this Saturday. Mongolia had also already announced that it would close its land borders with China (as well as Russia, North Korea and Vietnam) to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. An international public health emergency presupposes the adoption of prevention and coordination measures on a global scale. To declare it, WHO considers three criteria: an extraordinary situation, risk of rapid expansion to other countries and coordinated international response. This is the sixth time WHO has declared an international public health emergency. The Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the new coronavirus outbreak, has been isolated from the world for a week, as has almost the entirety of Hubei province, where 56 million people live, unable to leave the region. The United States and Japan withdrew part of their fellow citizens from Wuhan. Portugal will also repatriate citizens from the same Chinese city, along with other European countries. Russia announced on Thursday its intention to close 4250 kilometers of border with China and Kazakhstan ordered the closure of bus, plane and train connections with the same neighboring country. The US advised its citizens not to travel to China because of the new coronavirus, raised the alert level by one level, and advised Americans to leave Chinese territory. Americans &quot;currently in China should explore the possibility of leaving the country using commercial means,&quot; the State Department said in a statement posted on its website. On the other hand, it requested that \u201call non-essential employees of the United States Government postpone their trip to China because of the new coronavirus\u201d, Several airlines decided to suspend or reduce their flights to mainland China in the face of the spread of the new coronavirus .

China extends quarantine to 33 million people. Balance is 26 dead, two outside the epicenter of the outbreak. China announced this Friday the death of a person from the coronavirus near the Russian border. It is the second fatality victim outside the epicenter of the outbreak, originating in the city of Wuhan, bringing the death toll to 26. The victim died in Heilongjiang, a province in northeastern China, local authorities told the France-Presse news agency without providing further details. The province is more than 1,800 kilometers from Wuhan. Authorities have announced that they will urgently build a hospital to attack the coronavirus and have confirmed that the number of patients infected with the virus, identified as 2019-nCoV, has risen to 881. The hospital, according to state television CCTV, is being built in the outskirts of Wuhan - a city with 11 million inhabitants and the epicenter of the crisis -, with the works having started this Thursday and should be concluded on February 3rd. At a time when China has extended its quarantine to 33 million people, the idea of \u200b\u200bbuilding a new specialized hospital is to centralize infected patients, replicating the situation in 2003, when the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome epidemic occurred, similar to the current one coronovirus and which caused more than 700 deaths. That year, a specialized clinic was built in Beijing in Xiaotangshang, on the outskirts of the capital, within a week. The outbreak comes at a time when millions of Chinese travel on the occasion of the Lunar New Year, which starts this Saturday. According to the Ministry of Transport, the country must register a total of three billion internal trips in this period. China is at the &quot;most critical&quot; point when it comes to preventing and controlling the virus, warn officials, who have quarantined at least ten cities, affecting more than 20.5 million people.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said this Thursday, on the second day of its Emergency Committee meeting, that &quot;this is not the time&quot; to declare the current outbreak an international public health emergency. &quot;The role of WHO is to ensure that the global public health response to any new outbreak is rapid, robust and comprehensive, particularly given the geographic distribution of cases,&quot; recalls Jeremy Farrar, director of the non-governmental organization (NGO) Wellcome , dedicated to health research. Speaking to Expresso, from Davos, where he participates in the World Economic Forum, the director of the NGO emphasizes that \u201cthis outbreak is extremely worrying\u201d. \u201cA big concern is the variety of symptoms this virus is causing. Some people are being affected and are infectious, despite having only very mild symptoms or possibly not showing any symptoms at all,\u201d he warns.

SINGAPORE: The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that infected more people in China than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 has now spread across the globe. \n While we are learning more about the virus daily, questions are being raised about its rapid spread. One possibility is that this development could be related to climatic conditions. \n CLIMATE, WEATHER AND FLU SEASONALITY \n There is reason to believe that the seasonal pattern of novel coronavirus pneumonia may be similar to that of influenza infection and SARS, and thus cases may sharply fall by May, when temperatures in China warm up. \n In countries with temperate climates such as China and the United States, the flu season usually starts in December with a peak in January or February, after which cases decrease. \n SARS disappeared in the northern summer of 2003 and has not reappeared significantly since. This seasonality of influenza and other respiratory viruses in temperate countries is thought to be related to factors that affect infectiousness (person to person spread) such as the dryness of the air, ambient air temperature and possibly ultraviolet solar radiation. \n Human factors may also contribute to the spread of influenza during the colder winters since more time may be spent indoors, presumably in closer contact with other persons. \n The 2019-nCoV appears to be similar to other respiratory viruses such as influenza or the common cold (rhinovirus), which are spread by large droplets of saliva or phlegm from one person to another (either directly by cough or sneeze) or by contact. That happens when a person touches a contaminated surface and then touches his or her nose, mouth or eyes, inadvertently transmitting the virus. \n In fact, studies have shown that these respiratory droplets spread farther when the air is cold and dry. \n Studies done many years ago showed that the \u201cregular\u201d coronavirus (which is one of the causes of the common cold) can survive on surfaces 30 times longer in places with a temperature of 6 degrees Celsius compared to those where the temperature is 20 degrees Celsius and humidity levels are high. \n More recently, scientists from Hong Kong University (HKU) including Professor Malik Peiris and Professor Seto Wing Hong showed that low temperatures and low relative humidity allowed the SARS virus to survive much longer than they would in high temperatures and humidity. \n  \n The HKU team argued that this may be the reason warm and humid Southeast Asian countries did not have SARS outbreaks, unlike Hong Kong and Singapore where in their words, there is \u201cintensive use of air-conditioning\u201d. \n Thus, just as with influenza, the 2019-nCoV may slow down when the sun starts to shine more and the weather warms up in temperate and subtropical countries. \n LESSONS FROM SARS \n The SARS epidemic occurred 17 years ago and, since then, public health institutions, medical and laboratory science professionals, and the infectious diseases community are much better prepared to respond to novel and emerging infections globally. \n The improvements in communications and social media are undeniable. The genetic sequence of this new type of severe pneumonia in Wuhan was shared relatively early. \n This allowed countries all over the world to develop fast and accurate tests: These were not available during the initial weeks of SARS outbreak. \n Then, we had to depend on clinical examinations and contact tracing to determine who really was infected with SARS. Near the end of the epidemic, we were able to test everyone and we found out that we had actually missed a significant number of cases \u2013 these were only diagnosed after they had recovered. \n This has been the biggest difference in that now, low-resourced countries like Nepal and Cambodia are able to conduct relatively fast and accurate diagnosis on-site without having to wait for samples to be sent overseas. \n Given that the genetic information about the novel coronavirus was available even before countries had patients with the virus, many labs in advanced countries, including Singapore, are already working on blood tests for rapid detection and studying the immune response to help vaccine development. A trial to test anti-viral treatments has already been initiated in China and is being planned elsewhere. \n CONTACT TRACING AND TRAVEL BANS \n A basic public health approach to any outbreak is the use of contact tracing. \n  \n This means that for any patient who is found to be ill, close family members and other persons that he or she had close contact with during the incubation period will be notified that they were exposed to a sick person and quarantined for a further full incubation period, which for this novel infection is indicated to be 14 days. \n During the Ebola virus outbreak of 2014, this type of contact tracing was done very manually in many settings, although there were a number of mobile applications which were piloted. \n For this 2019 virus infection outbreak, much effort is being placed on high-tech contact tracing. It is too early to tell if this will be more effective, but any method to help contacts monitor themselves during the incubation period and detect symptoms may certainly help to decrease community transmission. \n Public health measures including screening and quarantining are similar to what was done for SARS and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), although there have been broader approaches to travellers without direct contact with infected patients because of the extent of community spread in China. \n Given that we are not sure as to what extent asymptomatic persons can transmit the virus, many countries have decided to close their borders to Chinese nationals, as they cannot rely on temperature screening to detect who is potentially contagious and necessitating quarantine. \n Many countries are also quarantining their own citizens and permanent residents returning from China, in an effort to limit introduction of this virus into the community. \n During SARS, the World Health Organization (WHO) imposed global travel restrictions and advisories. When a travel restriction is in effect, a country may feel the need to quickly get the ban lifted and reduce its aggressive screening and case finding. This may have contributed to the resurgence of SARS in Toronto after the initial period of good control. \n This time round, different countries have introduced their own travel restrictions which are probably more appropriate to the different situations and their relations with China. \n Travel bans are always controversial as they tend to have significant unintended consequences and have to be actually instituted before the virus appears in the country. Otherwise, they are relatively pointless. \n Among the concerns about the travel bans instituted this time during the coronavirus is the fact that we do not know how extensive the spread is from people without symptoms. \n  \n If this is really very widespread, then a blanket travel ban will have limited effects by now as the virus is probably silently spreading among and through most countries. Once there is documented local transmission in a country, as in Germany and the United States, the goal has to be containing the local transmission while at the same time preventing re-introduction of the virus. \n Overall, the key strategy has to be good contact tracing and widespread testing so that every case can be identified, tested and treated. That way the chain of transmission can be broken and the virus stopped in its tracks even before the warm weather kicks in. \n VACCINES AND DRUG TREATMENTS \n Unfortunately, the current way in which drug and vaccine development in modern medicine happens is very much driven by financial considerations. Unlike for example defence or homeland security, the question that always comes up when it comes to treating and preventing human disease is: \u201cIs this financially viable?\u201d \n As SARS disappeared 17 years ago and MERS has only occurred sporadically, primarily in the Middle East, there has been no incentive for the pharmaceutical industry to invest the funds needed to develop appropriate drugs and vaccines. \n All the interest and enthusiasm which came with SARS disappeared when the virus did not reappear after a couple of seasons. Governments had other priorities and most have actually left this part of national security to private industry. \n Hence, if and when the novel coronavirus disappears in May and does not reappear next October or November, we can predict that drug and vaccine development will likely die a natural death. \n That is unfortunately the way of the world and hopefully something can be done to change this. But that will require a massive global mindset change. Given the frequency with which these emerging viral infections occur, the world can ill- afford to continue along this road. \n Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram \n Assistant Professor Jyoti Somani, Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, NUS and Professor Paul Ananth Tambyah, Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, NUS and President, Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection. \n Editor's Note: A previous headline to this commentary referred to hot and dry climate.

Disposable rubber gloves are indispensable in the global fight against the new coronavirus, yet a month\u2019s lockdown in stricken Malaysia where three of every five gloves are made has upended the supply chain and threatens to hamstring hospitals worldwide.\nThe world\u2019s biggest maker of medical gloves by volume, Top Glove Corp Bhd (TPGC.KL), has the capacity to make 200 million gloves a day, but a supplier shutdown has left it with only two weeks\u2019 worth of boxes to ship them in, its founder told Reuters.\nWe can\u2019t get our gloves to hospitals without cartons, Executive Chairman Lim Wee Chai said in an interview. Hospitals need our gloves. We can\u2019t just supply 50% of their requirement.\nThe virus, which emerged in China at the end of last year, has left Malaysia with the highest number of infections in Southeast Asia at nearly 1,800 cases, with 17 deaths. To halt transmission, the government has ordered people to stay home from March 18 to April 14.\nGlove makers and others eligible for exemption can operate half-staffed provided they meet strict safety conditions. Still, the Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association (MARGMA) said it was lobbying almost every hour to return the industry to full strength to minimize risk to the global fight.\nWe\u2019re shut down, said Evonna Lim, managing director at packaging supplier Etheos Imprint Technology. We fall under an exempted category but still need approval.\nDr Celine Gounder, an infectious diseases specialist at the New York University School of Medicine, said she was using up to six times as many gloves as normal each day due to the number of patients with COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.\nIf we get to the point where there is a shortage of gloves, that\u2019s going to be a huge problem because then we cannot draw blood safely, we cannot do many medical procedures safely.\nGLOBAL CALL\nWith glove supplies dwindling, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on its website this month said here some gloves could be used beyond their designated shelf life. On Tuesday, the United States lifted a ban on imports from Malaysian glove maker WRP Asia Pacific who it had previously accused of using forced labor.\nBritain\u2019s Department of Health & Social Care has urged Malaysian authorities to prioritize the production and shipment of gloves that are of utmost criticality for fighting COVID-19, showed a letter dated March 20 to glove maker Supermax Corp (SUPM.KL) and shared with Reuters.\nMARGMA is considering rationing due to the extremely high demand, its president Denis Low said. You can produce as many gloves as you can but then there\u2019s nothing to pack them into.\nUnder normal circumstances, Top Glove can meet less than 40% of its own packaging needs. For the remainder, it said just 23% of suppliers have gained approval to operate at half strength.\nWe are lobbying almost every hour, we are putting in a lot of letters to the ministry, said Low. We are lobbying hard for the chemical suppliers and we want to ensure that the printers are also being given approval and any other supporting services, even transportation.\nMalaysia\u2019s Ministry of International Trade and Industry on Tuesday said it had received masses of applications to operate through the lockdown, and that it was seeking cooperation from industries to give way to those producing essential goods.\nAUTOMATION\nDeveloped economies are home to only a fifth of the world\u2019s population yet account for nearly 70% medical glove demand due to stringent medical standards. At 150, U.S. glove consumption per-capita is 20 times that of China, latest MARGMA data showed.\nMARGMA expects demand to jump 16% to 345 billion gloves this year, with Malaysia\u2019s market share rising two percentage points to 65%. Thailand usually follows at about 18% and China at 9%.\nTop Glove said orders have doubled since February and it sees sales rising by a fifth in the next six months. Its stock, with a market value of about $3.5 billion, has risen by a third this year versus a fall of 16% in the wider market.\nThe company, with customers in 195 economies, registered the highest net money inflow last week among listed Malaysian firms, along with peer Hartalega Holdings Bhd (HTHB.KL), showed MIDF Research data. Other glove makers include Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd (KRIB.KL) and Careplus Group Bhd (CARE.KL).\nWe are fortunate enough to be in essential goods, said Lim. These few months and at least the next six months will be an all-time high in terms of sales volume, revenue and profit.\nWith more than 80% of its 44 factories worldwide automated, Top Glove itself is less impacted by the lockdown than its more labor-intensive domestic suppliers. Packaging woes aside, however, ramping up production could turn under-supply into over-supply when the coronavirus outbreak finally subsides.\nThis outbreak will create awareness and make humankind healthier, said Lim. People will pay more attention, they will invest more, they will buy more so demand will be more."}, {"content": "FOREX-Yen steadies on virus anxiety, euro hit by weak growth outlook. * Graphic: World FX rates in 2020 tmsnrt.rs/2RBWI5E\n* China virus uncertainty weighs on markets\n* Euro takes a hit before GDP data\n* Sterling sees positives in cabinet reshuffle\nBy Stanley White\nTOKYO, Feb 14 (Reuters) - The Japanese yen held onto gains against the dollar on Friday, as fresh doubts about the scale of the coronavirus outbreak supported demand for safe-haven currencies.\nThe Chinese yuan nursed losses as the flu-like virus, which emerged late last year in China\u2019s central Hubei province, slammed the brakes on consumer spending and manufacturing.\nThe euro languished at multi-year lows versus the dollar and the Swiss franc as investors grow more pessimistic about the outlook in the euro zone before the release of gross domestic product data later on Friday.\nIn contrast, the pound rode a wave of optimism into Asia on Friday due to hopes that a British cabinet reshuffle will lead to more expansionary fiscal policy to support growth.\nOfficials in Hubei stunned financial markets on Thursday by announcing a sharp increase in new infections and deaths from the coronavirus, reflecting the adoption of a new method to diagnose the illness.\nUncertainty about the real extent of the epidemic is likely to discourage investors from taking on excessive risk until there is sufficient evidence that its spread has slowed.\n\u201cThere is a return of risk aversion, so yen and other safe-haven assets have risen, but reaction so far has been temporary and limited,\u201d said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.\n\u201cThe change of reporting standards in China is a concern.

But, she added, &quot;the initial story will determine the risk and because of that risk, measures of social isolation are advised&quot;. &quot;If the Portuguese have already been in their homes in Wuhan in the last 14 days, they have not had contact with people or animals, they have not been exposed to anything, they have no symptoms, there is no reason to put them in social isolation&quot;, defended Gra\u00e7a Freitas. For the responsible of the Portuguese health authority, these are &quot;common sense measures that should be taken&quot;. She also recalled that people only go to the hospital if they have symptoms. However, she stressed, authorities maintain contact with these people to ensure they do not have symptoms. &quot;Until now, the Portuguese protocol is like this and follows the guidelines of the World Health Organization&quot;, she concluded. Portugal has already activated public health devices due to the coronavirus from China and has the Hospital de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o, in Porto, Curry Cabral and Estef\u00e2nia, in Lisbon, on alert. In Portugal, the protocols established for situations of this kind were activated, reinforcing the Health 24 line in the National Health Service, through the number 800242424, and the medical help line, for screening and preventing that, in case of possible contagion, people do not fill the health centers and hospital emergencies. Some countries, such as the United States, Japan, France, Germany and Portugal, are preparing with the Chinese authorities the removal of their citizens from Wuhan, where there are also two dozen Portuguese. The Portuguese government has already announced that it wants to remove the Portuguese held in Wuhan by air. China raised to 106 dead and more than 4,000 infected the balance of the new coronavirus detected at the end of the year in Wuhan, capital of Hubei province (centre). Infected people can transmit the disease during the incubation period, which takes between a day and two weeks, without the virus being detected."}, {"content": "canada to stop people with covid-19 symptoms boarding domestic flights, trains. WINNIPEG, Manitoba - Canada will not allow anyone displaying symptoms of the COVID-19 respiratory illness to board domestic flights or inter-city passenger trains, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Saturday, the latest travel restriction aimed at curbing the coronavirus outbreak.  \n Trudeau's government has long urged Canadians feeling ill to stay at home, but he told reporters at his daily press conference outside his residence that Transport Canada had now formalized travel rules as COVID-19 cases steadily rise.  \n Trudeau had been in self-isolation after his wife tested positive for the virus. In a statement on Saturday, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau said she had \"received the all clear from my physician and Ottawa Public Health.\"  \n Canada's domestic travel restrictions will take effect on Monday at noon EDT.  \n Asked how screening would be different, Trudeau said the government was giving new tools to airlines and railways. Transport Canada later said airline and rail company staff would ask health questions of passengers and look for visible symptoms.  \n Even enhanced screening offers \"no guarantee\" that sick people will not board, as they can hide symptoms, Howard Njoo, Canada's deputy chief public health officer, said in a separate press conference.  \n Canada has confirmed 5,153 cases of coronavirus, and 55 deaths, health officials said. While case numbers are climbing, the rate of growth in British Columbia, the Pacific Coast province where community transmission was first reported, seems to be slowing, Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam said.  \n \"There are signs of hope,\" she told reporters in Ottawa.  \n In the province of Quebec, however, the number of cases jumped by 24% in the past day to nearly 2,500, more than double any other province. Four additional deaths raised Quebec's death toll to 22.  \n New police checkpoints were set to begin restricting non-essential traffic to eight Quebec regions on Saturday, Quebec Deputy Premier Genevieve Guilbault.  \n Ontario banned public events and gatherings of more than five people on Saturday.  \n Air Canada, the country's biggest airline, said it would operate a special flight returning Canadians from Algeria on Tuesday, with additional flights scheduled from Peru and Ecuador.  \n China's embassy in Ottawa tweeted that the Bank of China had on Friday donated medical supplies to Canada, including thousands of masks, goggles and gloves.  \n Trudeau has faced criticism at home for sending a shipment of protective equipment to China in February, before COVID-19 cases spiked in Canada.

The Directorate-General of Health says that the first suspected case of contamination by the coronavirus in Portugal is being evaluated. The results of the laboratory tests are awaited. According to the statement, the patient returned this weekend from China and is already at the Hospital de Curry Cabral, in Lisbon, the Reference Hospital for these situations. In Australia, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced this Saturday that the first case of a patient infected with the new coronavirus, which has killed 41 people in China, has been detected. In a statement released via Twitter, Morrison said he was a Chinese citizen from Wuhan, where the outbreak began, who traveled to Melbourne, Australia, on 19 January. \u201cHe is being treated in isolation in a hospital in Victoria [state capital]. The authorities are tracking and contacting all passengers who traveled on the same flight to Melbourne and all people who have had contact with the man since that time\u201d, said the Prime Minister, adding that \u201cit was already expected. for the virus to reach Australia\u201d. Scott Morrison assured that the Australian health services are prepared to diagnose, isolate and treat any case of the new coronavirus. Also the French Minister of Health, Agn\u00e8s Buzyn, announced this Friday that three cases of infection have been identified in the country: one patient in Bordeaux and two others in the Paris area. These were the first confirmed cases on the European continent, after the 14 cases of patients being screened in the UK were ruled out as negative \u2014 British authorities are looking for 2,000 travelers who have recently arrived from Wuhan for testing. The United States, France and Portugal also admitted this Saturday to withdraw their citizens from the Chinese city of Wuhan. However, confirmed and suspected cases of infection are multiplying in various parts of the world: Taiwan (three confirmed cases), Thailand (four cases), Japan (three cases), Nepal (one case), Malaysia (three cases), Korea South (two cases), USA (two cases), Singapore (three cases), Vietnam (at least one case), Macau (one case), France (three cases) and now Australia (one case). In China, authorities announced late on Friday that the death toll from the outbreak had risen to 41, and that there are now 1300 confirmed cases of infection. The 41st victim is a 62-year-old doctor who died in Wuhan after coming into contact with patients and contracting the virus. All over the country, steps are being taken to contain the spread of this coronavirus, called 2019-nCoV, just days away from the Chinese New Year celebration. Several New Year events were cancelled, including in Macau. At least 18 cities in Hubei Province, with a population of 60 million and whose capital is Wuhan, have enacted quarantine and imposed movement restrictions \u2014 with many cities having completely suspended transport services. In Wuhan, for example, there is no bus, metro or boat service and all planes and trains to other cities have been cancelled. According to the Chinese newspaper People&#39;s Daily\u200b this Saturday, a second hospital will be specially built \u201cwithin two weeks\u201d in the city of Wuhan to treat the sick. The new hospital will have a capacity of 1300 beds, to which will be added the places that are planned for the first hospital for patients with the virus, which will be built in ten days, as announced this Friday, adds the state newspaper. In Shanghai, all cinemas were closed until January 30 to try to stop the virus from spreading. The Chinese government has also ordered that entrances to public monuments, where thousands of people gather, be suspended or cancelled. This is the case with the Great Wall of China or Disneyland. According to Chinese media, more than 1200 military personnel and doctors were sent to Wuhan to help. The Chinese President called for this Saturday a special meeting of the Government with the aim of defining measures to combat the spread of the virus. Quoted by state television on Chinese New Year holiday, Xi Jinping warned of a &quot;serious situation&quot; and said the virus was &quot;accelerating its speed&quot;, also announcing that several resources and medical experts were being referred to the Wuhan region. Hong Kong has declared a state of emergency due to the new coronavirus and will keep primary and secondary schools closed for the next two weeks after the Chinese New Year break. Another of the measures announced this Saturday was the decision to block access to trains and planes originating in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus was detected for the first time at the end of last year. After three cases were detected in France, the European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) says it is likely that others will be registered in the European Union. In a statement released this Saturday, ECDC said that this development \u201cwas not unexpected\u201d, but that the fact that the cases have been identified proves that detection and confirmation of the new virus is working. The Center ensures that most European countries have the necessary capabilities to prevent and control an outbreak as soon as cases are detected. &quot;Most EU countries have plans and measures to contain this type of infection and Europe has well-equipped laboratories that can confirm probable cases, as well as hospitals prepared to treat patients accordingly&quot;, the note reads. The Portuguese authorities are cooperating with other European countries to strengthen support for national citizens who are in Wuhan, admitting the possibility of removing them from the Chinese. &quot;We are in contact with citizens and cooperating with other European countries to seek to strengthen support for Portuguese compatriots retained&quot; in Wuhan, said this Saturday to Lusa, a source in the office of the Secretary of State for Portuguese Communities, Berta Nunes. One of the scenarios, said the same source, is to remove the Portuguese from that city, \u201cif this is feasible in light of public health rules\u201d.

On Friday, the Government had indicated that the Portuguese embassy had identified 20 citizens who are residents there or who are visiting the city. The Wall Street Journal reports this Saturday that the United States is planning to withdraw its citizens from the city of Wuhan. According to the American newspaper, there are about a thousand American citizens in Wuhan. The US consulate is contacting them to offer a seat on the special plane that will depart this Sunday from the Chinese city. The aircraft seats just 230 people, including US consulate diplomats and US citizens and their families. Citizens who choose to leave the city will be responsible for the cost of the flight, a source in the operation told the newspaper. The South China Morning Post also states that France is preparing a bus service to take its citizens from that city to another part of China. &quot;The consulate general, in collaboration with the local authorities, plans to create a bus service to allow French citizens, their companions and children to travel from Wuhan to Changsha&quot;, reads the document sent to several French citizens by the consulate."}, {"content": "Xi Jinping's state visit to Japan postponed due to coronavirus.

Letters and parcels from China? Can be received without risk. Pneumonia vaccinations? Do not help against the new corona virus. Should You Eat Garlic? It is healthy, but there is no evidence that it protects against the pathogen. These questions and answers come from the World Health Organization (WHO) website. The WHO tries to fight myths under a rubric called myth busters. The United Nations authority wants to counter the rumors about the new corona virus. Because rumors, misinformation and conspiracy theories spread faster than the virus itself. At the end of 2019, a new virus broke out in China, 2019nCoV, closely related to the deadly Sars virus. Thousands of people have now been infected, hundreds have died, and several countries have long reported cases. Because the pathogen was still unknown last year and the consequences of the outbreak cannot yet be assessed, the need for knowledge is great: Google Trends recorded a rapidly increasing number of searches for the coronavirus in January. A demand that does not go unmet: In the past four weeks, more than 15 million tweets about the coronavirus have been posted on Twitter, and new news and assessments appear in the media every day. There are so many contributions that the WHO writes of an infodemy, an overabundance of information - correct, but also wrong. In general, a distinction must be made between unsecured information, out of context or false news, and conspiracy theories. For example, there is a story circulating online about a couple who allegedly left their two sick children at the airport. There is no evidence for this. The same applies to a video that spreads alleged facts about the virus in an alarmist tone. The allegations in it are partly exaggerated, partly unfounded, partly false, as the Correctiv portal has researched. But there are also conspiracy theories. It is said that the outbreak is based on a plot by Microsoft founder Bill Gates. That is also not true. Now this information may still be found harmless. However, the misinformation that is spreading around the new coronavirus is partly harmful, even life-threatening. For example, when they advertise alleged remedies or treatments. The Indian Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy advises homeopathic treatment of coronavirus lung disease. The effect of homeopathy beyond the placebo effect has not been proven. And it is rumored on Facebook that drinking a chemical solution called MMS will cure a coronavirus infection. This is not only wrong, but even life-threatening if used. Facebook, usually not known for its intensive engagement with false content, has now announced that it will remove relevant posts from its platform. Twitter not only wants to delete misleading posts, but also only display credible information when searching for the coronavirus, according to a blog post. The media dynamics that can be observed at the moment are not new. It is similar to that of other news situations - be it a terrorist attack or a plane crash: First something bad happens, then information spreads on social media in a matter of minutes, and finally media reports. People read posts or articles, looking for more information, for certainty. But because there is still little reliable knowledge, there is room for rumors, misinformation and even conspiracy theories. The effect is reinforced by the fact that the level of knowledge about the center of the news situation - in this case the coronavirus disease - can constantly change and what seems certain today could be refuted tomorrow. Nicole Kr\u00e4mer works as a professor of social psychology at the University of Duisburg-Essen and researches fake news, among other things. She sees several reasons for the spread of false and unsecured information: &quot;Much is still unclear about the coronavirus,&quot; she says, &quot;that creates uncertainty.&quot; And because the outbreak threatens to become a pandemic and everyone in Germany could at some point run the risk of being infected, the need for information is particularly great. People sent information they see too quickly, says Kr\u00e4mer - often without reading the message carefully. Images with particularly frightening motifs, such as photos from overcrowded hospital corridors with patients lying on the floor, fueled this: &quot;Some texts are certainly passed on because the power of images is so strong,&quot; says Kr\u00e4mer. We are all responsible for spreading false information. &quot;It is less relevant who puts the wrong message into the world, but rather who spreads it. And these are mostly people, not bots,&quot; says Kr\u00e4mer. But of course, misinformation is not just spread unknowingly. There are also actors who specifically disseminate the information, says Kr\u00e4mer. This could be lay people who just want attention, but also state actors who want to create unrest. In addition, when it comes to health issues, a lot is trusted in the experience of others, said communication scientist Markus Sch\u00e4fer from the University of Mainz to ZDF. Together with colleagues, he investigated how Internet users obtain information about health. According to this, almost every second respondent (46 percent) stated that they found out about health issues in personal conversations with family, friends and colleagues. 39 percent use the Internet for this, in the age group from 18 to 29 it was even 46 percent (specialist journal for online advice and computer-mediated communication: Sch\u00e4fer et al., 2019). But health issues are often very complex. &quot;This is why misinformation spreads so well in this area,&quot; says Sch\u00e4fer. Medicine is not an exact science. In medical practice, scientific knowledge and experience flow together. Sometimes there is more room for rumors than for scientific questions. The effect of such false information is problematic not only in the short term, but also in the long term. In psychology, one speaks of the false information effect: If one reads false information immediately after an event, this can lead to the fact that one should remember it - even if one should actually know that it is not correct (e.g. Loftus, 2005). &quot;This is normal in evolutionary psychology,&quot; says social psychologist Kr\u00e4mer. We first believed what we saw and didn&#39;t immediately doubt everything. The problem is that false information is received in the same way as facts. The wrong information can only be overwritten with difficulty. Therefore, even after people have read a correction, they can remember the wrong information. It becomes even more difficult when the misinformation you read fits into your own view of the world. Because we all tend to believe what we want to believe. In psychology this is called confirmation bias. In the case of the coronavirus, this is easy to observe: Anyone who wants to believe that the world is in the middle of a pandemic will find and share information that goes with it. Anyone who wants to believe that the pathogen is harmless will find the opposite information. It is currently unclear how deadly the virus really is - and whether the outbreak will take on global proportions. So how can you be sure that what you read is really correct? &quot;Anyone who sees a text online shouldn&#39;t just share it, but read it through,&quot; says social psychologist Kr\u00e4mer. It also helps to pay attention to the sources. Is a contribution based on scientific knowledge? Can what is written there be checked? Is someone just quoting from other media? What is the original source? Is there even one? This may sound trite, but it can effectively help identify misinformation. The media are also responsible for correcting reports if they originally contained incorrect information, said Kr\u00e4mer. Experts are already looking for a global media strategy for future disease outbreaks. &quot;We need effective media monitors to monitor how disease outbreaks are reported,&quot; wrote Ilona Kickbusch, professor of global health in Geneva, and Gabriel Leung, dean of medicine at Hong Kong University, in a contribution to the British Medical Journal. In the future, WHO should not only contact social media, but also work with well-known fact checkers. In this way you can also find out whether information is being withheld or critical journalists are being silenced. At the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organization WHO an accumulation of pneumonia of unknown cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Just a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days later, a group led by virologist Christian Drosten from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers are provisionally calling 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. The Chinese authorities suspect the source of the pathogen to be a food market in Wuhan, where not only fish and seafood but also exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected. Both Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic in 2002 and 2003, around 8,000 people were infected and more than 750 died. Between its discovery in 2012 and the end of 2019, around 2,500 people were infected with the Mers virus, and every third person died from it. In total, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example. Several thousand people have now become ill in China, some of them - most of them probably with previous illnesses - died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first cases of infection outside of China became known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been to Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who was returning from Wuhan, and on January 24, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia, which can be fatal. Since it is a viral disease, antibiotics won&#39;t help. It is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after a dozen or so cases among medical personnel became known. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. As it announced on January 24, the World Health Organization currently expects that an infected person will infect an average of 1.4 to 2.5 other people. If these numbers prove to be true, the virus is less contagious than Sars and so is the flu. The WHO recommends following general hygiene rules: You should wash your hands often and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals. It is not yet possible to say with certainty. The World Health Organization announced on January 28th that around a fifth of the reported cases would become seriously ill from the virus, so if in doubt they would have to be treated in intensive care. According to reports, the first fatalities were patients, some of whom had serious previous illnesses. People with previous illnesses are also particularly at risk from other infectious diseases - such as the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, i.e. change their genetic makeup. That can make them more dangerous to people in the course of an outbreak - but also the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate that is as high as that of the Sars outbreak.

The development was announced by WHO in view of the rapid rise in Covid-19 infections around the globe. Declaring it as a pandemic triggered a massive slump in stock markets across the world.

The global toll death toll has crossed 4,500 while India has recorded at least 73 positive cases.\nOil slides further\nAnother reason why domestic stock markets fell was a further slide in global crude oil prices. Oil prices have continued to slide since the major crash on March 6 following a meeting of the OPEC countries and Russia. A price war was triggered as Saudi slashed oil prices, resulting in the collapse of global crude oil prices.\nWhile prices had recovered slightly on March 11, the lower prices keep hurting sentiments of major oil companies in the country. Power and energy companies are also taking a pounding in the domestic stock market due to reduced prices. Though the general notion is that India benefits from any cut in global crude prices, the recent deep cut may not be ideal for the country.\nSharp fall in oil prices also has a greater impact on the equity market, as witnessed in the past few days. It could even disrupt the flow for foreign capital into the India market if crude prices keep falling.\nGlobal market rout\nNot just India but markets around the globe have witnessed carnage over the past few days due to the coronavirus outbreak.

It is only transmitted in a community way in one area and it seems that the epidemic has the possibility of beginning to remit soon,&quot; he said. The transmission zone is only Hubei, the province of China where Wuhan is located. &quot;There are Chinese provinces with fewer cases than other countries. It would be inconsistent to recommend not traveling to the entire country,&quot; he said. Sim\u00f3n explained that three doctors and a nurse will accompany the Spanish evacuees from Wuhan on their flight, which took off this morning from the Chinese city. Citizens of Nordic countries traveling on board will be taken to their countries of origin as soon as they land at Torrej\u00f3n de Ardoz airport, in Spain. The Italian Council of Ministers has approved this Friday a decree declaring a state of emergency for the coronavirus, following the decision of the World Health Organization to decree the global emergency. &quot;It is simply a matter of taking note of the WHO&#39;s decision,&quot; Italian government sources have said. The Government has allocated an initial five million euros to deal with the spread of the virus. The Minister of Health, Roberto Speranza, has explained that they are precautionary measures, and that in light of the international emergency declaration, the regulatory instruments for these cases have been activated. Italy already declared a state of health emergency when the SARS epidemic was registered in 2002. This mechanism, used for example after earthquakes or floods such as those in Venice, allows activating funds and mobilizing organizations, such as civil protection, in order to to prepare structures for welcoming people. Italian Prime Minister Guiseppe Conte confirmed on Thursday two cases of coronavirus, affecting two Chinese tourists who arrived in the country in January. As a precautionary measure, Italian authorities have decided to cancel air connections with China to prevent the spread of the outbreak. Also this Thursday, 6,000 passengers were blocked aboard a cruise ship in the Roman port of Civitavecchia in which there was a couple who had symptoms compatible with the coronavirus. Finally, after confirming the negative results of the tests, the passenger can disembark. &quot;We can confirm that two patients in England, members of the same family, have tested positive,&quot; announced the head of the English medical services, Chris Whitty, in a statement released by the Ministry of Health, in which they have not given more details about those affected to preserve their privacy. Outside of China, the epidemic has spread to a score of countries, accumulating around 130 cases. The two affected in England &quot;are receiving specialized care from the health services&quot; and &quot;infection control procedures are being used to prevent the virus from spreading,&quot; according to Whitty. British medical experts had already warned that it was &quot;highly probable&quot; that cases of coronavirus would be registered in the United Kingdom. &quot;The National Health Service is extremely well prepared and used to managing infections and we are already working quickly to identify anyone who has come into contact with patients to prevent further spread,&quot; added Whitty. Thailand, the country with the most affected after China, with 19 cases, has confirmed the first direct contagion between humans produced within the country. India has also confirmed its first positive, reports \u00c1ngel Mart\u00ednez. This is an Indian student from Wuhan, who had been in an isolation ward for a week in the Thrissur district, in the southern state of Kerala. Russia also announced the first two confirmed cases on Friday. While the plane chartered by the British Government that transports its citizens and the twenty evacuated Spaniards has already landed at the British air base of Brize Norton, other countries continue the repatriation of their nationals. The military plane with the first 180 French returnees from Wuhan landed this Friday at noon at the Istres air base, in southern France, Silvia Ayuso reports. Although they had tested negative for the coronavirus 2019-nCoV before taking off from the Chinese city, one of the passengers presented symptoms during the flight and was immediately taken to the Marseilles hospital in Timone, the Minister of Health, Agn\u00e8s Buzyn, announced that went to receive the returnees. The others were transferred to a holiday center in Carry-le-Rouet, a town on the Mediterranean coast 30 kilometers from Marseille, where they will have to spend the next 14 days in quarantine. The enclosure meets the requirements that the authorities had imposed when looking for a place to welcome returnees: \u201cA criterion above all sanitary with isolated rooms, which is also close to a hospital and, furthermore, which is pleasant and warm. The Carry-le-Rouet holiday center met all of those criteria, \u201dBuzyn explained. Although the returnees, who must undergo tests twice a day to verify that they do not have symptoms, will be able to move freely around the compound, they will not be able to leave it - several gendarmes stationed abroad will ensure that no one leaves or enters without permission - and they must carry masks when in common areas. In addition, the minister said, although they may receive packages, family visits will not be allowed. More than fifty health professionals will take turns during the next two weeks to accompany and supervise the repatriated citizens, to whom a new contingent could join in the next few days, since as announced by the European Commission, it is expected that a new plane is chartered to transport other French citizens who wish to leave Wuhan, as well as other foreigners who can also do so, in principle mainly Europeans. In Paris, the Pasteur Institute announced this Friday that it has managed to isolate the strains of the coronavirus detected in France and has set up a working group to search for possible solutions, including a vaccine that could be available in 20 months. As explained by its scientific director, Christophe d&#39;Enfert, the idea is to work on a modification of the measles vaccine. &quot;We have developed a platform that in eight months will allow us to obtain an attenuated virus that we can test in animals,&quot; he explained. &quot;If all goes well,&quot; he stressed, the clinical phase could be entered at the end of August, he added. Taking as a model the work done on Ebola, he said, it should last a year and, again &quot;if everything goes well&quot;, a vaccine could be available in a period of time of 20 months. Meanwhile, a flight organized by the South Korean government has landed this Friday in Seoul with 368 people on board, the first of a series of four to rescue people of this nationality. One of those on the list was unable to board due to fever, and 18 of the passengers have been sent to hospital upon arrival. The rest of the returnees will be quarantined in isolation centers in the cities of Asan and Jincheon, about 80 kilometers south of Seoul, a decision that has sparked protests among its residents. The United States, which has issued a &quot;do not travel&quot; alert to China due to the coronavirus, has indicated that it will send a second plane on February 3 after which this Wednesday it repatriated more than 200 of its citizens. Japan also asks its citizens from this Friday not to travel to China if it is not strictly necessary. This country on Thursday repatriated a third batch of nationals on a charter flight carrying 149 passengers. Eight of them were taken to a medical center by ambulance, as reported by the Japanese television station NHK. The rest will be tested to determine if they are carriers of the virus and, while awaiting the results, will be housed in facilities offered by the government in Tokyo. Colombia, Costa Rica and El Salvador are also considering a joint evacuation of their nationals, who would leave Wuhan by land and would complete the quarantine in another Chinese city. If they do not show symptoms, these citizens will be able to travel to any other locality in the People&#39;s Republic or return to their nations of origin. As reported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Bogot\u00e1, 14 of their compatriots have expressed their desire to get out of the focus of the epidemic. Following the WHO declaration of international emergency, El Salvador has banned the entry of travelers from China to its borders. &quot;We hope it is a temporary measure,&quot; said the president of the Central American country, Nayib Bukele, at a press conference. The Philippines adopted a similar veto on Friday for those from Hubei province. Singapore has banned all Chinese or non-Chinese visitors who have recently traveled to China. The measure, one of the most restrictive so far to try to contain the spread of the virus, will be effective from this Saturday, and will also apply to passengers in transit. As an exception, there are residents and holders of long-term permits, such as work or student visas. Mongolia, which shares a border of almost 5,000 kilometers with China, has announced the closure of its access to foreign citizens from its neighboring country at least until February 2. It has also asked for the return of its nationals who are currently in China, and who will have until the 6th to return. Ulan Bator is also trying to get thirty of its citizens trapped in Wuhan out. Hours after the emergency committee of the World Health Organization (WHO) decided on Thursday night in Geneva to declare an international emergency due to the outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus, the Chinese government has assured that it is capable of \u201cstopping and defeat \u201dthe epidemic. In a statement, the National Health Commission has assured that &quot;China is confident and capable of effectively containing the new epidemic and ultimately defeating it.&quot; The statement emphasizes that Beijing &quot;attaches great importance to the prevention and control of pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus and has taken the strictest measures to curb the epidemic.&quot; The Chinese government has sent two planes to Malaysia and Thailand to repatriate to about 200 citizens residing in Wuhan, and who were abroad when the closure of the city was announced in the middle of the holiday season for the Chinese New Year, as announced on Friday by the Chinese civil aviation authority. These are two Boeing 737s from the Chinese company Xiamen Airlines. The Chinese Embassy in Japan has also asked the Shanghai-based Spring Airlines to provide charter flights for the Wuhan people who have been held in Japan. The first of those flights will depart from Tokyo airport this Saturday. The decision has been made, according to the spokeswoman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Hua Chunying, given the &quot;practical difficulties&quot; that these residents, &quot;especially those from Wuhan&quot;, have encountered abroad. According to data from the local government of Hubei, at the time of the blockade of Wuhan and fifteen other cities with a total population of 46 million people, some 40,000 residents of the province were abroad. Among them, the largest contingent, some 10,000 people, was concentrated in Thailand, the number one destination for Chinese tourists. The head of the infectious diseases department of the prestigious Sino-Japanese Friendship Hospital in Beijing, Zhan Qinghhuan, addressed a press conference this Friday to those recovering from the coronavirus infection. Although they will develop antibodies that will initially protect them from a new infection, these &quot;may not remain long&quot; in the immune system, so &quot;there is a risk that those who have been cured may be re-infected. They must protect themselves adequately,&quot; he insisted. , according to the newspaper South China Morning Post. In the last 24 hours, 47 patients across China who have overcome the infection have been discharged. Faced with growing criticism of the way in which the local authorities in Wuhan and Hubei managed the beginning of the crisis, the first layoffs have already begun to take place. Tang Zhihong, head of the Health Department in the city of Huanggang, neighboring Wuhan and the second in the country by number of cases of infection, was the first official to be relieved of her position. Huanggang has reported close to 500 confirmed cases and 12 deaths in his municipality, but when asked by a team of central government inspectors on television cameras about the situation at one of the hospitals under his charge, Tang was unable to respond. . &quot;I only know how many beds she has, but not how many people she is treating,&quot; she acknowledged. Tang&#39;s response had generated a wave of negative comments on Chinese social media. Her admission came after Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang acknowledged earlier in the week that the municipal government did not release the information available to it in the first weeks of the crisis as quickly as possible. Zhou, however, specified that, if he had withheld data, it was because he did not receive authorization from higher levels of government to release it."}, {"content": "China identifies 62 people infected with unknown virus. Scientists warn that there are already 1723. Chinese authorities have announced that there are 17 more people infected in the center of the country with a new form of viral pneumonia, which has caused two deaths and has put other countries on alert. In total, 62 cases of the new coronavirus were registered by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, with 19 being discharged from hospital, while two men in their 60s - one with serious pre-existing conditions - died from the disease. At least half a dozen countries in Asia have adopted exceptional measures. The number of people infected with the virus probably exceeds a thousand cases and is much higher than that advanced by local authorities, according to British investigators. In an article published on Friday by scientists at a research center at the Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine in London, it is pointed out that the number of people infected in the Chinese city will be much higher. Researchers at the Center for the Global Analysis of Infectious Diseases, which advises institutions such as the World Health Organization (WHO), estimate that &quot;a total of 1,723 cases&quot; in Wuhan had had symptoms of the disease as of 12 January. The warning of the spread of the virus was given this week by the WHO, after the first cases detected outside China were known, in Thailand and Japan, with the three patients having visited Wuhan recently. Cases of viral pneumonia fueled fears about a potential epidemic after research identified the disease as a new type of coronavirus, a species of virus that causes respiratory infections in humans and animals and is transmitted through coughing, sneezing or contact. physicist.

SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST"}, {"content": "Identified the first infected in the United States by the Wuhan coronavirus. The new Wuhan virus, which has already left six dead in China and hundreds affected, has crossed the Pacific. A man in his 30s who traveled to that Chinese region was diagnosed with the virus last week in Seattle, Washington State, as confirmed by the United States Center for Disease Control (CDC) on Tuesday, while the entire country was glued to television to follow the impeachment against Donald Trump in the Senate. The Wuhan virus is a new coronavirus called 2019-nCov that is transmitted between humans and causes respiratory diseases. It was first detected less than a month ago. From this city, located in the central area of \u200b\u200bthe Chinese territory and where 11 million people live - more than London or New York -, the pathogen began to spread to neighboring provinces. Last Friday, for example, there were no positives out there, but now there are 38 cases spread over 15 other large Chinese cities and it has jumped to four countries in Southeast Asia. The Seattle patient, whose identity is unknown at the moment, is admitted to the Everett Regional Medical Center, the capital of Snohomish County (Washington). He is stable, responds to treatment, and is not considered a risk. The CDC has also explained that the patient had no symptoms when he landed on January 15 in the US He went to the doctor last Sunday and was hospitalized for pneumonia. The patient did not visit any of the Wuhan markets, where numerous cases of those affected by the virus were confirmed, but he did visit the region, Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC&#39;s department of respiratory diseases, told reporters. The authorities are looking for all the people who have been in contact with the patient these days, Messonnier explained. They do not expect there to be more cases. Since last Friday, the 17th, the CDC had imposed special controls to monitor the possible entry of the virus into the country at the busiest airports on the West Coast, San Francisco and Los Angeles, and New York. They are the three airports with the most passengers from the Wuhan region. The CDC has posted about 100 workers to these airports and has installed quarantine rooms. The health authorities had been alert for two weeks. On January 11, they had published a Level 1 health warning for passengers who had been in Wuhan. A group of experts from the Center for Infectious Diseases Epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong suggests that the reality is even more worrying than the data offered by China. According to a report from him prepared in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) and presented this Tuesday, the total number of infected may already touch 1,500: 1,343 in Wuhan and 115 in the rest of the country. In addition to China and the US, there have been cases of people with this virus detected in South Korea, Thailand, Japan and Taiwan, where a 55-year-old woman was also recognized this Tuesday with the disease. As in previous cases, she traveled to Wuhan in recent weeks. The island&#39;s Minister of Health, Chen Shih-chung, has assured that none of the relatives of the patient have any symptoms, similar to those of ordinary pneumonia, and that 46 other people who were in contact with her during the journey from aircraft have been placed under observation. In addition, the Philippines and Australia have also announced that they have taken action against the first suspected cases in their territory. The WHO paid a visit to Wuhan on Monday with a group of Chinese health experts, led by Dr. Zhong Nanshan, director of the State Laboratory of Infectious Diseases in Guangzhou and a national eminence in the matter. According to this conglomerate of experts, 15 medical employees in the city have contracted the virus, confirming human-to-human transmission - an extreme ruled out until last weekend. The escalation of this new coronavirus, discovered two weeks ago, is reminiscent of the SARS epidemic, with which it bears genetic similarities. The 2002 epidemic, also originating in China, killed 700 people worldwide. The WHO will hold an emergency meeting tomorrow Wednesday to decide whether to declare &quot;an international public health emergency&quot; due to the outbreak. The Chinese State Council, for its part, has also scheduled a press conference in which it will detail the evolution of the virus in the last hours."}, {"content": "Xi Jinping learned of the seriousness of the coronavirus two weeks before public speaking on the matter. Chinese state media on Saturday released a speech by President Xi Jinping that indicated that the Chinese leader was aware of the potential seriousness of the new coronavirus outbreak weeks before the population was alerted to the issue. At the start of the outbreak, Xi Jinping adopted a stance that many considered to be inactive, fueling a wave of criticism of the Chinese government&#39;s response to the crisis, which forced him this week to come to the forefront of combating the health crisis, launch a purge of Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leaders in Hubei Province, where the new virus emerged, and initiate reform in the way China handles health emergencies. In an unprecedented way, Chinese citizens, forced into a quarantine of gigantic proportions \u2014 tens of millions of people are confined to their homes, or subjected to control measures that severely limit their movement or contact with other people \u2014 demand more transparency in the State, more information about what&#39;s going on. Xi Jinping, as a source of authority in a highly centralized state, is forced to open some windows, letting a system used to secrecy air out, while tightening control elsewhere. It is through this prism that one should read this Sunday&#39;s release of the speech given on February 3 by Xi Jinping in which he reports having given orders, on January 7, during a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Politburo, the most powerful body in the Chinese policy to implement measures to prevent infections by the new coronavirus. The speech is published in Qiushi magazine \u2014 described by the People&#39;s Daily, the official newspaper of the CPC, as &quot;a reference publication of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China&quot;. In this speech, accompanied by photos of Xi and other leaders in blue paper masks, the Chinese President says he authorized the unprecedented quarantine in Wuhan starting January 23 \u2014 a city of 11 million people, which is a major node of rail, river and air transport, with a technological and automotive production center for international brands, and also an important area of \u200b\u200bagricultural production. Although Xi has reported his actions since the beginning of January, it was not until January 20th that Xi publicly spoke of the new disease and Chinese authorities acknowledged the existence of the epidemic in the city of Wuhan, which by then had already spread to other Chinese cities and other countries. It was on that day that authorities in Beijing confirmed that Covid-19 is spread between humans, at which point alarmism began to take on a new tone. Xi Jinping&#39;s advisers are believed to have believed that the release of this speech will show that the Chinese president was aware of the crisis from the beginning \u2014 they hope to defuse criticism for not appearing publicly to lead the actions against the emergency, which has already killed 1665 people. a total of 68,500 infections. &quot;The overall tone of the speech seems defensive,&quot; Minxin Pei, professor of government at Claremont McKenna College in California, told the New York Times. &quot;He wants to change the narrative, which so far has been very unfavorable to Chinese leaderships.&quot; &quot;I followed, at all times, the spread of the epidemic and the progress in the efforts to contain it, constantly issuing oral orders and instructions&quot;, guaranteed Xi Jinping, in the speech quoted by the New York Times.

DETROIT - Ford Motor Co <F.N> on Thursday moved to hoard cash on its balance sheet, drawing down $15.4 billion from two credit lines and suspending its dividend, in a move to bolster reserves to ride out damage to its business from the coronavirus pandemic.  \n The No. 2 U.S. automaker, whose shares closed off slightly after sinking as much as 8.9% earlier in the day, also abandoned its 2020 financial forecast and said the cash would be used to deal with a squeeze on capital caused by shutdowns in production due to the fast-spreading virus.  \n The move will give Ford more than $37 billion in cash, almost matching the revenue it reported in the fourth quarter. That dwarfs the company's market capitalization of about $18 billion.  \n Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said in a research note that corporate liquidity during the outbreak was \"top of mind\" and that U.S. automakers had strong balance sheets.  \n The coronavirus outbreak, which started in China last year, has caused about 219,000 infections and more than 8,900 deaths globally.  \n Comparing the current economic situation to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, Chief Executive Jim Hackett said Ford was putting in place safeguards to protect its business.  \n \"We're at war with the virus and Ford is going to win,\" Hackett told employees on a video conference.  \n Ford has come under fire from some analysts on Wall Street for moving too slowly to cut costs and restructure its business.  \n At the end of last year, it had booked only $3.7 billion of the projected $11 billion in charges it previously said it would take in its global restructuring.  \n Since then, the outbreak has spread globally, leading Ford, General Motors Co <GM.N> and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV <FCHA.MI>, <FCAU.N> on Wednesday to announce the shutdown of their North American plants to prevent the spread of the disease among their factory workers.  \n All three Detroit automakers have seen U.S. employees test positive for COVID-19, the contagious respiratory illness caused by the virus.  \n Electric carmaker Tesla Inc <TSLA.O> on Thursday suspended production at its California car plant, starting March 24, to help stem the spread of the coronavirus, and added that its cash position was strong enough to navigate this period of uncertainty.  \n  \n OUTLOOK REVISIONS  \n The outbreak has already hit other automakers and more are expected to slash their 2020 forecasts.  \n Evercore ISI analysts said in a research note that such actions \"will be an ongoing theme in addition to the removal of (stock) buybacks.\"  \n On Wednesday, German luxury automaker BMW AG <BMWG.DE> cut its 2020 profit outlook, saying it would be \"significantly lower\" than last year. Two days before that, Chinese automaker Great Wall Motor Co Ltd <601633.SS> also cut its 2020 sales and profit targets.  \n GM and FCA did not change their profit forecasts on Thursday.  \n \"We are dedicated to managing our cost structure against this dynamic environment,\" GM said in a statement. \"We continue to monitor the situation closely and will make any necessary decisions to stay resilient.\"  \n GM had $34.6 billion in liquidity at the end of 2019, including $17.3 billion in cash.  \n \"We are evaluating the impact of all steps being taken inside the company related to the coronavirus emergency on our current financial guidance,\" FCA said in a statement, adding it would provide an update when it has \"sufficient visibility on market conditions.\"  \n FCA had 23.1 billion euros ($24.94 billion) in liquidity at the end of 2019.  \n Shares of Uber Technologies Inc <UBER.N> closed up more than 38% on Thursday after Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said the ride-hailing company had plenty of cash on hand.  \n \"In any crisis, liquidity is key,\" he said on an investor call.  \n Ford said on Thursday it notified lenders it would borrow the unused amounts of the two credit lines, totaling $15.4 billion. The Dearborn, Michigan-based company had $22 billion in cash at the end of last year.  \n The dividend suspension will save Ford money at an annual rate of $2.4 billion.  \n The company said it was prioritizing financial flexibility and investments in future technologies such as self-driving cars and a series of important 2020 vehicle launches including a redesigned version of its top-selling F-150 full-size pickup truck.  \n Ford also withdrew its 2020 profit outlook. In February, before the coronavirus hit the United States, it offered a weaker-than-expected forecast for earnings in the range of 94 cents to $1.20 a share.  \n Ford said it would update its outlook when it reports first-quarter results on April 28.  \n Also on Thursday, Ford said it would offer new-car buyers up to six months of payment relief. Some U.S. dealers have begun to see sales drop off because of the virus, which has already drastically hurt demand in other countries.

LAGOS/ABUJA - An Italian man who has been confirmed as Nigeria's first coronavirus case after arriving from Milan was in the country for almost two full days, travelling through Lagos and visiting another state before being isolated.  \n The case is the first in sub-Saharan Africa. Authorities fear the virus could spread quickly in a region where health systems are already overburdened with cases of malaria, measles, Ebola and other infectious diseases.  \n Lagos, with 20 million people, is the biggest city in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country.

It said it had identified people who had \"direct contact\" with him before carrying out \"isolation, quarantine and disinfection protocol.\"  \n The Ogun state governor, in a separate media briefing, said 28 people had been placed in quarantine by the company the man worked for, although he did not mention it by name.  \n The case has prompted a scramble by Nigerian authorities to try to \"meet and observe\" all passengers who arrived on the same flight as the man and to identify the places he visited before being hospitalised.  \n \"We have started working to identify all the contacts of the person since he entered Nigeria and even those who were with him on the aircraft,\" Health Minister Osagie Ehanire told reporters on Friday in the capital, Abuja.  \n The Italian, whose country has been hit harder hit by the virus than any other in Europe, arrived on Feb. 24 on a Turkish Airlines flight that had a connection in Istanbul, said Lagos state commissioner for health, Akin Abayomi.  \n After spending the night in a hotel near the airport, he went on Feb. 25 to his place of work in neighbouring Ogun state, and stayed there until he developed a fever and body aches on the afternoon of Feb. 26, Abayomi told a news conference.  \n He was then transferred to a high containment facility in Yaba, Lagos state.  \n Ehanire said the infection was confirmed on Feb. 27 by the Virology Laboratory of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, and that the man was now quarantined and doing well.  \n Turkish Airlines did not immediately comment on the case. There are no confirmed cases in Turkey.  \n Nigerian stocks fell 1.63% to their lowest level in two months on Friday following the announcement of the coronavirus case.  \n The spread of the new coronavirus from China has hit global financial markets, and Nigeria's economy is at risk from the tumbling price of oil, which accounts for 90% of its foreign exchange earnings.  \n The latest World Health Organization figures indicate over 82,000 people have been infected, with over 2,700 deaths in China and 57 deaths in 46 other countries.  \n  \n LABORATORY NETWORK  \n Officials from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) are heading to Lagos to help address the case, and have activated its national Emergency Operations Centre.  \n International health organisation said they were working alongside their Nigerian counterparts.  \n Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) said it is in contact with NCDC and is working with the WHO and other partners to support the Nigerian government's response.  \n In a statement it said it had deployed one epidemiologist to Nigeria to support assessment and response to the outbreak, and has shipped 1,000 COVID-19 laboratory test kits to the country.  \n And the WHO, which has said it already has experts in Nigeria, has identified Nigeria as one of 13 \"high priority\" countries in Africa. Dr Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's emergencies programme, told a Geneva news conference on Friday that Nigeria had \"well-tested mechanisms for dangerous pathogens.\"  \n He said Nigeria was able to utilise a laboratory network that had been developed to handle cases of Lassa fever, monkeypox and influenza.  \n Schools and offices in Lagos provided hand sanitizer to people entering buildings on Friday.  \n \"There's a run on suppliers at the moment for hand sanitizer and masks,\" said Andrew Garza, chief operating officer of Lifestores Healthcare, a Lagos-based health technology company that provides inventory services to local pharmacies.  \n Garza said some stockists had sold out of hand sanitizer.  \n ($1 = 305.9200 naira) REUTERS"}, {"content": "what africa is doing to fight coronavirus.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) is not quick to declare global public health emergencies. \n From 2007 through 2019, the United Nations agency did so on only five occasions. The rapidly spreading new coronavirus that originated in December in China's Wuhan makes a sixth. \n The fallout from the organisation's Jan 30 call has spread rapidly. Four days later, the total number of countries placing border restrictions on Chinese travellers has surged to 60. They include Australia, India, Indonesia, Singapore, New Zealand, Russia and North Korea, and many countries have evacuated or are attempting to evacuate their citizens from Hubei province at the epidemic's epicentre. \n \"Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems\" than China's, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a tweet. \"I am declaring a public health emergency of international concern\u2026 not because of what is happening in China, but because of what is happening in other countries.\" \n The new coronavirus, known as 2019-nCoV, can lead to severe and often deadly pneumonia. Even as the number of infections and deaths rapidly mounted in Hubei's capital Wuhan and cases appeared in a growing number of other countries, the WHO took a deliberate approach to evaluating the danger. \n The agency's emergency committee, in meetings on Jan 22-23, initially decided not to designate it a global crisis pending collection of more data. A week later, the WHO declared the coronavirus the first global public health emergency originating in China. Such a designation did not apply to even the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) epidemic 17 years ago. \n A look at how the organisation reached its decision shows some of the inner workings of the global system for preventing and managing the spread of dangerous new diseases. \n The system relies on the rapid sharing of information among national health systems and the global public health organisation. Although some Chinese officials have drawn criticism internally and abroad for initially trying to downplay the crisis, the WHO's Dr Tedros maintains China was quick to share information, enhancing the global response. \n \"In many ways, China is setting a new standard for outbreak response,\" Dr Tedros said at a press conference. \"We would have seen many more cases outside China by now, and probably deaths, if not for the government's efforts.\" \n Data from China on the pathogen allowed Japan, South Korea and Thailand to diagnose similar cases quickly, he said. For example, a Chinese laboratory warned the German government of an infected person returning to Germany. \n Dr Tedros, an Ethiopian public health expert, arrived on Jan 27 in Beijing to meet Chinese officials. During his visit, President Xi Jinping called on the country to be transparent in working with the rest of the world and agreed to allow the WHO to send a group of international experts into the country to study the new strain of coronavirus alongside Chinese counterparts. \n Those data-gathering steps helped fill the information gap that kept the WHO's emergency panel from issuing its global warning sooner. \n Before the Jan 22-23 meetings, the lack of information on the virulence, infectiousness, severity and clinical symptoms of the coronavirus made reaching a consensus difficult, WHO emergency committee member John Mackenzie told media company Caixin. \n The global organisation had evidence of transmission of the virus within a household, but that is not unusual for a respiratory disease. The experts were looking for \"third-or fourth-generation infections\", referring to how many times a disease has been passed on, an indication of virulence. That evidence came quickly, laying the groundwork for the emergency committee to issue its global warning. \n Some argue that compared with the 2003 Sars crisis, the Chinese government has been much more transparent about the current coronavirus. \n \"Before we start pointing the finger at China, we need to recognise there are genuine sensitivities around sharing data around new diseases,\" said Dr Mike Ryan, director of the WHO's health emergencies programme who accompanied Dr Tedros to Beijing. \"I believe in this case the countries that have been affected, including China, have been remarkably transparent.\" \n According to US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, China's compliance with international health regulations and uploading of the genetic sequence of the virus enabled the Americans to develop a test kit to screen for infections. \n Under the WHO-administered International Health Regulations, a global public health emergency applies to \"an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response\". \n Since 2007, the WHO has declared public health emergencies in response to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the 2014 setbacks in global polio eradication efforts, the 2014 West Africa Ebola epidemic, the 2016 Zika virus outbreak and the 2018-2019 Kivu Ebola epidemic. \n The organisation's emergency committee, which makes the call, is made up of epidemiologists, virologists and infectious disease experts. Among them, at least one expert comes from the country where the epidemic began. \n The panel can also make recommendations to foreign governments on measures such as travel or trade restrictions. \n Even during serious crises, the WHO is conservative in its pronouncements. Through July last year, the Kivu Ebola epidemic killed 1,500 and infected more than 2,300 after appearing in the Democratic Republic of Congo in August 2018 and spread to nearby countries. The disease was not declared an international public health emergency until the WHO's fourth emergency committee meeting last July. \n Three factors weighed on the current WHO decision, according to Professor Didier Houssin, chairman of the WHO emergency committee. They were the rising number of cases in China, the growing number of countries with confirmed infections and the spread of questionable measures by some nations involving travellers. \n While the emergency committee does not encourage travel or trade restrictions, it acknowledges that such steps can be useful at times, such as when response capabilities are limited or when there is a large likelihood of infection among vulnerable groups. \n Under the International Health Regulations, countries are required to report travel restrictions to the WHO, and they are barred from taking steps that encourage discrimination. \n After news broke of the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, many countries imposed increasingly stringent measures. In addition to posting travel warnings and tightening border controls, several counties implemented preliminary screening measures using their own public health organisations to diagnose those who may have come into contact with the virus even before they showed symptoms. \n The United States reacted especially quickly. On Jan 17, four days after Thailand reported its first case, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said it would screen passengers arriving from Wuhan at major airports in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. At the time, the US had not reported any cases of the disease. After it did so, the country expanded screenings of Chinese passengers to 20 airports while also advising against all travel to China. \n Last Friday, the US declared the coronavirus epidemic a public health emergency and temporarily closed its borders to foreign nationals who had travelled to China in the previous two weeks and are not immediate family members of US citizens or permanent residents. The government also imposed mandatory two-week quarantines for those who were in China's Hubei province during that time span. \n As she confirmed Europe's first case of the coronavirus on Jan 24, French Health Minister Agnes Buzyn promised total transparency and daily updates to combat misinformation. She said sharing epidemic information with the public was the best barrier to its spread. \n Even though China shared the virus' genome sequence on Jan 11, researchers do not yet have a full grasp of its characteristics and routes of transmission, according to the WHO. \n Because developing a vaccine or treatment requires significant time and resources, all countries - including China and the US - should pool their efforts, said Dr Richard Hatchett, chief executive of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), an international epidemiology group. \n Cepi, made up of public and private entities, said on Jan 23 that it was funding research into three separate efforts to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus with the aim of shortening development time to several months. \n The US National Institutes of Health started research on vaccines after receiving the virus' genetic sequencing, Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN on Jan 20. He cautioned that the development process can last months or years, so controlling the epidemic will require \"traditional\" public health measures. \n So long as there is no vaccine, the only available measures for slowing the spread of the disease are quarantine, delaying resumption of work and schools and restricting travel, Dr Hatchett said last month at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He cautioned that the cost of these measures is high and difficult to sustain. \n From studying non-medical interventions in the 1980s, the US found that disease prevention is more effective when a city implements various interventions during the onset of an outbreak, Dr Hatchett said. \n As a US government public health official in 2005, Dr Hatchet helped draft the country's epidemic response plan in the light of the outbreak of the H5N1 influenza. \n \u2022 Xu Heqian, Wu Hongyuran, Qu Yunxu, Fu Lin, Zhang Qi, Chen Lixiong and Li Xin contributed to this article. \n \u2022 This article was first published by Caixin Global."}, {"content": "Global downturn looms as countries struggle to contain coronavirus outbreak.

KIRKLAND, Wash. - Doug Briggs put on a surgical gown, blue gloves and a powered respirator with a hood. He headed into the hospital room to see his mother - to tell her goodbye.  \n Briggs took his phone, sealed in a Ziplock bag, into the hospital room and cued up his mother's favourite songs. He put it next to her ear and noticed her wiggle, ever so slightly, to the music.  \n \"She knew I was there,\" Briggs recalled, smiling.  \n Between songs by Barbara Streisand and the Beatles, Briggs conference-called his aunts to let them speak to their sister one last time. \"I love you, and I'm sorry I'm not there with you. I hope the medicine they're giving you is making you more comfortable,\" said Meri Dreyfuss, one of her sisters.  \n Somewhere between \"Stand by Me\" and \"Here, There, and Everywhere,\" Barbara Dreyfuss passed away \u2013 her hand in her son's, clad in latex. It would be two days before doctors confirmed that she had succumbed to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.  \n Dreyfuss, 75, was the eighth U.S. patient to die in a pandemic that has now killed more than 1,200 nationally and nearly 25,000 worldwide. She was among three dozen deaths linked to the Life Care nursing home in Kirkland, Washington, the site of one of the first and deadliest U.S. outbreaks. (For interactive graphics tracking coronavirus in the United States and worldwide, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2Uj9ry0 and https://tmsnrt.rs/3akNaFr )  \n Dreyfuss's final hours illustrate the heartrending choices now facing families who are forced to strike a balance between staying safe and comforting their sick or dying loved ones. Some have been cut off from all contact with parents or spouses who die in isolation, while others have strained to provide comfort or to say their final goodbyes through windows or over the phone.  \n Just three days before his mother died, Briggs had been making weekend plans with her. Now, in his grief, he found himself glued to news reports and frustrated by the mixed messages and slow response from local, state and federal officials.  \n \"You find out all these things, of what they knew when,\" Briggs said.  \n Officials from Life Care Centers of America have said the facility responded the best it could to one of the worst crises ever to hit an eldercare facility, with many staffers stretched to the brink as others were sidelined with symptoms of the virus. As the first U.S. site hit with a major outbreak, the centre had few protocols for a response and little help from the outside amid national shortages of test kits and other supplies.  \n   \n 'NOT FEELING TOO GOOD'  \n A flower child of the 1960's, Dreyfuss lived a life characterized by art and activism. After marrying her high school sweetheart and giving birth to their son, she pursued a degree in women's studies at Cal State Long Beach, where she marched for women's equality and abortion rights.  \n Furious over President Gerald Ford's pardoning of former president Richard Nixon in 1974, Dreyfuss took to her typewriter and penned an angry letter to Ford. \"Today is my son's 9th birthday,\" she wrote of a young Briggs. \"I do not feel like celebrating.\"  \n By the time she arrived at the Life Care Center in May 2019, years of health issues had dimmed some of that spark, her son said. Fibromyalgia and plantar fasciitis restricted her to a walker or a wheelchair, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease required her to have a constant flow of oxygen.  \n When her son visited on Feb. 25, he brought a grocery bag of her favourites, including diet A&W root beer. She awoke from a nap and smiled at him, but hinted at her discomfort.  \n \"Hi Doug,\" she said. \"I'm not feeling too good.\"  \n Still, Dreyfuss talked about an upcoming visit with her sisters - the movies she wanted to see, the restaurants she wanted to try. The mother and son then had only a vague awareness of the deadly virus then ravaging China.  \n In hindsight, Briggs realized he had witnessed the first signs of her distress. His mother was using more oxygen than usual, her breathing was more strained.  \n At the time, staff at the nursing home believed they were handling a flu outbreak and were unaware the coronavirus had started to take hold, a spokesman has said.  \n   \n 'A TINY FOOTNOTE'  \n Two days later, Briggs dropped by to see his mom. She felt congested, and staff were going to X-ray her lungs for fluid. Briggs, 54, still saw no red flags, and continued to discuss weekend plans with his mother.  \n \"I hope we can finally watch that new Mr. Rogers movie,\" she told him, referring to the film, A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood.  \n Briggs hugged his mom before she was wheeled to the imaging room and drove for a quick meal. Soon after, he received a call from the nursing home. His mother was experiencing respiratory failure. She was on her way to the hospital. Doug rushed to nearby EvergreenHealth Medical Center. By then, she was unresponsive.  \n At the time, there were 59 U.S. cases of coronavirus, a number that has since soared to more than 85,000.  \n After hearing of her sister's sudden hospitalisation, Meri Dreyfuss remembered an earlier voicemail from Barbara: her distant voice, groaning for 30 seconds. When she had first heard it, she assumed Dreyfuss had called by accident, but now she realized her sister was in pain. \"It haunts me that I didn't pick up the phone,\" she said.  \n Briggs spent close to 10 hours the next day in his mom's hospital room. He wore a medical mask and anxiously watched her vital signs \u2013 especially the line tracking her oxygen saturation.  \n On his way out the door, a doctor took him aside to say they were testing her for the coronavirus. He remembered the difficulty reconciling the outbreak taking place on television - far away, in China - with what was happening in his mother's hospital room.  \n In the Bay Area, Meri and Hillary Dreyfuss were packing their suitcases on Feb. 28 when Briggs telephoned. After the call, they decided that visiting their sister would pose too much danger of infection.  \n \"I realized there was no way we were going to get on a plane at that point, because we couldn't see her,\" said the middle sister, Hillary. \"And now, it seemed that we shouldn't be seeing Doug, either.\"  \n They cancelled their flights. On Saturday, Feb. 29, Briggs learned his mother's condition was deteriorating. Tough decisions loomed. Briggs and his aunts decided to prioritise making her comfortable over keeping her alive. Doctors gave her morphine to relax the heaviness in her lungs.  \n She died the next day.  \n Having emerged from a two-week quarantine, Briggs will soon retrieve his mother's cremated remains. The family has been struggling with how to memorialize her life in such chaotic times.  \n \"All the things that one would want to happen in the normal mourning process have been subsumed by this larger crisis,\" said Hillary Dreyfuss. \"It's almost as though her death has become a tiny footnote in what's going on.\" REUTERS"}, {"content": "Coronavirus deaths eclipse global toll from Sars, but 'fewer unknowns' now about the virus. LONDON (BLOOMBERG) - The coronavirus disease spreading around the world has killed more than 810 people, exceeding the toll from the global outbreak of Sars that started in China almost two decades ago. \n Less than two months after surfacing in late December in Wuhan, China, cases of the coronavirus have topped 37,000. The fast-spreading disease long ago eclipsed the 8,100 total cases of Sars, which was transmitted worldwide in eight months, disrupting travel, industry and health care, and killing 774 people before coming under control. \n Both severe acute respiratory syndrome, or Sars, and the coronavirus are members of a larger family known to cause disease ranging from common colds to lethal infections. While both emerged from China before spreading to multiple countries, their paths have diverged in a number of significant ways. \n The rate of deaths among people infected with Sars was close to 10 per cent, said David Heymann, who oversaw the World Health Organization's (WHO) response to the outbreak, while it appears that rate in coronavirus will be below 2 per cent. An analysis of about 17,000 coronavirus patients showed that 82 per cent had mild cases, WHO officials said in a press briefing. \n \"You have to compare the two in perspective,\" Heymann said in an interview. The coronavirus outbreak \"could look more dramatic than it is.\" \n The number of cases and deaths from the new coronavirus may be far higher. The health system in Wuhan has been overwhelmed by the disease, with limited ability to care for every patient or diagnose new cases. Other cases may have been too mild to be counted by Chinese officials. \n \"I'm taking them for their word, but I really can't guarantee that they're reporting the right number. The only way you can guarantee it is if you go there and you monitor them,\" said Anthony S. Fauci, head of the US National Institute of Health's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. US officials have been trying to get a team into China to better study the outbreak. \n The epidemic of Sars began in 2002 with a report of mysterious pneumonia in southern China's province of Guangdong. It shifted into a higher gear when it was amplified in hospitals and then, carried by international travellers, spread to 26 countries. \n Hospital workers were at particularly high risk, as so-called super-spreading events sickened multiple doctors and nurses. The outbreak was finally controlled by July 2003 with improved infection-control procedures and the WHO's recommendations to limit travel to areas where the outbreak was still out of control. \n While Sars infected and killed hundreds of people outside China, the newer virus, known as 2019-nCoV, has been mostly confined to the mainland, with all but two of the known fatalities there. Even as China has been lauded for its quick action and open communication regarding the outbreak, a number of unknowns continue to heighten concern about the disease. \n \"When you don't know your enemy, the fear of your enemy grows,\" said Michael Ryan, executive director of WHO's emergencies programme, said on Friday at a press conference. \n Researchers still don't know exactly how the virus is spread. All signs point to droplet transmission, which means that small bits of fluid from the mouth and nose that carry the disease move from one person to the next, usually in face-to-face encounters. \n There's some evidence that people who aren't experiencing symptoms - coughing, sneezing, muscle pain - can also spread the virus. That means airport screeners, as well as patients themselves, stand little chance of finding infected people. Some researchers also think the disease might be spread through contaminated faeces, which was also the case with Sars and presents other prevention challenges. \n The severity of the coronavirus outbreak led to a lockdown of Wuhan city and Hubei province - with more than 58 million people - along with some other areas of China. The nation has become a virtual island as an increasing number of governments and airlines impose restrictions on travel from the mainland. \n The WHO hasn't recommended travel limits related to the coronavirus, but countries are desperately trying to keep the illness from their shores. Research on the new virus is moving quickly, and more may be known soon about how the disease spreads and how to stop it, Heymann said. \"There are already fewer and fewer unknowns,\" he said."}, {"content": "BASF expects coronavirus burdens. According to the world&#39;s largest chemical company, BASF, the new corona virus will have a significant impact on the global economy. &quot;This year we are already experiencing a high level of uncertainty in the global economy in the first two months,&quot; said BASF boss Martin Bruderm\u00fcller on Friday. With the virus, a new factor has been added that is putting a considerable strain on growth at the beginning of the year, especially in China. The consequences of the measures to counter the spread of the virus are lower demand and production losses in many industries, he said when the annual figures were presented. In the first and second quarters in particular, BASF expects negative effects. &quot;I warn against giving the all-clear too early just because the numbers of sick people in China are falling,&quot; emphasized Bruderm\u00fcller. He does not expect the coronavirus effects to be fully offset over the course of the year. For 2020 as a whole, the company boss anticipates that the global economy will grow significantly more slowly at two percent than in 2019. For global chemistry, too, he expects significantly lower growth of 1.2 percent. &quot;That would be by far the lowest growth since the 2008/2009 financial crisis,&quot; added Bruderm\u00fcller. &quot;If I had to overwrite that, I would throw our team down: Kneel down!&quot; Said the BASF boss. \u201cWe are now just doing our strategy, which is the right one. We cannot change the environment. But we can make the best of it. \u201dDue to the still uncertain consequences of the coronavirus, BASF has specified a wide range for the annual targets -\u201c That shows the uncertainty \u201d. Revenues are expected to rise to between EUR 60 billion and EUR 63 billion in 2020 - after EUR 59.3 billion last year. For the adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), the company is aiming for 4.2 billion euros to 4.8 billion euros - after a decrease of 28 percent to 4.5 billion euros in 2019. For 2019, BASF wants to give a little more money Distribute shareholders than expected. The dividend is to be increased by 10 cents to EUR 3.30 per share. In 2019, profit after taxes and minorities rose by almost 80 percent year-on-year to 8.4 billion euros. However, this included a book profit from the deconsolidation of the oil and gas subsidiary Wintershall in the amount of around 5.7 billion euros. &quot;2019 was a challenging year with strong global economic headwinds,&quot; said Bruderm\u00fcller. The trade conflicts between the USA and China had a negative effect, and important sales markets developed more slowly. In addition, there are uncertainties in connection with Brexit. The demand from many important customer industries has decreased significantly, especially from the automotive industry. In order to make the group more profitable, Bruderm\u00fcller, who has been in office for almost two years, set up an austerity program at the end of 2018. This includes job cuts. BASF has accelerated the austerity course, said Bruderm\u00fcller. The reduction of 6,000 jobs is now to be achieved by the end of 2020, a year earlier than planned. Last year, BASF cut 3,100 jobs worldwide. In return, BASF plans to invest 23.6 billion euros over the next five years. Last year, BASF merged its oil and gas subsidiary Wintershall with its competitor Dea. The company is scheduled to go public in Frankfurt in the second half of the year. &quot;We are preparing an IPO,&quot; said BASF CFO Hans-Ulrich Engel. Whether it then comes as planned, however, depends on the market conditions. The BASF majority stake Wintershall Dea is in focus because of the construction of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Wintershall Dea has a financial stake in the pipeline that is to transport gas directly from Russia via the Baltic Sea to Germany. The project is a thorn in the side of the US. That is why the companies that are helping to build the pipeline are threatened with sanctions. Construction is currently on hold. &quot;Alternatives for completing Nord Stream 2 are being considered,&quot; said Engel. After the construction freeze, Russia had set in motion a special ship for the laying of gas pipes. At the moment, the stop has no specific disadvantages for Wintershall Dea, said Engel. The pipeline is expected to be completed by the end of 2020. (dpa)"}, {"content": "Coronavirus effect on world economy grows more alarming.

The official explained that closing the borders is a difficult decision because it is necessary to assess the impact on the food supply to the territory and because it adds constraints to the daily routine of many Macau residents and many workers in the territory who live in China. \u201cWe are not closing any borders, they are not rushing to buy food. We have enough stock, don&#39;t worry\u201d, he assured. The official also appealed to the population not to leave home and \u201creduce as much as possible commercial activities\u201d. \u201cI can&#39;t have them shut down\u201d, he said, about the commercial spaces, but \u201cif they don&#39;t have customers, the retailers themselves will decide to close the business\u201d, he maintained. However, shortly afterwards there was a \u201crush\u201d to supermarkets. In at least six of these spaces on the island of Taipa, the scene was the same: corridors full of people, huge lines to pay, with people, masked, pushing shopping carts piled high with meat packages, canned goods , rice bags and water bottles. On the other hand, it was possible to see lines in the streets to enter spaces that sell frozen foods, which rivaled others that have been maintained for more than a week to purchase masks for rationed sales in pharmacies. The Government of Macau purchased a total of 20 million masks. Each resident, upon presentation of identification, receives ten masks for an equal number of days. As for disinfectants, exhausted in Macau, Ho Iat Seng said he will not use the same rationing method for the population. \u201cWe are not going to guarantee this type\u201d of product for the population, he said. The leader of the Macau Government revealed that the territory acquired masks in countries like the United States and Portugal, but, due to the coronavirus outbreak and the large amount of this medical equipment used in China, he is finding \u201cdifficulty in getting more masks on the market. external&quot;. \u201cAt this moment, Portugal no longer has masks,\u201d he said. Authorities said more than 2.9 million masks have been sold since the first case of infection in Macao was announced two weeks ago. As for disinfectants, which are also exhausted in Macau, Ho Iat Seng stressed that he will not use the same rationing method for the population. \u201cWe are not going to guarantee this type\u201d of product for the population, he stated. \u201cThe important thing is in hospitals and homes (...), these must be guaranteed\u201d, he stressed, adding that four tons of disinfectant products were purchased. \u201cThe priority is for medical workers (...), we do not want doctors and nurses to be infected\u201d, he reinforced. The press conference to publicize the exceptional measures took place on the day Macao announced that it had identified the tenth case of infection in the territory and admitted the possibility of a community outbreak, given the scenario of a case of local contamination. China has raised to 426 dead and more than 20,400 infected the balance of the country&#39;s pneumonia outbreak caused by a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) detected last December in Wuhan, capital of Hubei province (center), which has cities under quarantine, affecting an estimated 56 million people. Hong Kong announced the first coronavirus-related death this morning. The former British territory suspended maritime connections with Macau and closed almost all land and sea borders with the mainland to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. Only two border checkpoints, Shenzhen Bay and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao bridge, will remain open. In addition to mainland China and the Chinese regions of Macau and Hong Kong, there are more confirmed cases of infection in 24 countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared on Thursday a public health emergency situation of international scope, which presupposes the adoption of prevention and coordination measures on a global scale. The head of the Macau Government said this Tuesday that Portugal no longer has masks to sell to the territory, but assured that Macau has enough masks to sell to the territory. China, but for now only the temporary closure of the casinos has been decided, due to the new coronavirus. The first step is to suspend the activities of the casinos, \u201cthen we will analyze\u201d the situation and take the appropriate and necessary measures. The official said that the suspension of the casinos was a \u201cdifficult decision\u201d and that \u201cit will cause a lot of economic damage, but Macau is able to take on that risk\u201d.

Four more cases have been identified in a viral pneumonia outbreak in the central Chinese city of Wuhan that has killed two people and prompted countries as far away as the United States to take precautionary measures./nThe latest cases bring to 45 the number of people who have contracted the illness, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said Saturday. Five are in serious condition, two died and 15 have been discharged. The others are in stable condition./nThe cause of the pneumonia has been traced to a new type of coronavirus.

On March 24, while announcing a three-week preventive lockdown of the entire country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi allocated Rs 15,000 crore to boost the health infrastructure. The funds will be used to create additional hospital beds, build on the stockpile of COVID-19 testing kits and train medical practitioners. The Centre is putting in place protocols, including the acquisition of medical equipment and protection gear needed in the special isolation wards and facilities. A training protocol for frontline health workers is also being prepared.\nThe funds announced are a beginning. We would need more, depending on how soon we can end this affliction. Earlier, states were only using National Health Mission (NHM) funds. Now, they have access to a central fund, says Dr V.K. Paul, public health expert and a member of NITI Aayog. The first thing to do with the funds is equip hospitals, with personal protective gear, ventilators, additional oxygen, drugs and train staff. While isolation wards are being created, Dr Paul says COVID-specific facilities also need to be looked at for Stage 3. In Geneva, they are out of ICU (intensive care unit) beds. Such is the virulence of the disease at its peak. We need good hospitals that is where the focus is now. To support hospitals, we must also have isolation facilities, a strict surveillance system and should even consider setting up call centres in medical colleges, he says. Dr Paul maintains that India is still at Stage 2 (local transmission), but testing is being done more widely now.\nKerala, which has both an enduring healthcare system and a strong network of Panchayati raj bodies, is stealing a march on other states with its preparedness. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan says since a high number of people might need to be put under quarantine, local bodies have been instructed to identify hospitals, buildings, schools and auditoriums for the purpose. Even a minor lapse can prove disastrous, Vijayan cautioned office-bearers of local bodies during a video conference on March 19. If there is a spurt in cases, the existing facilities would not be enough to meet the requirements. Since the vast majority under observation would be home-quarantinedas people under special care\u2019, Kerala\u2019s strategy is to get the local bodies to take responsibility for local communities and ensure they do not face logistical problems while handling the situation.\n2 Dedicated COVID-19 hospitals and ICUs\nWith a hospital bed to population ratio of just 1:1,000 or around a million hospital beds in all, less than 100,000 ICU beds and only 40,000 ventilators at hand, India\u2019s healthcare infrastructure is ill-equipped to face a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases. Ventilators will be particularly critical. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), in a report, said that about 5 per cent of COVID-19 patients may require intensive care, and half of those may need ventilator support.\nCOVID-19 impacts the lungs. In severe cases, the lungs fill up with fluid and it becomes hard to breathe. A ventilator ensures that the lungs do not collapse while the treatment is on, says Dr J.V. Divatia of the department of anaesthesiology, critical care and pain at Mumbai\u2019s Tata Memorial Hospital. He warns of trouble if the patient numbers in India match those in China or Europe. There is no guideline on how many ventilators a hospital needs. In India, we keep about 20 per cent of beds for critical care, which is about enough in normal conditions, says Dr Divatia.\nMost high-end ventilators available in India are imported and cost Rs 5-12 lakh each. Hospitals say the quality of equipment made in the country isn\u2019t as reliable. If orders are placed in advance, more ventilators can be bought and set up within a week. With little demand for their products at home, Indian manufacturers have been exporting ventilators. Ventilators manufactured by the Delhi-based Croyox Medical Service, costing Rs 4 lakh each, have been exported to Nepal, Thailand and Europe previously. Things changed on March 19 with the government\u2019s ban on export of ventilators. It wants 100,000 simpler\u2019 ventilators, customised for COVID-19 patients, installed across the country by April 30. Mysuru-based Skanray Technologies is being tasked to make 5,000 of these. Low-end ventilators could be an alternative if the COVID-19 symptoms are not very severe, says Dr Divatia.\nVentilator parts such as valves and sensors, though, are expected to remain in short supply. We will share the knowhow with others ready to make these customised ventilators so that the demand can be met as soon as possible, says Vishwaprasad Alva, managing director, Skanray Technologies. Experts also underscore the need to ensure adequate oxygen supplies in hospitals; many hospitals in Europe struggled to save COVID-19 patients as oxygen supplies ran out.\nAcross states, properties are being identified to transform them into dedicated COVID-19 hospitals. These could be defunct or upcoming hospitals or even hostels of educational institutions that can be converted into 250-300-bed facilities. The first such facility is a 100-bed centre set up by the Sir H.N. Reliance Foundation Hospital, Mumbai, at the 700-bed SevenHills Hospital in Andheri. Anand Mahindra, chairman of the Mahindra Group, has pledged his Club Mahindra Resorts to serve as care centres for COVID-19 patients. He also said the group\u2019s manufacturing units will see if they can manufacture ventilators. Hyderabad\u2019s Owaisi Hospital and Research Centre is setting up an exclusive 100-bed centre.\nThe All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, which has about 1,300 doctors and 1,800 nurses on its rolls, has set up an isolation ward for COVID-19 cases. The institute has also freed up some 150 beds at its facilities in Jhajjar, Haryana. Regular meetings are being held to assess the situation and, on March 23, AIIMS suspended OPD (out-patient department) services as a precautionary measure.\nPlans for more isolation wards are being fine-tuned and will be reviewed by the ICMR in terms of protocol. This is among the steps being taken just in case the need arises, says Dr Indu Bhushan, CEO, National Health Authority (NHA). We are preparing ourselves should there be a [community-level] spread. That includes ensuring that private sector facilities support the treatment of COVID-19 cases. The NHA is assessing the capacity and readiness of private hospitals on this.\n3 Stimulus for domestic pharma\nThe abrupt stoppage in the flow of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), mostly from China, is impacting the Indian pharmaceutical sector, with fears now of a potential shortage of bulk drugs and intermediates. A corpus fund to incentivise Indian pharma companies is one way to encourage domestic production of APIs. The central department of pharmaceuticals has asked the Union ministry for environment, forest and climate change to waive the environmental impact assessment reports for projects by some categories of pharma firms. This, it is felt, will help reduce the time required to manufacture bulk drugs and APIs locally. The Centre has also pledged Rs 10,000 crore towards the production of critical drugs and another Rs 4,000 crore to promote manufacturing of medical equipment in the country.\nThe ICMR\u2019s announcement on March 23 that the antimalarial hydroxychloroquine could be used as a preventive drug by COVID-19 high-risk groups (health workers or household members of patients) has led to a scramble, with chemists reporting that stocks are running out. In Mumbai, most shops are out of stock. Doctors have been trying a combination of drugs, which worked for other infections, to treat COVID-19 symptoms. If this drug is proven to work, we would have a need for it, says Dr C.S. Pramesh, director, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai.\nFollowing US president Donald Trump\u2019s endorsement of hydroxychloroquine, Indian pharma companies Ipca and Zydus Cadila received bulk orders of the drug from the US. Even though India has a strong foothold in the production of hydroxychloroquine and pharma experts say production can be ramped up any time, there is already a noticeable shortage because of hoarding. While the government is planning to stockpile about 2 million doses of hydroxychloroquine, ensuring smooth supplies will also require a ban on its export, like the UK has done, as well as on over-the-counter sale.\n4 Reliable testing kits\nAs of 10 am, March 25, India had tested 22,928 samples for COVID-19, according to ICMR. This includes more than 500 random sample tests. The governing body for testing in India had come under fire for limiting the testing criteria in the initial days of the outbreak to those who had travelled to countries affected by the virus or had come in close contact with a COVID-19 patient. While about 300,000 test kits were available, only about 9,000 samples had been tested in the first week of March. Without data, it is hard to gauge the extent of the spread or make projections on the course the disease will take. Testing can slow down the disease, says K. Sujatha Rao, former Union health secretary.\nOn March 20, ICMR expanded the testing criteria to include even those who showed flu-like symptoms but had not travelled to countries reporting an outbreak of the disease. Two days later, it was announced that private labs would be granted licences for testing and orders would be placed with Indian companies to produce COVID-19 test kits. Private labs, however, say it is too early to comment on whether they can start testing since quality-compliant kits are not freely available. Also, the countrywide lockdown has crippled public transport, affecting staff strength in the labs.\nDr Navin Dang, founder of Dr Dang\u2019s Labs (one of the private facilities approved for testing), favours widespread testing. A few kits might be lost, but lives are also saved, he says. An ideal situation would be one like South Korea where mass testing is possible, where anyone with symptoms can be tested and isolated if needed. Dr Dang, however, discourages home tests. Self-assessment is not advisable as it is not reliable. The COVID-19 test has highly specific guidelines, nose and throat swabs are collected in protective packing and tested in labs with a biosafety level of 2 and above and a real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) system. Trained personnel are needed for it, he says.\nThe Centre has capped the pricing of the test at Rs 4,500 and urged private labs to conduct the test free of cost, if possible. It has also mandated that only US Food and Drug Administration and European CE certified test kits be used. Pune-based Mylab Discovery Solutions, the first home company to get commercial approval for manufacturing the test kits, has produced indigenous kits that give results faster (in 2.5 hours as opposed to the standard 7 hours) and are cheaper (the company wants to price it around Rs 1,500). While ICMR has ordered about 200,000 kits from Germany, MyLab claims it can produce that many in a week. Its test kits, though, are yet to acquire international certifications. For me, quality is everything and I will not start testing till the time I am able to procure high-quality test kits. We cannot afford misdiagnosis at this stage, says Dr Dang.\n5. Lessons from home-quarantine\nFrom a COVID-19 positive man in Telangana, who hosted 1,000 guests at his wedding, to a London-returnee in Kolkata who repeatedly evaded testing, to the wife of a COVID-19 patient who escaped from quarantine and boarded a train to Agra, India\u2019s fight against coronavirus is being thwarted by cases of individuals fleeing isolation. Who says COVID-19 cannot affect young people? It can. There have been severe symptoms in the youth too. Fewer, but it cannot be ruled out, says Dr Naresh Trehan, chairman and managing director, Medanta Hospital, Gurugram. Those who are old or immunocompromised are high-risk. Recovery is also slower for them. The lungs get damaged a bit in severe cases, and this can impact long-term cardiovascular health, though we don\u2019t know exactly how yet. Dr Trehan says that COVID-19 being a new disease, it is hard to predict who will get sick and in what manner. Those breaking quarantine because they feel they are going to get only mild symptoms and will be fine are wrong. They are putting everyone at risk.\nWhile states like Maharashtra are hand-stamping quarantined patients, to allow easy detection in case they step out in public, Kerala has adopted a home-quarantine model that relies more on community support than coercive measures. It is very difficult to convince people to stay at home for two weeks. We had been constantly contemplating how people could be dissuaded from breaking the rules of quarantine without having to punish\u2019 them, says Dr Amar Fettle, nodal officer for public health emergencies in Kerala\u2019s health department. The state has close to 53,000 people under home quarantine. Dr Fettle credits this to community outreach. We have 30,000 Accredited Social Health Activists and 15,000 field workers, who visit homes and educate people on the importance of isolation and social distancing, he says.\nThe state health department also makes surprise calls twice daily to check in on those in quarantine. The calls make note of the medical and other supplies they may be in need of, which are then arranged for through the primary health centres or panchayats. We realised that when you let people know that you are working with them, and not merely enforcing rules, they are more willing to listen, adds Dr Fettle. There are the odd defaulters in Kerala as well, but few.\n6. Defeating fake news\nAnother challenge is to curb the fake news circulating on COVID-19 and counter it with a credible information source. Telangana is rolling out one such digital solution to fight the misinformation. We are planning a WhatsApp number, on which people can get [COVID-19-related] messages verified, a website as well as an archive of fact-checked information, says Dileep Konatham, director, digital media, Telangana government. There have also been instances of misreporting by local electronic media, such as quarantined individuals undergoing tests being reported as new COVID-19 cases, only to retract the news within a few hours without even a hint of an apology. Determined to come down hard on such misinformation, Telangana has invoked Section 54 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, which stipulates imprisonment and fine for circulating false alarms/warnings\u2019 related to disasters.\nThe AIIMS staff has been among the victims of misinformation. On March 24, a circular from the hospital mentioned how members of its staff living on rent were being harassed or evicted by home-owners over fears that they would pass on the infection. Myths help COVID-19 spread. Doctors must be supported, not stigmatised, says Dr Randeep Guleria, director, AIIMS, adding that the pandemic is a daily evolving scenario. COVID-19 is a serious threat. Hospitals are taking steps to cope with the high numbers. The public needs to play a part too. If we are responsible today, it could stop the spread.\n7. Strengthening the healthcare force\nWith an estimated 0.62 doctors per thousand people, as opposed to the WHO ideal of 1 per thousand, India\u2019s healthcare sector looks acutely under-staffed in the fight against coronavirus. According to Dr Devi Prasad Shetty, founder of the Narayana Health chain of hospitals, round-the-clock treatment of 2,000 patients in an ICU would require an estimated 2,800 nurses, 800 resident doctors and 400 anaesthetists. At the time of community transmission in China\u2019s Wuhan (a city of 11 million), 9,689 patients were severe and needed to be admitted to an ICU. Going by Dr Shetty\u2019s estimate, attending to, say, 9,600 patients in Delhi (a city of 18 million) will require the services of 13,440 nurses and 3,840 doctors. Last year, it was reported that Delhi has 4,644 sanctioned (not necessarily filled) posts for doctors while the Delhi Nursing Council puts the number of registered nurses in the city at about 7,000.\nTo bridge the shortfall, Dr Shetty recommends that postgraduate students of medicine be given the option by their institutions to serve at COVID-19 ICUs and wards as part of their training. He also suggests that the Indian Nursing Council permit final-year nursing students to take care of stable\u2019 patients while young doctors trained overseas be given temporary licences to work under senior doctors in India. The government also needs to ensure the safety of healthcare workers. Doctors should be given personal protective equipment for practice runs and COVID-19 ICU simulations should be set up to teach them the safe practices, says Dr Shetty.\n8. A protocol for safe funerals\nIn Italy, mounting fatalities prompted the authorities to call in the army for safe disposal of bodies. As with other contagious diseases, there is a strict protocol in place for cremation/ burial of COVID-19 patients to minimise the risk of spreading infection. In India, in the absence of guidelines, there have been reports of crematoriums refusing to handle bodies of COVID-19 victims. In Delhi, the family of a woman who succumbed to the disease had to run from pillar to post for hours before the city\u2019s largest crematorium let in her body for the last rites. According to officials at Chennai\u2019s Kalyan Hospital, the role of the hospital ends with cleaning and securing a COVID-19 victim\u2019s body in a body bag, and the local administration needs to take over from thereon. A protocol that ensures the timely, hassle-free and respectful funeral of COVID-19 victims is urgently required.\n9. Ensuring the sick know what to do\nThe protocol for treatment in Germany bans hospital walk-ins. Those who feel they have symptoms are forced to stay at home, dial a number, which can take 40-50 minutes to connect, and wait for a doctor to call back to see whether or not their condition is serious enough to be treated. This has led to severe psychological stress for patients, many of whom have gone on social media to share their stories. To avoid such a situation in India, a clear guideline needs to be designed so that individuals with COVID-19 symptoms know what to do. Examples from Italy point to the fact that the infection spread a lot more through people-to-people contact in hospitals. Italian doctors have emphasised that COVID-19 should be treated at home as much as possible.\nGoa is creating an app that guides a person on the next steps to take based on a self-assessment of symptoms. But as cases rise, this may not be enough. Some projections point to 300,000 cases soon. If that happens, India would collapse, as would any country, says Rao. She is, however, hopeful that the situation will remain manageable. We are already one of the five countries to have isolated the virus strain. We should be coming up with a standardised procedure or guidelines soon. At this point, meticulous planning will save the day.

For all related coverage on the outbreak, click: here\nFor related Reuters graphics on the new coronavirus, click: tmsnrt.rs/2GVwIyw\nJapan is one of the worst affected of more than two dozen other countries and territories that have seen hundreds of infections from the flu-like sickness.\nThe Japanese woman fell ill in January but only later showed symptoms of pneumonia and was hospitalized, with coronavirus confirmed after her death and the contagion route under investigation, the health minister said.\nHowever, the big jump in China\u2019s reported cases reflects a decision by authorities there to reclassify a backlog of suspected cases by using patients\u2019 chest images, and is not necessarily the \u201ctip of an iceberg\u201d of a wider epidemic, a top World Health Organization official said on Thursday.\nMike Ryan, head of WHO\u2019s health emergencies program, said that more than 14,000 new cases reported in Hubei province overnight came after a change to include results from quicker computerized tomography (CT) scans that reveal lung infections, rather than relying just on laboratory tests to confirm cases.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this spike in the number of cases reported in China, but this does not represent a significant change in the trajectory of the outbreak,\u201d Ryan told a briefing in Geneva.\nThe biggest cluster of infections outside China is on a cruise liner now quarantined off a Japanese port and a further 44 cases were reported on board on Thursday, raising the total to 219. But authorities said some elderly people would finally to be allowed to disembark on Friday.\n\u201cOutside the cases on the Diamond Princess cruise ship we are not seeing a dramatic increase in transmission outside China,\u201d the WHO\u2019s Ryan said.\nHe added that the main U.N. health agency expected the rest of a special WHO team to arrive in China over the coming weekend to investigative the epicenter of the epidemic.\nU.S. President Donald Trump praised China over its response and said Washington was working closely with Beijing. \u201cI think they\u2019ve handled it professionally, and I think they\u2019re extremely capable,\u201d Trump said in a podcast broadcast on iHeart Radio.\nBut Trump\u2019s top White House economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, was more critical. \u201cWe\u2019re a little disappointed in the lack of transparency coming from the Chinese, these numbers are jumping around... there was some surprise,\u201d he told reporters.\nIn central China\u2019s Hubei province, officials said 242 people died on Wednesday, the biggest daily rise since the flu-like virus emerged in the provincial capital Wuhan in December.\nTotal deaths in China are 1,367.\nThe rise, following a forecast earlier this week by China\u2019s senior medical adviser that the epidemic might end there by April, halted a global stocks rally. [MKTS/GLOB]\nBut it appeared largely due to the change in methodology.\nHubei had previously only allowed infections to be confirmed by RNA tests, which can take days. RNA, or ribonucleic acid, carries genetic information allowing identification of viruses.\nBut it has also begun using CT scans of lungs, the Hubei health commission said, to pinpoint and isolate cases faster.\nAs a result, another 14,840 new cases were reported in the province on Thursday, up from 2,015 new cases nationwide a day earlier. But excluding cases confirmed using the new methods, the number of new cases rose by only 1,508.\nAbout 60,000 people have been infected in total, the vast majority of them in China.\nThe outbreak, believed to have emerged from a Wuhan market where wildlife was traded illegally, has triggered a backlash against local political leaders.\nProvincial Communist Party boss Jiang Chaoliang was fired as secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee, and Ma Guoqiang removed as party chief in Wuhan, state media said. They were the two highest-profile officials to be axed since the outbreak.\nChinese scientists are testing two antiviral drugs and preliminary results are weeks away, although WHO chiefs have cautioned a vaccine could take 18 months.\nWhile the Princess Diamond cruise liner remained in quarantine, another luxury liner, the MS Westerdam, was finally allowed to dock in Cambodia after being barred from Guam, Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand over fears that one of its 1,455 passengers and 802 crew might have the virus - even though none had tested positive.\nThe Westerdam\u2019s passengers clapped and cheered on their arrival at sunset."}, {"content": "a chinese director and 3 of his family members passed away after getting infected with covid-19.

The Cuban strategy to control and prevent the spread of Covid-19 was addressed on the afternoon of this Tuesday, March 17, on the television program Mesa Redonda, where the following were invited as panelists: \u2022 Dr. Francisco Dur\u00e1n Garc\u00eda, National Director of Epidemiology of MINSAP \u2022 Dr. Pablo Feal Ca\u00f1izares, Director of the Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention of MINSAP \u2022 Dr. Jorge Delgado Bustillo, Director of the Central Unit of the Cuban Medical Collaboration \u2022 Dra. Mar\u00eda Guadalupe Guzm\u00e1n Tirado, Head of the Center of Research, Diagnosis and Reference of the IPK Dr. Francisco Dur\u00e1n Garc\u00eda, national director of Epidemiology of the Ministry of Public Health (Minsap), updated on the most recent evolution in the world of the new coronavirus SARS CoV-2, the cause of the dangerous and contagious Covid-19 disease. Photo: Screenshot He expressed that since the first cases were detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019, the progression has been very rapid. He explained that the latest figures place the number of nations with at least one case at 144, and that there are more than 180,000 infected and more than 7,000 deaths, according to the latest data released on Tuesday. Dr. Dur\u00e1n Garc\u00eda highlighted China&#39;s effort to stop the virus and pointed out that outside of that country there are more than 98,000 infected with a mortality rate of 4%, higher than that registered in China at the most intense moment of the infection. Regarding the situation on the island, he confirmed the presence of two new cases of Covid-19 in Cuba, with which there are seven patients diagnosed with this disease. He pointed out that in almost all infections the characteristic that they have been through contact with an infected foreigner is maintained. \u201cWe cannot speak of transmission in the country, because that will happen when we begin to find people with the presence of the virus, with or without symptoms, who have not had a relationship with any of the infected patients from abroad or with links to them. We prepare for that situation, &quot;he said. It meant that in Cuba, since January the plan for the prevention and control of the epidemic was prepared and, since then, a group of actions has been carried out with the leadership of the main national authorities throughout the territory, since this disease requires of intersectorality. The National Director of Epidemiology of the Minsap added that this plan was incorporating knowledge in different clinical, epidemiological and treatment characteristics. In our country, there is the advantage of not having a land border and with good control, the risk of entering was minimized, because the person may be incubating the disease and it is not detected at the time of entry. From the beginning, the measure was adopted to isolate people with characteristics of this disease in the planned centers, which allowed to maintain a close surveillance of a number of almost 25 thousand people in primary care and anyone who came from the nations at risk of this pandemic. THEY REPORT TWO NEW CASES WITH COVID-19, FOR WHICH THERE ARE SEVEN THOSE CONTAGED IN CUBA He reported that today the laboratory of the Institute of Tropical Medicine (IPK) Pedro Kour\u00ed confirmed the diagnosis of the seventh case in Cuba, where almost all They have been people who have come from countries of transmission and two of them, who have had very close contacts with people from abroad. Regarding the quarantine, he specified that &quot;this measure is established in each country to the extent that its situation becomes more complex, not the international one.&quot; When the established measures are adopted and there is a group of cases that does not show the transmission of the disease, the quarantine is not justified, he clarified. In the same way, he explained that the closures of work centers and teachers create a situation of tension and stress, processes that are known to decrease the body&#39;s immune capacities and represent more risk. The country is aware of this and in recent days measures have been taken to avoid crowds, he said, WHY HAVE EXTREME MEASURES NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED IN CUBA? Commenting on why extreme measures such as quarantine have not been established in Cuba, he explained that this is assumed by each country depending on its characteristics. The World Health Organization establishes the measures in stages. The specialist reiterated that none of the cases detected in Cuba have been by transmission, but rather by having been infected abroad. \u201cThe quarantine is established depending on the transmission and at this time it is not justified. We work not to get to that moment, &quot;he said. He indicated that it is not prudent to close schools or work centers until there is transmission in the country. \u201cWhen there is no obvious transmission and you close schools, it creates extra stress and lowers immune capacity. Cuba is attentive and it has been made public that a group of activities with large population concentrations have been suspended, &quot;he stressed. CUBA AND ACUTE RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS Mar\u00eda Guadalupe Guzm\u00e1n Tirado, head of the Center for Research, Diagnosis and Reference of the IPK, referred to acute respiratory infections (ARI), in general, which, the specialist alleged, constitute the cause of death of three and five million people in the world, although this is also influenced by the misuse of antibiotics and other minor circumstances. \u00abThat is to say that they are known historically, we have faced this type of disease, which is mostly viral, and is sometimes accompanied by an inappropriate use of antibiotics, in addition to confusion due to the similarities of the symptoms, such as pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, etc \u00bb, he warned. He said that Cuba does not escape this reality, ARIs are the leading cause of death from infections in our country, but they are also a reason for hospitalization and in many cases of incorrect use of antibiotics, since most are viral, although bacterial infections are also they can produce them. They also generate school and work absenteeism. Among ARIs, she said, viruses occupy a leading place and cause a wide range of symptoms ranging from rhinitis, the common cold and those that affect the lower tract such as pneumonia, bronchopneumonia and bronchiolitis in young children. Different viruses can produce the same symptoms. In this regard, she stressed that we are talking about viruses such as influenza A, which shocked the world in 2009, influenza B, parainfluenza, enterovirus D68, among other emerging viruses, and also coronaviruses. MONITORING OF RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS BY THE CUBAN SYSTEM OF CUBANA The Head of the Center for Research, Diagnosis and Reference of the IPK pointed out that coronaviruses are a well-known viral group, identified in the 1930s, that affects many animals such as birds, bats , rabbits, horses, mice and pigs, producing respiratory and diarrhea symptoms, even neurological. In the 1960s, a group of coronaviruses was recognized, which affect man and become zoonoses. There are four fundamentals and all of them are monitored by Cuba. At this time, they are being monitored more proactively in the face of this global emergency, but the monitoring of viral and bacterial respiratory infections is daily in the national health system, she stressed. &quot;Personal care can only be done correctly by each person,&quot; she pointed out. Dr. Guzm\u00e1n Tirado explained that coronaviruses are \u201csoft, enveloped viruses, RNA viruses. It is because of these characteristics that there is so much talk about washing hands or using chlorine or alcohol as part of personal care to combat them, as they are susceptible to these solutions. \u201cPersonal care can only be done correctly by each person. When someone sneezes and is with a respiratory condition, we can become infected with any of the viruses, if we touch an entrance door such as the mouth, eyes or nose. \u201cHence the need for frequent hand washing. &quot;However, the coronavirus that emerged at the end of 2019 in Wuhan is new and it is already known that it has a high similarity with SARS isolated in bats, which are reservoirs of different viruses.&quot; She recalled that in 2009 the MERS took hold with a high mortality rate of between 30 and 35%, but located in the eastern Mediterranean area. In turn, in 2012, SARS had a 9% fatality rate in China and behaved as a serious condition. Regarding the new coronavirus, due to its similarity to the bat SARS virus, the IPK specialist explained that although it is possible that there is an intermediate host not yet recognized, it is very likely that it had its origin in bats. &quot;Because of its spicules, similar to a crown when observed through the electron microscope, it is called coronavirus.&quot; Photo: Screenshot CUBA HAS THE NECESSARY TECHNOLOGY TO PERFORM THE TEST THAT DETECTS COVID-19 For her part, Dr. Mar\u00eda Guadalupe Guzm\u00e1n Tirado, head of the Center for Research, Diagnosis and Reference of the IPK, explained that acute respiratory infections are a cause of between three to five million deaths in the world, and Cuba does not escape from that. They can cause a series of symptoms that vary according to the type, so that different viruses can produce the same symptoms. According to the specialist, this coronavirus is diagnosed through the nasopharyngeal exudate, a test that involves not cheap technology, which can cost up to $ 50 and that we have in the country, not only in the IPK, but also in Villa Clara and Santiago from Cuba. &quot;We also have the reagents, the specialized personnel, the laboratories, the equipment, etc ...&quot;, she said. Regarding the IPK, the doctor highlighted that it has three main functions: infectious disease research, specialized service, and teaching. This center assumes infected and suspected Covid-19 patients following the protocols of the WHO, the Chinese experience and the country&#39;s experience. In the case of teaching, the personnel of the Health System and other Cuban organizations, that is, from different sectors, have already been trained, as well as the trainers themselves who will be in charge of imparting the knowledge in other centers. Likewise, the exchange with scientists from other parts is maintained, as well as with international health organizations, not only for the confrontation of the coronavirus, but of other diseases. For this collaboration, the specialist thanked the solidarity towards Cuba. ABOUT THE DIAGNOSIS OF THE NEW CORONAVIRUS The diagnosis of this coronavirus is made through a nasopharyngeal exudate, which is where we find virus particles through advanced molecular techniques, which is known as real-time PCR, a technology used to identify different types of viruses. \u00abThey are modern and expensive methods. A real-time PSR test can cost between $ 40 and $ 50, she said. She added that this technology is available in the country, both in the IPK, and in three laboratories located in the provincial hygiene and epidemiology centers of Havana, Villa Clara and Santiago de Cuba. Photo: Screenshot FOR A CLOSER ATTENTION IN THE COMMUNITY Pablo Feal Ca\u00f1izares, director of the Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Unit (Prosalud), commented that in Cuba actions of the health system are carried out to protect people . He expressed that this plan is adapted to the health experience of the country and of others in the world. He said the family doctor&#39;s offices and polyclinics have been organized to provide closer care. The main ongoing task is the identification of vulnerable groups, such as people over 60 years old or with respiratory diseases, those who live alone and nursing homes. He argued that, in addition to the disinfection actions, the active investigation by the family doctor has been reinforced, giving priority to this group, and looking for respiratory symptoms with the aim of adopting immediate measures. The plan contemplates the certification of each process, he said, while explaining that after carrying out training actions throughout the country, now there is more specialized training. GO TO THE DOCTOR WITH ANY SYMPTOMS On the communication plan, Pablo Feal Ca\u00f1izares added that a greater participation of the population has been achieved. The national press media have provided timely, truthful information, insisting on the risk, but without creating panic. &quot;The fundamental thing is to convey confidence, security and the need for Cubans to protect themselves.&quot; At the same time, educational materials have been created that are transmitted by the media, while intersectoral participation increases. Each agency has a task, he pointed out. The specialist advised that before any respiratory symptoms, you should go to the doctor as soon as possible, as well as avoid leaving the country, and in case of traveling and returning, be checked by the health authorities. &quot;The most important thing is that Cubans maintain care, with responsibility and prudence,&quot; he said. Hand washing, he reiterated, is the most effective measure to prevent this disease. As for the Nasobucos, he called for the solidarity of Cubans, taking into account that they can be made in their own homes. &quot;Industrial production is focused on guaranteeing masks for personnel who are directly exposed to those infected or suspected, such as doctors.&quot; [if gte mso 9]&gt;<xml><w:WordDocument><w:View> Normal</w:View><w:Zoom>

As the death toll in China's novel coronavirus outbreak continues to rise, Congress's Rahul Gandhi has accused the Narendra Modi-led Centre of not taking the threat seriously.\n\"The coronavirus is an extremely serious threat to our people and our economy. My sense is the government is not taking this threat seriously,\" Rahul Gandhi wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. The former Congress chief also stressed the need to take timely action.\nHowever, Rahul Gandhi deleted his tweet sometime later and retweeted again with the same message.\nBJP IT cell head Amit Malviya responded to Rahul Gandhi's initial tweet pointing at the map Gandhi had attached with his tweet. \"Why would you repeatedly use a map which shows a mutilated J&K,\" he tweeted.\nIn India, three cases of coronavirus have been detected so far but there has been no casualty.\nWith the threat of novel coronavirus looming large, the Union Health Ministry earlier announced that it will stock up at least 50,000 personal protection equipment (PPE) kits for doctors and other medical staff treating the patients.\nThe move assumed significance as there could be a spurt in the demand for PPE, which includes disposable clothing, boots, masks and gloves, in case India witnesses an outbreak of the deadly coronavirus that has claimed more than 1,000 lives in China.\nIndia is among the top 30 countries at \"high-risk\" from the spread of the deadly coronavirus, according to a study based on the number of air travellers predicted to arrive in the countries from the worst-affected cities in China."}, {"content": "amid covid-19 outbreak, businesses have to consider diversifying their supply chains: chan chun sing. SINGAPORE \u2014 The Covid-19 situation is forcing businesses to think even harder about diversification \u2014 from making sure that their supply of labour comes from different countries, to housing their foreign workers in different dormitories, said Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing. \n His comments came after a two-hour dialogue with about 25 corporate leaders in Singapore on Friday (Feb 14), where they aired their concerns about the impact that the virus has had on their businesses. \n Mr Chan told reporters that the outbreak has mainly affected tourism-related sectors, the food and beverage sectors and the retail sectors but there are some sub-sectors that are still holding up pretty well. \n For other sectors, such as manufacturing, Mr Chan said the business leaders are not only concerned about the potential disruptions to the supply chain from China, but also the supply chains that come indirectly from China to the rest of the world and to Singapore. \n Business leaders also cited short term cash flow as being another concern, he said, although they added that they are taking steps to diversify their sources of supply chains and labour. \n He noted that because of the United States-China trade war last year, some companies had already begun undertaking measures to diversify their supply chains and it is likely that the Covid-19 outbreak will push more businesses to do the same. \n With regard to the supply of labour, Mr Chan said the business leaders agreed that there is a need to reassess where their manpower comes from so that they can avoid relying on a particular country for labour. \n However, Mr Chan added that the more pressing issue for local businesses is ensuring that their workers do not all stay in the same dormitories. \n \u201cSome of the companies, especially the smaller ones, might conveniently house their workers all at the same place. \n \u201cBut that is not a very resilient business continuity plan and I think we want to help many of these smaller companies to diversify their supply chain and mitigate these risks at the local level.\u201d \n To mitigate the problem of cash flow, Mr Chan said that business leaders can do their part by helping each other tide through the challenging times. \n \u201cThe larger contractors must not withhold payment from the smaller contractors, otherwise it will impact the entire ecosystem negatively,\u201d he said. \n Agreeing, Mr Ernie Koh, who is the executive director of furniture manufacturer Koda and an adviser to the Singapore Furniture Industries Council, said companies whose \u201cbalance sheets are strong\u201d and can pull through the current downturn should help support those who are struggling. \n \u201cI have always believed in supporting local businesses\u2026 Everyone has to stay afloat and with the big boys helping the small ones, we can all stay afloat (through this period),\u201d said Mr Koh, who was one of the representatives present at the closed-door meeting. \n BUSINESSES CONFIDENT OVER GOVERNMENT MEASURES  \n Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Mr Chan said he was also happy with the feedback from the business leaders that they are confident with the measures that have been taken by the Government to combat the outbreak. \n \u201cMany of them said they are assured that Singapore has expanded its surveillance regime to help detect more cases compared to some other countries who may not have been as rigorous in their detection and surveillance processes,\u201d he said. \n The business leaders also told Mr Chan that they were looking forward to \u201cposition themselves for the recovery\u201d and rebound from the ongoing crisis. \n To do so, the companies have taken advantage of the current situation to strengthen the training of their workers, review their current business models and production processes, said Mr Chan. \n \u201cI think this speaks very well for our business community that while they manage the current situation, they also have an eye for the future to make sure that we can be the fastest one to recover (from the crisis).\u201c \n Mr Alexander Melchers, vice-president of the Singapore National Employers Federation, said that after the Sars outbreak in 2003 was contained, the rebound for businesses was significant. \n That is why Mr Melchers, whose firm C Melchers Gmbh & Co is in the luxury goods business, has already started to make preparations for when the economy picks up again. \n \u201cI\u2019m telling my staff and the people that I work with to get ready for the upturn. There will be a rebound and we want to be ready for it. The staff needs to be there and they need to be skilled, ready and motivated,\u201d he said. \n MEASURES TO SUPPORT WORKERS TO BE ANNOUNCED DURING BUDGET 2020 \n When asked on how the Government will support businesses who are struggling during this period, Mr Chan said additional measures to support businesses and workers during this downturn will be announced on Tuesday in Budget 2020. \n The Budget Speech will be delivered by Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat in Parliament on Feb 18 at 3pm. \n Mr Chan added that the authorities have taken lessons from previous national crises such as the Sars outbreak, the global financial crisis and H1N1 when designing the measures. But since each crisis still has its own unique set of challenges, he cautioned that the measures will not necessarily be the same. \n \u201cSo while we can take a lesson from the past, we must also apply them in context,\u201d he said."}, {"content": "New coronavirus.

Certain mathematical models for simulating financial markets are similar to those for studying epidemics. \n We know this because we are two financial modellers who have been involved in modelling epidemics for public health authorities. \n Here, we would like to do our bit for public education on the Covid-19 outbreak by explaining five concepts from epidemiology, which is the study of how often diseases occur in different groups of people and why.\u00a0 \n The hope is that when the public is better able to understand what information about Covid-19 is shared, it will minimise irrational fear. \n KEY STATISTICS \n The media has been reporting on the number of newly infected and deaths cases daily. What is equally important is the number of recoveries, which is infrequently reported by the media. \n Imagine this: There are 10\u00a0newly infected and three deaths one day.\u00a0This sounds terrible, but if eight people recover on that day, then there is a net \u201cexit\u201d of one patient (3+8-10) from the pool. \n In any epidemic, perhaps the most important indicator is whether the net pool is increasing or decreasing. \n Another helpful statistic is the growth factor, which is each day's new cases divided by new cases from the previous day. \u00a0 \n The growth factor computed from total cases reported (worldwide) was mostly below one from Feb 13 to 19, but surged back to mostly above one from Feb 20 until now, as infections began spreading rapidly beyond China to other countries. \n Sophisticated models should also consider relevant country-level statistics, such as population, density, travel frequencies, medical resources available per capita and spare capacities in health systems to cope with infectious diseases.\u00a0 \n EPIDEMIC PYRAMID \n The typical classifications in an epidemic pyramid are death, severe, mild and asymptomatic, as follows:\u00a0 \n  \n Learning from their Sars outbreak experience in 2003, Singapore and Taiwan have resources and operating procedures in place to reach deep down the pyramid to trace every (asymptomatic) case possible even before symptoms are shown. \u00a0 \n But let\u2019s be realistic.\u00a0No matter how effective the screening process is, there will be misdiagnosis. \n Initial statistics collected from any outbreak almost always understate the full burden.\u00a0 \n For example, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention initially estimated 12,469 deaths for the H1N1 virus in the US from April 12, 2009 to April 10, 2010. But by 2019, it increased its estimate for that period to at least 75,000 deaths, or six times the earlier figure. \n Initial observed fatality statistics can be used to project the full burden with data that may take months or even years to arrive.\u00a0This is called a cross-sectional problem because we take one cross section of the pyramid to make an educated guess on the size of a deeper cross section of the pyramid.\u00a0 \n Case fatality rate is the number of deaths over a defined period of time divided by the number of individuals diagnosed with the disease during that time.\u00a0 \n This is a different problem by focusing on the time dimension. As long as epidemic models are careful in drawing conclusions from data already available at specific time points, they can still provide helpful insights. \n TOCC (TRAVEL, OCCUPATION, CONTACT, CLUSTER) TRACING \n Some countries may be too big in physical size. Many lack the resources to test and diagnose every suspected case.\u00a0 \n Moreover, many patients avoid seeking medical help until they show severe symptoms. As a result, we have to assume that a portion of undiagnosed patients may still be infecting others in the overall population.\u00a0 \n As long as there is a way to perform TOCC tracing from the diagnosed cases, there is a path to slow down the spread of infections.\u00a0 \n Public health officials worry the most about infections from unknown sources\u00a0\u2014 also known as the silent patients\u00a0\u2014 in which contacts cannot be back-traced easily.\u00a0 \n When the silent patients include say a taxi driver, he or she may have infected some passengers with no easy way to trace all related passengers riding his/her taxi.\u00a0 \n That is how epidemic control can become extremely challenging.\u00a0 \n Those were the worrying signs observed in the early stages in Wuhan and Hubei, and perhaps we are noticing similar patterns emerging in Japan, South Korea, Iran and Italy.\u00a0\u00a0 \n TREATMENTS \n From an epidemiological point of view, patients are removed from the pool by either recoveries or deaths.\u00a0 \n The human body does have natural mechanisms to rid itself of viruses including the Covid-19 virus, but that is not always successful before the onset of other fatal complications.\u00a0 \n Therefore, the medical goal is to increase recoveries by treatments and to decrease deaths. \n Certain treatments such as antibody therapy have been around since the 1970s.\u00a0The issues are what dosage to use for which types of patients, and whether there are any potential side effects.\u00a0 \n Safe vaccines may take many months to develop by clinical trials.\u00a0 \n In a public health emergency such as the outbreak in Wuhan, public health authorities may choose to bypass lengthy clinical trial procedures, but it is unwise if shortcuts are taken everywhere.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n EPIDEMIC MODELS \n Epidemiologists describe the dynamics of how a disease is spread with mathematical models to better predict the effectiveness of disease control measures using \u201cbefore and after\u201d analyses. \n Impactful epidemic models require: 1) reasonable and transparent data as model parameters, or the entire exercise will become \u201cgarbage in, garbage out\u201d; 2) a research environment where model results can be discussed openly to focus time and energy on the roughly correct models.\u00a0 \n There is a legitimate policy concern that raw data may be prone to misinterpretations by potentially faulty analyses, creating unnecessary fear among the public. \n Discussions among responsible scientists can take place in a \u201cmoderated\u201d but still expedited forum (such as on the medRxiv server co-hosted by Yale) to encourage participation and to minimise unnecessary overreactions to preliminary results. \n This way, \u201cscientifically credible\u201d clinical data can be released in a much shorter timeframe than the typical journal peer review process to allow other scientists to begin accessing the data, creating a win-win solution to address both scientific and public policy concerns. \n We encourage everyone with a good grasp of these concepts to review the primary sources instead of relying solely on secondary sources to interpret the statistics.\u00a0 \n For example, a recent report by the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre and the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London shows the estimates of the overall case fatality ratio in all infections (asymptomatic or symptomatic) of Covid-19 to be approximately 1 per cent.\u00a0 \n The confidence range is from 0.5 per cent to 4 per cent.\u00a0At the low end of the range or 0.5 per cent, Covid-19 is a low fatality but highly infectious disease like a terrible influenza, but public health officials may need to consider additional measures at the high end of the range or 4 per cent.\u00a0 \n Armed with better understanding of information shared, the public will be more prepared until effective vaccines and treatments become widely available.\u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n ABOUT THE AUTHORS: \n Anthony G\u00a0Constantinides is Professor of Communications and Signal Processing of the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering and heads the Financial Signal Processing Lab at Imperial College London.\u00a0Imperial alumnus Dr Bernard Lee is Founder and CEO of financial analytics firm HedgeSPA and author of Investment Analytics in the Dawn of Artificial Intelligence."}, {"content": "Anger is growing in China over how the coronavirus epidemic came to be. He was given the news on Wednesday at Wuhan&#39;s No. 4 Hospital. Her father-in-law had died, one of the more than 200 fatalities from the coronavirus that plagues that city. The individual whom a police report released Friday identifies as Ke could not contain himself. He pounced on two doctors and began beating them, ripping off their protective clothing. He is now in police custody. It is one more incident of many that these days reveal the public&#39;s fury around a crisis, the coronavirus epidemic, for which they blame the disastrous management of the local authorities of Wuhan and its province, Hubei. An epidemic that has already infected about 10,000 people and in which, despite increased supplies and the dispatch of thousands of additional doctors and health workers, hospitals are still lacking enough protective material and doctors and nurses are on the brink of death. exhaustion. The tension between the central government - willing to end the epidemic and the discontent of the oblation at all costs - and local authorities that want to avoid being held responsible for the chaos, is evident these days, in which the accusations of the one and the other side. And the lowest rung has the upper hand to lose. According to Southern Weekly magazine, 33 officials at the municipal or provincial level have already been dismissed, reprimanded or have had a file opened for mismanagement of the crisis. Added to the discomfort over the overflow in health centers has been the publication of a series of scientific information that corroborates the suspicions that key information was withheld from the public during the first weeks, while the problem became greater and greater in December and the greater part of January. A report by a large group of official Chinese experts, published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday, found, after examining the first 425 cases of infection in Wuhan, that human-to-human infections began to occur from mid-December. But the authorities insisted that there was no indication of this. It was finally admitted on January 20, when the spread of the epidemic began to skyrocket. \u201cTo say that I am furious is an understatement. I have no words \u201d, published on Weibo, the Chinese Twitter, the professor of Biology at Zhejiang University Wang Liming, after reading the report,\u201c it is the first solid proof that human-to-human infections were intentionally concealed \u201d. His message has since been deleted. Much of the anger is directed not against the central government - the consensus among the majority of the population is that things have improved since it has taken control of the crisis - but against the provincial authorities of Hubei and the mayor of Wuhan , Zhou Xianwang, a figure who seems to have his days in office numbered. The latest to lash out at him has been the chief epidemiologist at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Zeng Guang. In an interview with the state newspaper Global Times, he pointed out that the Wuhan municipal government may have been slow to respond to the crisis &quot;mainly due to the lack of scientific knowledge&quot; about the new type of coronavirus, but also due to &quot;some indecision in the taking measurements \u201d. During those vital first weeks, according to critics, Zhou was not only slow to provide information, but acted in a way that clearly helped spread the infection. At the beginning of January he organized a meal with 40,000 people to break a record of participation. And he insisted that people go on vacation for the lunar New Year: before the quarantine lockdown on the 23rd, five million people had left the city. He is also accused of having tried to suppress information. On January 1, the Wuhan Police announced that they had taken &quot;legal action&quot; against eight people suspected of &quot;spreading rumors&quot; - a charge that can carry up to seven years in prison - for reporting that those cases of strange disease that had been detected they looked like SARS. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which also originated in China and which killed almost 800 people worldwide in 2003, is caused by another coronavirus from the same family as the current one. This week, the Police have withdrawn the accusations against the eight, after the Supreme Court was very critical of the actions of that body. &quot;It would have been lucky if people had believed them (the &#39;rumors&#39;), and had started wearing masks and taking precautionary measures,&quot; he lamented. In a televised interview on Monday, Zhou acknowledged that his City Council did not release the necessary information as soon as he had it at hand and offered his resignation.

MONTREAL - The U.N.'s aviation agency on Friday approved restrictions for a global program designed to help airlines offset their carbon emissions, a move that curbs industry funding for older projects whose environmental benefits have been challenged by climate activists.  \n The International Civil Aviation Organization council approved recommendations to exclude offset projects begun before 2016 while delivering emission reductions through end-2020, ICAO said in a statement, confirming a report earlier in the day by Reuters.  \n ICAO cannot impose rules but sets standards approved by its 193 member countries. Its 36-member council was tasked with weighing which programs would be eligible under the venture for airlines, known as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).  \n The council's decision to accept credits from six programs for CORSIA's pilot phase from 2021-2023 came despite protests from Brazil, China and India, which wanted older projects to be eligible, said two sources who discussed the private talks on condition of anonymity.  \n Developing countries had hoped a global push by airlines to offset emissions would mop up a glut of carbon credits awarded under earlier climate initiatives.  \n One of the six programs is the United Nations' Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), the world's largest offset scheme set up under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to help fund emissions reductions in developing countries.  \n The fate of billions of older CDM credits, the majority of which come from China and India, was a thorny and unresolved issue for climate negotiators in Madrid in December, raising the stakes for ICAO.  \n ICAO was under pressure to strike a balance between approving enough credit options for airlines to purchase under the plan without squashing supply, which could push up prices.  \n Some environmentalists feared the council would approve weaker standards to help airlines hard-hit by the global outbreak of a coronavirus called COVID-19 that has led carriers to seek urgent government financial support.

Photo: Wong Pei Ting \n Then, there is Ms Bernalyn Jane Tay, a senior staff nurse with Tan Tock Seng Hospital\u2019s (TTSH) National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). She had just returned from her maternity leave in the first week of February when she was tasked with managing both suspected and confirmed Covid-19 cases.\u00a0 \n With the frontline staff\u2019s ongoing travel restrictions, the 31-year-old\u2019s original plans to breastfeed her first-born \u2014 now four months old \u2014 regularly had to be shelved as she could no longer make trips to send the pumped milk back to Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, where her baby is, as and when she wanted to. \n She had since obtained special permission from her bosses once a month to travel, see her baby, and send two weeks\u2019 supply of breast milk. But to make up for the rest of the month, her husband would have to make at least one trip to Singapore to get more milk from her. \n \u201cI really miss my child, but for his safety also, I don\u2019t want to always go back as I am currently nursing confirmed Covid-19 cases,\u201d said Ms Tay. \n Meanwhile, Dr Leong Choon Kit, 53, who runs Mission Medical Clinic in Serangoon, is keeping a distance of at least one metre from his loved ones, including his wife and teenage daughter. \n That means sleeping on a foldable mattress at night, while his wife takes the spot on the bed. And there are no hugs and kisses too, he added. \n Sacrifices such as these have become part and parcel of life for those working on the frontline in the fight against the highly contagious Covid-19 virus in Singapore, which has seen a total of 200 confirmed cases as of Friday (March 13). \n For more than a month now, frontline healthcare workers have been grappling with lost time with family members and disruptions to their personal routines and plans.\u00a0 \n Many have to endure working long hours under a plasticky nursing gown, goggles that could fog up, an N95 mask so snugly-fitted that it could cause a headache over prolonged use, a shower cap and gloves.\u00a0 \n They also have to deal with the mental strain of having to keep up with constantly changing standard operating protocols and definitions of suspect cases as the Covid-19 situation rapidly evolves. \n Dr Ng Wei Xiang, a senior doctor juggling duties between TTSH\u2019s Emergency Department and the NCID, told TODAY that they are at \u201cversion 43\u201d of their clinical protocol as of Thursday \u2014 just 50 days after the first Covid-19 case was announced here.\u00a0 \n In recognition of their invaluable role, along with the sacrifices that come with it, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat announced in Parliament on Feb 28 that public officers directly battling the disease will get a special bonus of up to one month, while a one-off Covid-19 grant will be given to 900 PHPCs, including more than 600 GP clinics, which had been activated to deal with the public health crisis.\u00a0 \n As Singaporeans adjust to living with Covid-19, TODAY spoke to some 20 frontline workers to get a glimpse of how their lives had been upended by the pandemic.\u00a0 \n  Ms Bernalyn Jane Tay, a senior staff nurse at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, makes a video call with her husband Jason Raj and son Ashton Raj, just after reaching home from a midnight shift at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. Photo: Bernalyn Jane Tay \n MITIGATING RISK IN THE FAMILY \n In the initial days of the outbreak, when alarming numbers of reported deaths from China dominated the news daily and struck fear in the hearts of many, Dr Leong could sense from chat groups that many of his peers in the GP community were \u201cvery stressed out\u201d.\u00a0 \n One Sunday in early February, Dr Leong, who doubles up as a leader of a primary care network under the Ministry of Health (MOH), got a call from a fellow GP.\u00a0 \n The caller asked Dr Leong to look after his young children should he die from the virus, and to explain to them how he died when they are older. \n \u201cIt is still early! Why are we talking about dying?\u201d Dr Leong remembered saying in reply. \n Dr Philip Koh, 54, a GP with a Healthway Medical branch in Tampines, said a young doctor had also shared with him that for the first time, he had told his father \u201cI love you\u201d, just in case he dies from Covid-19. \n While such anxiety has since subsided as more scientific information on\u00a0the virus emerges, some GPs today, especially those with young kids and elderly parents, remain adamant about not taking chances and\u00a0risking the lives of their loved ones. \n Among them is Dr Lee, a GP who goes beyond the MOH requirements to wear the full PPE for every single patient he sees.\u00a0 \n Inevitably, his outfit had attracted the attention of some of his patients, said the doctor who declined to give his full name.\u00a0 \n But the 35-year-old, who practises in an Aljunied clinic and works part-time as a locum, would explain to them that it is his way of protecting his two-year-old daughter who is also looked after by his parents who are entering their 70s.\u00a0 \n \u201cWhen I go to work, the first thing I care about is my daughter and my family. Although I care about my patients, my family comes first\u2026 I don\u2019t want to infect them. If an elderly gets it, it becomes bad and can turn into an ICU (Intensive Care Unit) case,\u201d said Dr Lee, whose wife is also a GP.\u00a0 \n Noting that some of his GP friends are voluntarily wearing full PPE as well, he added: \u201cIf you are a family man, you just have to take care of yourself and your own family first.\u201d \n  Dr Lee, a general practitioner, will not take a\u00a0chance on\u00a0dressing down when he sees patients walking through the clinic\u00a0daily, even if they declare that they do not have fever or flu symptoms. Photo courtesy of Dr Lee \n DEALING WITH PATIENTS WHO ARE NOT UPFRONT\u00a0 \n The full PPE is all the more necessary for him, as he had observed a trend of patients making false declarations that they had no respiratory symptoms at the front counter of the clinic, only to \u201cambush\u201d him by coming clean to him about their runny nose, sore throat or cough in the consultation room. \n Typically, a clinic following PHPC guidelines would have triage staff segregating patients who better fit Covid-19 suspect case definition from other patients to minimise any cross-transmission. The process also ensures that the GP could be forewarned to don the PPE before seeing higher-risk patients.\u00a0 \n Dr Lee got so irritated with such irresponsible behaviour that he decided to take a tally during a shift on March 5, and found that five out of the 20 patients he saw within a two-hour period were not upfront about their medical condition.\u00a0 \n \u201cIt beats me why they don\u2019t declare\u2026 They lie even when the triage staff warned them twice about the consequences of what might happen to them if they don\u2019t declare,\u201d said Dr Lee. \n \u201cI put my life on the line to help, so I am asking the public to be more socially responsible.\u201d \n MOH this week urged members of the public to be socially responsible as well, noting that despite its advisories against doctor-hopping, 38 of 160 Covid-19 cases had visited more than one GP clinic, and eight among them visited more than three GP clinics.\u00a0 \n Family doctor Jody Liu, father of three children aged four, seven, and nine, is also afraid of bringing the virus home and puts on an \u201calmost full PPE\u201d\u2014 goggles, an N95 mask and gloves \u2014 at work. \n But while the 38-year-old does not wear a disposable nursing gown, he has been making sure that he changes out of his work outfit before going home. And the first thing he would do back home is to head to the shower before his kids could touch him.\u00a0 \n For the time being, he has also stopped wearing a watch and stopped using his phone during his two shifts \u2014 from 8.30am to 2pm and 6pm to 9pm \u2014 to reduce surface contamination. He also comes to work about 15 minutes earlier to prepare for the day and leave about 15 minutes later to clean himself and his workstation, all of which adds up to an extra one hour for his double-shift work days that he could have spent with his kids. \n These are important measures as Dr Liu, who works at a PHPC, recognises that GPs like him may be called upon to assess people under the stay-home notice or home quarantine should they develop symptoms of the virus, such as fever, cough or breathlessness.\u00a0 \n \u201cWe are like the ministry\u2019s or the NCID\u2019s triage,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we suspect them, then they get to the hospital.\u201d \n MANPOWER SHORTAGES, FAMILY MEMBERS CHIPPING IN\u00a0 \n Dr Clarence Yeo, from Killiney Medical Clinic in the River Valley area, had been working almost daily since February. He believes this would be \u201cuseful for the patients\u201d, since MOH had advised that a patient should be reviewed by the same GP if they continued to develop symptoms after consulting one. \n The 47-year-old GP who sees an average of 50 to 60 patients daily \u2014 about half of them coming in with fever, flu or cough \u2014 said he will wait for the number of Covid-19 cases here to dwindle before considering taking leave. \n Asked when that might be, he said: \u201cIt is very hard to predict. We can\u2019t say the next month, May, or June.\u201d\u00a0 \n Regardless, he is ready to put in the hours for as long as the outbreak drags on. \n In his second televised address to the nation on the Covid-19 situation on March 12, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the outbreak \u201cwill continue for some time \u2014 a year, and maybe longer\u201d. \n Dr Alvina Nam, 52, who runs Clinic@Costa located in Bayshore\u2019s Costa Del Sol condominium, could not find a triage staff at short notice, so she enlisted the help of her 77-year-old mother and 49-year-old sister who were also eager to lend a hand. \n The two women now take turns manning a booth outside the clinic, which is on the PHPC network, to record the temperature of patients at the clinic and ask pertinent questions, such as whether they have any recent travel history over the last three weeks or if they possibly have had any contact with a confirmed Covid-19 case. \n  Dr Alvina Nam (right), a general practitioner, with her sister Ms Serena Nam (left) and mother Mrs Susan Nam, who help screen patients before they enter the clinic.\u00a0Photo: Nuria Ling/TODAY \n \u201cAm I subjecting them to possible virus infection? There is always a possibility\u2026 (but) they accept the risk,\u201d said Dr Nam. \n She added: \u201cMy mother is also old and not in the best of health. There is a small risk and certain fear, but they are generally understanding and want to pitch in during this time.\u201d \n Her sister, Ms Serena Nam, a teacher who left the workforce after giving birth to her son eight years ago, told TODAY: \u201cShe is my sister. It never occurred to me (to refuse to help). We are a very close-knit family.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 \n After all, she had dealt with bigger fears than contracting Covid-19.\u00a0 \n Ms Nam had been a resident in Hong Kong for 20 years but she recently returned to Singapore so that her son could continue schooling as protests roiled the Chinese city. \u201cAfter all that turmoil, you\u2019ll kind of say, okay, I will survive,\u201d she said. \n GPs are not the only ones who are struggling with staffing woes. Manpower shortages and extra shifts are also common at restructured hospitals.\u00a0 \n LIFE IN THE NCID\u00a0 \n TTSH\u2019s Dr Ng and assistant nurse clinician Ong Zh Hua gave TODAY a glimpse of what life is like in the NCID, which sees three in four of the nation\u2019s Covid-19 cases. \n They were originally part of TTSH\u2019s Emergency Department team which had screened the hospital\u2019s initial suspected cases since December, well before the NCID\u2019s screening centre was up and running by Jan 29. They now alternate shifts between the two departments.\u00a0 \n Dr Ng\u2019s most memorable shift took place on Feb 5, the day after MOH announced Singapore\u2019s first four cases of local transmission detected at Yong Thai Hang, a Chinese health products shop at Cavan Road in Lavender. \n It happened to be his very first shift at NCID and an unexpected crowd of 300 worried individuals flocked to the screening centre to get checked for Covid-19, after MOH said it would be getting in touch with people who had recent close contact with individuals with travel history to mainland China. \n Dr Ng was the only senior doctor rostered with five junior doctors then.\u00a0 \n \u201cThat was a very, very bad shift, but we survived because people came from all over to help,\u201d said the 33-year-old.\u00a0 \n  Dr Ng Wei Xiang, a doctor at Tan Tock Seng Hospital's Emergency Department. Photo: Nuria Ling/TODAY \n Before he knew it, manpower was diverted from the team manning the Emergency Department. Two consultants, two registrars and a few more doctors arrived to help at short notice. \n And not once did he sense anyone having the attitude of \u201cit is not my problem. I am not manning this post\u201d. \u201cThey asked if I needed help even before I asked for help,\u201d said Dr Ng. \n Still, he remembered having only \u201cbarely survived\u201d that shift. \n On other days, Dr Ng said he faced challenges such as being verbally abused by an unstable suspected Covid-19 patient who screamed at him and threatened to escape from the isolation area, prompting him to call for security back-up.\u00a0 \n To deal with the hospital\u2019s increased caseload, Dr Ng also had to work extra shifts, sacrificing time with his five-year-old son and wife, who is currently four months pregnant. His wife is a doctor at the National University Hospital. \n Ms Ong, 36, meanwhile, had to forgo two weeks\u2019 leave to train nurses who were seconded to work at the screening centre.\u00a0 \n She was supposed to spend Chinese New Year with her family in Sarawak, Malaysia, but ended up having to work on both the eve and the first day of the festival. \n Now that travel restrictions have been imposed on frontline workers, Ms Ng said she may have to cancel her plans to return to her hometown later this month for Qing Ming, the Chinese tomb-sweeping festival. \n A 23-year-old outbreak nurse at a hospital, who declined to be named, said that her busiest day entailed her and three other nurses having to settle 20 suspected Covid-19 case admissions during her 12-hour night shift, as a result of contact tracing efforts. \n Thankfully, two nurses were redeployed from other wards so they could finish their shift in time. \n She also noted having to deal with the psychological states of her patients, on top of managing their clinical needs. In one instance, she had to manage a suspected Covid-19 female patient who was listed as a high-suicide risk while being confined. \n \u201cSome of them were actually quite confident that they didn\u2019t have it and still wanted to go home as soon as the swab test was out,\u201d she said. \u201cSome who were tested positive might still be in a state of denial.\u201d \n  Ms Ong Zh Hua, an assistant nurse clinician at Tan Tock Seng Hospital who works in both the screening centre and emergency department, dons a full set of personal protective equipment. Photo: Nuria Ling/TODAY \n BEYOND N95-INFLICTED \u2018BATTLE SCARS\u2019\u00a0 \n Now imagine having to deal with all these work contingencies while running around covered by a humid, overheated \u201cshell\u201d\u2014 the full PPE \u2014 amid muggy weather this past fortnight.\u00a0 \n As Senior Staff Nurse Benjamin Ong, 29, from TTSH\u2019s Department of Emergency Medicine, had put it candidly in an Instagram post that went viral: \u201cLife as a frontline during this period isn\u2019t easy, to be honest it sucks. \n \u201cYou kiss your loved ones goodbye before heading to the \u2018war zone\u2019... Trust me, it isn\u2019t easy to breathe wearing any of those (N95 or powered air-purifying respirator), and with all that protection on, you work quick and fast, catching your breath with every step you make because life matters.\u201d \n He added: \u201cAfter finishing your shift sweaty with tiredness, aching back, sore calf, painful ankles, you found out that not only is your annual leave frozen, you are not even allowed to leave the country as a frontline staff.\u201d \n Indeed, the hospital frontline workers told TODAY it is common now to end their work day drenched in their own perspiration and dehydrated, as they were reluctant to drink more water, just in case they might need to \u201cdegown\u201d often for toilet breaks.\u00a0 \n Besides getting \u201cbattle scars\u201d\u2014 facial imprints, pressure sores, abrasions and even blisters on their nose bridge left behind by prolonged N95 use \u2014 some frontline workers are also getting pimple outbreaks. \n For TTSH nurse Ms Ong, wearing the N95 for more than four hours had led to pain at the point where the mask\u2019s strap cuts into the skin above the ear.\u00a0 \n Difficulty from breathing under it has also given her dizzy spells sometimes, while some of her colleagues had felt nauseous or even vomited as a result, Ms Ong said. \n Her sweat-drenched shirt from all the running around had also caused her to feel cold mid-shift, and she had adapted by making it a routine to change into another shirt during one of her breaks. \n During their mealtimes, they also have to observe social-distancing by sitting about two metres apart from one another.\u00a0 \n And they would have to be reminded to eat, with nurses taking turns to make sure that team-mates do not get so overwhelmed that they skip lunch.\u00a0 \n For Dr Ng, the constant use of alcohol-based hand rubs recently had caused eczema to flare up on his hands as they became dry and chapped. He had been aggressively applying steroid medication to reduce the inflammation and itch. \n  Dr Ng Wei Xiang, a doctor at Tan Tock Seng Hospital's Emergency Department, has blisters on his hands from daily use of disinfecting alcohol rub that dries out the skin. Photo: Nuria Ling/TODAY \n The full PPE had also made it difficult for co-workers at the screening centre to recognise who\u2019s who, he said. \u201cNurses didn\u2019t know where the doctors were.\u201d \n To get round the problem, the frontline workers had implemented coloured caps for easy identification. Senior doctors wear green caps, junior doctors blue caps, nurses white caps, while support staff wear red caps.\u00a0 \n At their \u201cgowning stations\u201d, there are also rows of duct tape so that workers could write their name prominently and stick it onto their gowns, Dr Ng said. \n Doctors and nurses also \u201cgown and de-gown our phones as well\u201d, Dr Ng said, referring to the practice of placing their clean phones in clear ziplock bags and disposing of the exposed bags in\u00a0the biohazardous waste bin, where they also dump their PPE. \n The process ensures that their mobile phone surfaces stay virus-free. \n Emergency nurses at private hospitals, such as Senior Staff Nurse Nicholas Zhu of Farrer Park Hospital, also have to don the full PPE over long hours as and when suspected Covid-19 cases are being held at an isolation area. \n The 34-year-old said his perspiration had caused his goggles to fog up slightly, but he would have to leave it on throughout his entire 12-hour shift on busier days.\u00a0 \n MORALE BOOSTERS \n With all the myriad of challenges, work days now seem to be longer for frontline healthcare workers.\u00a0 \n But Ms Capre Rena Joy Sobremisana, a senior staff nurse at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, noted how everyone has been pressing on. \n \u201cWhen duty calls, we drop everything, such as spending time with our family and friends. We tend to power through a busy shift even if our bodies tell us to sit down and have a rest,\u201d the 34-year-old told TODAY. \n  Dr Ng Wei Xiang, a senior doctor at Tan Tock Seng Hospital\u2019s emergency department, received this photo from his son\u2019s preschool teacher during one of his shifts. Photo courtesy of Ng Wei Xiang \n The long shifts get more bearable these days, thanks to morale boosters coming in the form of food, presents and \u201cthank you\u201d notes from members of the public \u2014 a marked change from before when some healthcare workers donning their uniforms found themselves being ostracised in public. \n The nurses and doctors said they are thankful for the chicken rice, nasi lemak, cookies, bubble tea, skin care products and flowers, among other things, that come their way.\u00a0 \n But the gifts that take away all their fatigue are usually the extra special ones from their families. \n For TTSH\u2019s Dr Ng, that pick-me-up came via a WhatsApp message during a hectic work day, sent to him from his son\u2019s preschool teacher. It was a photo of his five-year-old holding up a drawing paper on which he wrote: \u201cI love you.

Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that unlike the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak which lasted four months in Singapore in 2003, the current Covid-19 outbreak in Singapore is likely to continue for at least a year. \n He outlined some baseline things Singapore must get used to \u2014\u00a0such as practising good personal hygiene and social distancing \u2014\u00a0and how the country must plan for a possible spike in cases. \n Here, I would\u00a0like to elaborate on some key features of the Covid-19 pandemic that may be less well-known and what they mean\u00a0for how Singapore tackles the outbreak. \n First, we know that an infected person will typically transmit the Sars-CoV-2 virus (which causes Covid-19) to two to three close contacts, predominantly via droplet spread. \n What is less commonly known is the serial interval, defined as the duration between the onset of symptoms of an infected person and the symptom onset of the people he or she transmits the virus to. \n This is between four and six days for the coronavirus, longer than the serial interval of influenza (two to three days). \n Thus the spread of Sars-CoV-2 has been slower and less explosive than a pandemic influenza virus, which last emerged in 2009. \n This slightly longer serial interval provides more time for contact tracing and interventions such as the quarantining\u00a0of close contacts to break the chain of transmission. \n However, Covid-19 is characteristically mild during the first few days, and is virtually indistinguishable from an ordinary upper respiratory tract infection \u2014\u00a0upwards of 20 per cent of patients may not have fever at the start, but are nonetheless infectious. \n Of greater importance is that approximately 5 per cent of confirmed adult cases will require mechanical ventilatory support in an intensive care setting. \n The mortality rate was strikingly high in China\u2019s Wuhan and Italy\u2019s Lombardy because hospitals were overwhelmed and intensive care facilities were not available to many who required them. \n Secondly, there is no proven effective treatment for Covid-19 as yet, although more than 100 clinical trials are being launched. \n Several Sars-CoV-2 vaccine candidates have been developed. However, having a commercially available vaccine available in just over a year from now remains an optimistic estimate, even with expedited regulatory approval in view of the multiple safety and efficacy trials necessary. \n Thirdly, the contours of the epidemic have\u00a0changed substantially since the start of the year. China is no longer the epicentre of the outbreak after weeks of extraordinary efforts including the lockdown of Wuhan and several cities in Hubei. \n Iran and Italy, however, became secondary epicentres for the spread of the virus to the Middle East and Europe respectively, while struggling to cope with their own outsized local outbreaks. \n Cases have now increased dramatically worldwide, particularly in Europe and also the United States. \n In several low- and middle-income countries in Africa and Asia, the number of tests done and cases reported to date remain worryingly low. There is considerable uncertainty about the scale of the outbreak in these countries. \n This current state of affairs, where most territories are either at the ascending phase of their local outbreaks or where outbreak containment is beyond their means, is why Sars-CoV-2 will likely continue to spread around the world for the foreseeable future. \n It could even become an endemic virus like seasonal influenza or chickenpox. \n An effective vaccine will considerably ameliorate its impact in a way that is similar to measles and chickenpox, but it will not remove the threat entirely. \n In Singapore, current efforts have significantly contained the spread such that the healthcare system has not been overwhelmed despite occasional spikes of suspect and confirmed cases from different clusters. \n Nonetheless, the recent surge of cases worldwide contributed to an increase in imported cases over the past few days. Some citizens from neighbouring countries also came to Singapore with the express intent of seeking medical care. \n These developments led to the implementation of the most far-reaching travel restrictions in Singapore to date. \n But unless Singapore completely shuts its borders to the world for the duration of the pandemic, a drastic intervention that would\u00a0hugely impact the economy and all aspects of life here and which our political leaders have repeatedly stressed we cannot afford to do, there will be continued importation of cases. \n These have the potential to generate clusters of secondary cases, adding to the ongoing community spread already present within the country. \n This is not a cause for despair however, because we have been successful so far. But it does mean that long-term sustainability of control efforts becomes critical. \n From the perspective of the healthcare system, the key is to prevent any of its various components \u2014\u00a0primary care, acute and community hospitals, preventive services and so on \u2014\u00a0from being overwhelmed. \n This overwhelming of the system would not only result in eventual higher mortality from Covid-19, but would also have\u00a0negative knock-on effects on the care of virtually all other medical conditions including, for example, heart disease, diabetes mellitus and cancer. \n Singapore\u2019s current approach has been to minimise the risk for Sars-CoV-2 to spread in healthcare settings while creating capacity within the system. \n This includes: Heightened alert and screening at hospital and clinic entry points, delayed elective surgeries and outpatient follow-ups, as well as severely limited clinical\u00a0\u2014\u00a0especially bedside \u2014\u00a0training for undergraduate and postgraduate healthcare personnel. \n But this is an immediate adaptive response to the outbreak that is unsustainable in the medium term. \n This will need to be evaluated with consistent policies at the national level to alleviate stress in healthcare staff.\u00a0There is also a need to monitor the training of medical and nursing students\u00a0to ensure that the current disruption of training does not affect their clinical competency when they graduate over the next couple of years. \n Different measures to offload pressure on the healthcare system and build surge capacity are no doubt being considered. \n PM Lee for instance has noted that if Singapore sees very large number of cases, we will not be able to hospitalise and islolate every case like we do now. \n The sensible thing to do then is to hospitalise only the more serious cases and isolate the majority with mild symptoms in the community setting, including at home. \n The Government has already incrementally recommended targeted social distancing practices, including the recent suspension of social activities for senior citizens aimed at protecting this particular vulnerable group. \n Other measures could include expanding Covid-19 testing in primary care (or even at home), much like what South Korea has done, and expanding the role of telemedicine in general. \n Cross-training a segment of the Singapore Armed Forces Volunteer Corps and perhaps even full-time national servicemen to be able to use personal protective equipment and function as medical orderlies could be a radical but potential way of expanding the healthcare worker pool in preparation for a possible large surge of cases in the future. \n They should ideally not be taking care of Covid-19 cases, but could\u00a0help out in the care of patients with other diseases. Private hospitals can be co-opted for use for public sector non-Covid-19 patients as well. \n In conclusion, it is unlikely that the threat from Sars-CoV-2 will end in 2020, and may not entirely be dispelled even if an effective vaccine became available next year. \n Singapore has been successful in containing the epidemic to date, but will need to adapt further and implement innovative interventions in the healthcare system to ensure the sustainability of these efforts. \n \u00a0 \n ABOUT THE AUTHOR: \n Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang heads the Infectious Diseases Programme and is co-director of the Leadership Institute for Global Health Transformation at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore."}, {"content": "Stella Calloni: The coronavirus put the world between the dignities of solidarity and the miserability of a system that is dying. The coronavirus, a new strain of the existing one, whose mutation is being investigated, put the world between the dignities of solidarity and the miserability of a dying system, capable of using the effects of a pandemic to impose a state of terror on a global level and justify a crisis in the stock markets in the United States, Japan, Europe and others, while 37,000 soldiers are contradictorily concentrating to carry out a maneuver on European territory, violating quarantines and all measures to control the pandemic recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) . In addition to the severe accusations about the possibility that this virus has been produced in laboratories and spread in the precise center of China -to radiate throughout the country-, in Iran or Italy, at this time 20,000 soldiers are reaching several European countries Americans, who will join the 10,000 stationed at US military bases in Europe and another 7,000 provided by that region for a grand maneuver aimed at &quot;showing muscles&quot; to Russia and China. This arrival of troops for the &quot;Defend Europe 20&quot; maneuvers casts doubt on the effectiveness of the global quarantine and it is surprising that these exercises that involve the transfer of soldiers to the European front in similar circumstances have not been canceled. To this is added a media campaign as terrifying as the one that took place in the days after the attacks against the Twin Towers (2001), about which serious doubts remain both with regard to the alleged perpetrators of the event and the implosion effect that The mighty steel-based constructions collapsed so quickly. From a point of view of the use of biological warfare, which the United States has resorted to several times - not forgetting dengue hemorrhagic fever, swine fever and others used against Cuba - and which its Israeli partner supports, this could be the perfect An essay on how the Chinese giant that haunts the imperial power would react and how the world would act in the face of this situation, which is characterized by an &quot;uncontrollable&quot; virus but less lethal than the common epidemics of flu and pneumonia. For now, the powerful accuse the pandemic of their economic ills, but \u201cthe economy was already sick. The coronavirus is further proof that it is only maintained on the basis of continuous doping, &quot;says Eric Toussaint, a political scientist, professor at the universities of Li\u00e8ge and Paris, who heads the Committee for the Abolition of Illegitimate Debt ( CADTM). Toussaint carefully analyzed everything that happened in the stock market crashes of these large countries, especially since the last week of February 2020, the worst since the October 2008 crisis. \u201cAll the factors for a new financial crisis were and are present and together for several years, at least from 2017-2018. When the atmosphere is saturated with flammable materials, at any moment, a spark can cause a financial explosion. It is difficult to foresee where the spark may occur. The spark is like a detonator but it is not the root cause of the crisis. We still do not know if the sharp stock market crash of late February 2020 will &#39;degenerate&#39; into a huge financial crisis. But it is a real possibility, &quot;says Toussaint. He also warns that &quot;it is important to see where the crisis really comes from and not be fooled by the explanations that constitute a smokescreen before the real causes.&quot; Meanwhile, what is being seen in Europe is nothing more and nothing less than the unmasking of the destruction of the welfare system that, with its ups and downs, had been installed in those countries. There was a certainty - which never existed in our region - that this had been acquired forever. Nobody comments on the enormous embezzlement that the expenses in the colonial wars of this century meant for each of the European countries. From the beginning, the United States was clear with its partners in the North Atlantic Organization (NATO): &quot;We have the necessary weapons, but you must pay for it.&quot; How much Europe sacrificed to take charge of a war with invasions and occupation of countries with which it could negotiate and obtain products such as oil paid in euros, convenient for each other and in peace. The wars of colonial occupation against Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Yemen (both still ongoing), and others in preparation, have not only destroyed countries with the loss of millions of lives, humanitarian disasters, also destroying sites, cities that were patrimonies of humanity, cradles of civilization, violating all the rights of victimized nations and international laws, protected by scandalous impunity. These unilateral colonial wars have meant a tragedy for the peoples of Europe, victims in addition to neoliberal impositions. To pay for the sophisticated weapons and equipment of the latest technology, European governments may have used the almost 290,000 million euros that they stole from the Libyan state as jackals, since they were placed in collection in European banks before the United States blockade. The biggest &quot;winners&quot; in these high-crime colonial wars are arms and equipment manufacturers in the United States and Israel. Even American economists had warned that these wars, whose strategies were drawn on large maps in the halls of the Pentagon, were also destined to end the competitive capitalist bloc that could be the European Union. In addition to also signifying a &quot;war against the euro&quot;, defended tooth and nail by the German Angela Merkel, the most political capitalist ruler in Europe. At the end of the humanitarian disaster caused by the invasions and occupations, these wars left millions of desperate, hungry immigrants at the gates of Europe, without a home, without a country, without a country. One only has to look at the figures of international organizations before these brutal invasions to understand that in Libya or Syria the population had a standard of living sometimes higher than that of an ordinary European citizen. Fleeing the war, abandoned by international organizations, thousands of desperate people were swallowed by the sea or destined to live as abused beggars on the frontiers of horror. What did Europe gain from all this? Who is leading the occupation of those countries? Who appropriated the oil and other territorial wealth? THE VIRUS THAT PARALIZED THE WORLD Since early March, the Chinese Foreign Ministry maintains that the United States Army could have brought the coronavirus to the city of Wuhan, the city most affected by the outbreak, where in October 2019 these soldiers carried out military exercises. \u00abWhen did patient zero start in the United States? How many people are infected? What are the hospitals called? It could be the US Army that brought the epidemic to Wuhan, &quot;says a message written on Twitter on March 9 by the spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Zhao Lijian. On his side, Philip Giraldi, a former agent of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), interviewed by Hispan TV affirmed that his country could have created this virus as a weapon of war to harm China and Iran. In the case of Italy, several analysts remarked that this is the first European country to sign so many important agreements with China, which angered Washington. For its part, the Iranian military also denounced that several studies show that it is possible that COVID-19 is a new strategy and form of war by the United States and allies against their enemies to &quot;generate deaths, destabilization and instability.&quot; The international analyst Jos\u00e9 Jofr\u00e9 Leal warned that these are not &quot;new strategies and new forms of war&quot;, since, according to research and studies, this pandemic combines &quot;elements of conventional warfare, irregular warfare, biological warfare and Cyberwar&quot;. He also referred to the statements of the leader of the Islamic revolution in Iran, Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei, who ordered to mobilize to face a biological war on the hypothesis that the COVID-19 outbreak is an attack of this type, arguing that States United would be using the new coronavirus as a biological weapon. &quot;Above all, the Chinese themselves have admitted the possibility that US troops have incorporated the coronavirus into China,&quot; said this expert in reference to the maneuvers they carried out in Wuhan. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States, publicly admitted on March 11 that some Americans, who apparently died of influenza, tested positive for the new coronavirus in the diagnosis final. In the same way, the spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mar\u00eda Zarajova, considered the accusations of the United States to Russia by the coronavirus as &quot;deliberately false&quot;, recalling that the Secretary of Commerce of that country, Wilbur Ross, said in Last February to the Chinese newspaper Global Times that he saw the virus as &quot;an opportunity&quot;, since it could help the recovery of jobs in the United States in the middle of the trade war that Washington has with Beijing. In this same environment, the WHO issued a warning that the times to eradicate the coronavirus are shortened, which became a pandemic -not so much because of the mortality figures, lower than seasonal flu and pneumonia-, but because of the amount of affected countries, expressing especially concern about the cases that occurred in Italy that do not have a &quot;clear epidemiological link&quot; with what happened in China. In this framework of multiple situations, the system&#39;s media hide truths, and in the face of a humanitarian tragedy they do not hesitate to manipulate the information and also use it as weapons of a blind war. Among so many shadows, from a small island in the Caribbean, such as Cuba, despite being blocked by the greatest power in the world (the United States), the medicines that have made possible the control of this disease in China, associated with the Cuban government to produce medicines in a large Chinese laboratory. While the ultra-right and coup governments in Latin America have deprived their populations of the only medicine they have received throughout their lives from the hands of self-sacrificing Cuban doctors, as has happened in Brazil, Bolivia and elsewhere, condemning the peoples to neglect in health, Italy asked the Cuban government for medical help. These are the lights and shadows of a moment of extreme fragility that the world is experiencing and in which it is evident that solidarity is the greatest antidote, but also the certainty that we cannot allow war to continue, which we know It means the end for humanity.

The great helmsman swam on July 16, 1966 in the waters of the river that bathes Wuham, accompanied by bodyguards, to show that at 73 years of age he was in top physical shape. It is considered the greatest act of political propaganda in the People&#39;s Republic of China. Images of the country&#39;s founding father, historical leader of the Chinese Communist Party, founder of Maoism, ran around the world. Mao Tse-Tung had his summer residence in Wuham, the capital of the Hunan province where he was born, in the poor village of Shaoshan, 400 kilometers away, where the leader is still worshiped today. The occasion is celebrated every year, thousands of Mao worshipers enter the Yangtze, but the city that bathes is no longer the same, it has become a mecca of Chinese-style capitalism, torn by skyscrapers, populated by western chain stores clothing, fast-food, attended by thousands of students from one of the largest Chinese universities and home to production units for the major brands in the automobile industry, which already earned him a comparison with Detroit, before the decline of the American city . Thousands of migrants live there who work in the large units of General Motors, Honda, Nissan, PSA and Renault, as well as in the Chinese Dongfeng (partner and shareholder of PSA) and SAIC (partner of GM), which employs 6,000 people. But it was in the traditional unhealthy hustle of the market - which was about to be closed last year and which sells fish, shellfish and birds, but also exotic animals for human consumption, from hedgehogs to live crocodiles - that vendors and visitors to the space were identified. pneumonia, later reported to the World Health Organization on the last day of last year. A week later, in 2020, a new Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified that put the city under quarantine and spread the alarm through Mao&#39;s birthplace province, later infecting the rest of the world, first with the cut of several international air connections to prevent the virus from traveling. Still, a few days after the alarm there were more than six thousand cases across central China, one hundred and a half deaths, and the record of cases in Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and other Asian countries, but also in Australia, in the States United States, South America and Europe. 15 million people were expected to pass through Wuham during the Chinese New Year&#39;s mini-vacation period - perhaps many could have gone a few kilometers north to the Panlongcheng archaeological site, which dates back to the Shang dynasty, between 1600 and 1046 BC Spending entertainment and transportation, according to S&amp;P Global, are expected to drop 10 percent because of the Coronavirus. Historic city Wuhan has more inhabitants than Portugal. Around 11 million people live there, despite all this is a small number by Chinese standards: it is only the seventh most populous city in China when classified by population of the urban area. But Wuhan is vitally important to the country&#39;s economic health - situated at the confluence of the Yangtze River and its largest tributary, the 1500-kilometre-long Han River, is an important communication and distribution center for all of central China and also for the main economic partners. From there, the river, air and rail transport networks that play a part in the growth of the second largest economy in the world follow. The region&#39;s economic, political and commercial hub is often referred to as the &#39;China way&#39; and economists predict that the impact on China&#39;s Gross Domestic Product of the partial quarantine imposed by Coronavirus will be at least one percent - if the emergency doesn&#39;t it is perpetuated far beyond the Chinese New Year celebrations, on January 25th, whose traditional holiday this year was celebrated with a protective mask on the face or at home, as imposed by the authorities. In 2019, Wuhan&#39;s GDP growth was 7.8 percent, 1.7 percentage points above the national average. The total value of imports and exports reached 244 billion yuan (about 40 billion euros), a record that was 13.7 percent above the previous year and represented 61.9 percent of the total value of foreign trade of the province. More than 300 of the 500 largest companies in the world are present in the city, including Microsoft. In recent years, Wuhan has invested to become a high-tech center, especially for the optical industry. Yet its reputation as China&#39;s &#39;automobile city&#39; has never faded, its impact as a major logistical center greatly influences China&#39;s economic health of what it briefly became the capital on two occasions - in 1927 and again during the terrible Second Sino-Japanese War, in 1937. But already in 1911 Wuham had marked the history of that great country, when it was the scene of the so-called Wuchang Revolt, which overthrew the last imperial dynasty. Fifteen years later, troops commanded by Chiang Kai-shek conquered the city, giving breath to control of the territory through the alliance between his Kuomintang (KMT) and the Communist Party, which already covered the entire southeast of the country. But Wuhan was also a symbol of the division between the KMT and the communists. The war with Japan, which invaded China as part of its expansionist plans even before World War II, ended Chiang Kai-shek&#39;s attempts to unify the country. Faced with the Japanese advance, the KMT government was forced to abandon the capital, Nanjing, retreating to Wuhan and, later, to the remote city of Chongqing. In July 1967, at the height of the Cultural Revolution, the so-called &#39;Wuhan incident&#39; occurred: an armed conflict between two groups fighting for control of the city. The two opposing forces were the &#39;Million Heroes&#39; and the &#39;Wuhan Workers Headquarters&#39;. The first comprised 500,000 people, mainly skilled workers, civil servants and the party, and was supported by the commander of the Wuhan Military Region, General Chen Zaidao. The &#39;General Headquarters&#39;, with many other supporters, was made up of workers and students from the Red Guard. They engaged in a propaganda war to gain support from the local community - Mao was chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and had already swam in the waters of the Yangtze. Twelve days later, on July 28, 1966, representatives of the Red Guards wrote to Mao, calling for rebellion and revolt to carry out the Cultural Revolution. Many people accused of being counterrevolutionaries were forced to commit suicide. During the &#39;Red August&#39; 1966, 1772 people were killed in Beijing alone. In Shanghai, there were 704 suicides and 534 deaths related to the Cultural Revolution in September. In Wuhan there were 62 suicides and 32 murders.

However, in some provinces such as Guangdong up to 14 per cent of the discharged patients had reportedly returned to hospital because of the test results. \n If it turns out that these patients had been reinfected by the same virus, then vaccines will not prove effective. \n But the monkey experiment carried out by a team from the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences may help dispel that fear. \n Details of the experiment were made available last Saturday (March 14) on bioRxiv, a website for studies pending peer review. \n Professor Qin Chuan wrote that his research team infected four rhesus monkeys with the Covid-19 strain and the animals started to show signs of sickness three days later. \n They developed a fever, started struggling to breath and lost their appetite and weight. \n On the seventh day of the experiment, Prof Qin euthanised one of the monkeys and found the virus had spread throughout its body from nose to bladder with visible damage to the lung tissues. \n The remaining monkeys, however, recovered gradually and eventually stopped showing symptoms. \n About a month later, after tests returned negative results and X-rays showed their internal organs had fully recovered, two monkeys were dosed with the virus through the mouth. \n The scientists recorded a temporary temperature rise, but other than that everything appeared to stay normal. \n Autopsies were performed on these two monkeys about two weeks later, and the researchers could not find a trace of the virus in their body. \n Meanwhile, very high antibody levels were detected after the second week, suggesting that the immune system was prepared to fight the disease. \n Prof Qin said the results would have \u201cimportant implications in evaluating vaccine development\u201d. \n The researchers argued that the positive test on some recovered patients may be down to some other cause rather than the patients becoming reinfected. \n \u201cIt may be attributed to \u2018false negative\u2019\u2026 test results before their discharge or the patients not making a full recovery even though they meet the criteria for a discharge,\u201d they wrote. \n The animal experiment supports observations made by some doctors on the front line in the fight against the disease. \n Professor Zhong Nanshan, a leading government scientist, said in Guangzhou last week that they had found a strong presence of antibodies in recovered patients, which meant the virus could no longer use them as a carrier again. \n \u201cNow the question everyone cares about is whether the close contacts and family members may be infected because (the patient) tested positive again. So far I have not seen any evidence,\u201d Zhong said. \n Nonetheless, the government has taken precautions. From March 5, all patients discharged from hospitals need to stay in a quarantine facility for another two weeks. \n A doctor, who works at a public hospital in Beijing looking after Covid-19 patients, said the experiment provided valuable information because monkeys are genetically close to humans but \u201cwhat happens on monkeys does not always work on us\u201d. \n The doctor also said that a recent case in Japan has caused \u201csome concerns in medical circles\u201d after the health authorities reported that a 70-year-old patient who had recovered was hospitalised again for developing Covid-19 symptoms such as fever and difficulty breathing. \n In a separate experiment involving three monkeys, Prof Qin and colleagues also found evidence to suggest people could be infected through the eyes. \n Dr Wang Guangfa, a senior medical expert from Beijing, was infected after a trip to Wuhan to investigate the early outbreak despite wearing a face mask and other protective gear. \n Dr Wang suspected that the virus entered into his body through the eyes as he wiped sweat from his forehead, but had no evidence to support the theory. \n He later recovered at home in Beijing with relatively mild symptoms. \n To verify the theory, Prof Qin and colleagues dropped a solution containing the virus into two monkeys\u2019 eyes. \n To their surprise, the researchers did not find the virus on the surface of the monkeys\u2019 eyes the next day. But several days later, both animals tested positive. \n Further investigations showed that the viral strain might have landed on the conjunctiva, a tissue lining the inside of the eyelids and covering the white of the eye, and then travelled through the tear duct before ending up in the upper throat. \n However, the infection suffered by the monkeys appeared to be less severe than that of another animal that had caught the virus through the throat, according to another paper posted by Prof Qin on bioRxiv last Saturday. \n According to several other recent studies, the new coronavirus can survive in the air or on metal surfaces for days. \n The scientists wrote that their findings suggested that people should be more aware of the need to protect their eyes. \n They argued transmission could be cut by \u201cregular hand-washing in daily life and wearing protective eyewear when in close contact with patients or in crowded places, especially for clinicians\u201d. SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST"}, {"content": "China's controversial quarantine measures worked, prominent epidemiologist argues. BEIJING (CAIXIN GLOBAL) - China's controversial quarantine measures limited the size of the country's Covid-19 outbreak and should be kept in place until late April, according to a study by a prominent Chinese epidemiologist. \n The study, led by Dr Zhong Nanshan, who has spearheaded China's effort against Covid-19, was published last month in China's Journal of Thoracic Disease, of which he is editor-in-chief. It defended various measures taken by China since late January to control the spread of the virus, including citywide lockdowns, forced quarantines and shutdowns of public transportation. \n Critics have charged that these moves were ineffective, violate the rights of individuals, and were too late to materialise after the discovery of the virus, and initial efforts to warn the public of its danger were suppressed. \n Yet Dr Zhong argued that these measures managed to quickly reduce the number of new cases. The study said that they also cut both the number of peak \"active infections,\" which refers to the number of people ill at the height of a region's epidemic, and the predicted total number of infections by the end of the epidemic. \n Nevertheless, at a Feb 27 press conference in Guangzhou, South China's Guangdong province, Dr Zhong said that the paper had been rejected by at least one \"authoritative\" overseas medical journal, though he did not say which or why. \n Using a version of the \"susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered\" mathematical modelling technique, the study predicted that with the quarantine measures in force at the time of its publication, the epidemic in China would peak on Feb 28 with 59,764 cumulative active infections, dwindle by late April and result in about 122,122 cases in total by the end of the epidemic. \n This contrasts with modelling done by overseas infectious disease experts, with one study estimating the country's Covid-19 cases would reach 160,000 by early February. While Dr Zhong's figures more closely match China's official case numbers, Caixin has previously reported that the official tally excludes a significant portion of people who have tested positive for Covid-19, namely those without symptoms. \n According to Dr Zhong's team, a five-day delay in implementing the country's various lockdowns would have tripled the total number of infections in the country. Taken five days earlier, the measures would have cut the number of cases nationwide by two-thirds. \n Meanwhile the paper predicted that infections in Hubei, the province hardest hit by the outbreak, would peak on Feb 20 at 42,792 cases, then grow to a total of 59,578 by late April, when the outbreak is expected to near its end. \n Had interventions been delayed, both Hubei's active infections and total cases would have been over 2.6 times the current projected amount. Had the interventions been introduced five days earlier, the epidemic peak should have arrived five days earlier, with the total case number not exceeding 25,000. \n The study argues that if Hubei had ended its restrictions on movement after the extended Chinese New Year holiday concluded in early February, the province would have had a second peak in infections in March. \n The authors found similar trends for Guangdong and Zhejiang, two other provinces hit hard by the virus. \n \"The continued policy of 'early detection' and subsequent isolation might be effective in preventing a second epidemic wave in Guangdong and Zhejiang,\" the study said. \n The paper cautions that the return of migrants to Chinese cities, broadened testing and climate factors could affect the number of cases and that \"the policy of strict monitoring and early detection should remain in place until the end of April 2020.\" \n This story was originally published by Caixin Global."}, {"content": "US summons Chinese envoy over coronavirus comments. WASHINGTON \u2022 The US State Department summoned the Chinese ambassador to the United States last Friday to protest against Beijing's comments suggesting the US military might have brought the new coronavirus to Wuhan, as tensions between the two global powers over the outbreak intensified. \n Mr David Stillwell, the top US diplomat for East Asia, delivered a \"stern representation\" to China's Ambassador Cui Tiankai, a State Department official said, adding that Mr Cui was \"very defensive\". \n The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said China was seeking to deflect criticism of its role in \"starting a global pandemic and not telling the world\". \"Spreading conspiracy theories is dangerous and ridiculous. We wanted to put the government on notice we won't tolerate it for the good of the Chinese people and the world.\" \n United States Defence Department spokesman Alyssa Farah wrote on Twitter last Friday that \"the Communist Party of China has chosen to promulgate false & absurd conspiracy theories about the origin of Covid-19 blaming US service members. #ChinaPropaganda\". \n The Chinese Embassy did not respond to requests for comment. \n Despite the tension, US President Donald Trump last Friday praised Beijing for its \"data sharing\". Asked by a reporter during a White House news conference about \"odd narratives\" being offered by some Chinese officials, Mr Trump appeared to brush off any concern, saying he had read one article on the subject, but that he did not think it was representative of his discussions with Chinese President Xi Jinping. \n Mr Trump, who last week called the outbreak a \"foreign virus\" started in China, added: \"They know where it came from, we all know where it came from.\" \n Tensions escalated after Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian took to Twitter last Thursday: \"When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!\" \n Mr Zhao's comments came days after Mr Robert O'Brien, the US national security adviser, said China had reacted slowly to the coronavirus, probably costing the world two months when it could have been preparing. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has also complained that the US response had been hindered by what he called imperfect data from Beijing. \n The coronavirus, which emerged in China in December, has spread around the world, hitting financial markets, bringing some flights to a standstill, closing schools and forcing the postponement of many major events. \n REUTERS"}, {"content": "Persons holding a Portuguese passport held on a cruise \u201care not at special risk\u201d.

Nine years ago, US director Steven Soderbergh released the disaster film with stars like Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Winslet and Marion Cotillard. Due to the coronavirus crisis, the factually staged thriller is suddenly in high demand again on streaming services. What was enthralling entertainment in 2011 now has a bitter aftertaste. The Covid-19 pandemic with the rapidly increasing number of infected and dead people shows more and more parallels with catastrophe scenarios \u201cMade in Hollywood\u201d. And the coronavirus is now scaring the entertainment industry. Hollywood darling Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson were the first celebrity couple to surprise with the news that they are both infected with Sars-CoV-2. The entertainment business is virtually paralyzed. Film and TV productions will be stopped, cinema releases canceled worldwide, trade fairs and festivals canceled. Industry experts anticipate box office losses of up to $ 20 billion this year if the stalemate extends over several months.

In the last few days there have been other blockbusters: &quot;Fast &amp; Furious 9&quot;, &quot;The New Mutants&quot;, &quot;Mulan&quot;, &quot;Peter Rabbit 2&quot;, &quot;A Quiet Place 2&quot;. Fans now have to wait longer until these films come to the cinema. John Krasinski, director of the horror film &quot;A Quiet Place 2&quot;, commented on the delay on Instagram. You should experience his film together with other people in the cinema. &quot;Now is obviously not the time.&quot; After China, Italy and Poland, more and more movie theaters are also closing in other countries. In the US, most cinemas will remain open for the time being, but they will only give out half of the tickets to create more space and thus more distance between the visitors. The Hollywood studios are implementing the recommendation of \u201csocial distancing\u201d, ie keeping a distance from one another in order to avoid contagion, radically. The Disney studio announced a massive filming stop on Friday, thus avoiding encounters on the set. Major projects such as \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d, Guillermo del Toro&#39;s \u201cNightmare Alley\u201d and Ridley Scott&#39;s historical drama \u201cThe Last Duel\u201d with Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are affected. As a precaution, the streaming service Netflix wants to suspend the production of films and TV shows in the USA and Canada for at least two weeks. The positive coronavirus test at Tom Hanks had led to the immediate termination of director Baz Luhrmann&#39;s new production on the set in Australia. The biopic from Studio Warner Bros. is a still untitled biopic about rock and roll legend Elvis Presley, in which Hanks plays his manager Colonel Tom Parker.

The box office could miss $ 20 billion this year, especially if the lucrative foreign markets collapse, reported the Hollywood Reporter on Friday. In 2019, more than 42 billion dollars flowed into Hollywood&#39;s coffers worldwide. The annual CinemaCon trade fair, at which the movie theater industry wanted to present the latest Hollywood projects in Las Vegas at the end of March, has also been canceled. The renowned Tribeca Film Festival in New York and the International Film Festival in San Francisco (both scheduled for April) have also been canceled. These are bad harbingers for Cannes, where the 73rd film festival is (still) on the agenda in mid-May. A rejection would have a hard time affecting the already ailing international industry.

GENEVA/DUBAI - All countries need to prepare to combat the coronavirus, the World Health Organization said on Thursday, as authorities raced to contain the epidemic's rapid global spread and Wall Street looked set for its biggest weekly fall since the 2008-2009 financial crisis.  \n With new infections reported around the world now surpassing those in mainland China, World Health Organization (WHO) Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said even rich nations should prepare.  \n \"No country should assume it won't get cases, that would be a fatal mistake, quite literally,\" Tedros said, pointing to Italy, where 17 people have died in Europe's worst outbreak.  \n In addition to stockpiling medical supplies, governments ordered schools shut and cancelled big gatherings, including sports events, to try to halt spread of the flu-like disease known as COVID-19 that emerged in central China more than two months ago from an illegal wildlife market.  \n The death rate appears to be around 2 percent, although it could be lower if there are many mild, undiagnosed cases, experts say.  \n By comparison, seasonal influenza has a case fatality rate of around 0.1%, said Anthony Fauci, Director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, ahead of a meeting with Vice President Mike Pence, who has been put in charge of coordinating the U.S. response.  \n \"So therefore you have somewhat of a serious potential for morbidity and mortality,\" he said, adding, \"We're dealing with a serious virus.\"  \n There is particular concern over a case in Japan in which a woman tested positive for the virus for a second time.

It has spread to another 46 countries, where around 3,700 cases and 57 deaths have been reported.  \n \"This virus has pandemic potential,\" Tedros told reporters in Geneva.

Much has been said about the 'perils' of Work From Home during the novel coronavirus pandemic. Yes, it is unbearable, in all honesty. Everybody is so done with life and sorry for making it worse, but we are just in the second day of the 21-day nationwide lockdown in India. But let's get this straight. There is really no other option at the moment. However, we can tell you something that might cheer you up even in this grim period.\nYou've read about Survival Of The Fittest enough and it is time to implement it now. Why? Because we have to survive this pandemic without any sort of help. For those living alone, especially. It is taxing because there is literally no help. You need to fend for your food, clean the house and do other chores after completing your shift. On the flipside though, did you ever think about the amount of money that you are saving while cribbing about the lockdown?\nThe silver lining, thus, on this cloud, is that if not anything else, you will walk out of this pandemic with some extra bucks in your bank account once the corona conundrum is done with.\nFor the sake of your sanity (and ours as well), we curated this list that will help you ascertain a rough estimate of the amount of money you are saving at the moment.\nTake a look:\nNO ZOMATO, NO SWIGGY\nYes, this is the worst thing about the lockdown. Not being able to order food online. Basically, coronavirus has ensured that even in this distressing situation, you cannot afford to feel bad for yourself and soothe your soul with some biryani, pizza or tandoori chicken for that matter. You just have to make do with ready-to-eat jazz or better still, cook for yourself. But thanks to Zomato and Swiggy stalling operations, you cannot even believe the amount of money you are saving. Come on, you know it. Till then, enjoy simple home-cooked food and you can gorge on Swiggy and Zomato once we are done with the pandemic.\nNO ONLINE SHOPPING\nWe understand it's frustrating not being able to shop online considering some people actually keep a part of their earnings aside every month to do this. None of the e-commerce websites are delivering stuff but look at the brighter side of the story. You can use all the money that you had kept aside to shop tons of stuff once services resume. Think about the fact that you will not have to choose between the white shirt or that red lipstick - you can actually just buy both without batting an eyelid.\nNO CONVEYANCE EXPENSES\nCab aggregators Uber and Ola have suspended their services and public transport isn't available as well. Moreover, you are working from home and aren't even stepping out for recreation. So, no expenses for conveyance either. Make no mistake, because you are saving big time here.\nNO RECREATIONAL EXPENSES\nWhen was the last time you opened your wardrobe and wore a fancy dress for an outing? Well, the answer should explain that our only outing has been from the bedroom to the kitchen and vice-versa and that too, in our pyjamas. No partying with friends. No shopping at malls or indulging in delectable dishes at restaurants. Nothing, actually. Right now, it is all about you and your tanhai, and not to forget, kaafi saara paisa in the bank account.\nBEST USE OF RESOURCES\nIn order to avoid stepping out, it is ideal to make do with what you have. Everybody is basically making the best use of their resources, and although grocery stores are open, you are reconsidering heading out until absolutely necessary. With that, you are actually cutting out on a lot of unnecessary expenses. Do the math.\nSo, don't be surprised with your increased bank balance. Celebrate yourself, instead, for pulling off this major challenge with ultimate ease. But, hold on, only after we emerge victorious following the pandemic.\nThe novel coronavirus pandemic has intensified rapidly across the world ever since it was reported in China's Wuhan in December 2019.

Singapore, a tiny city-state of less than 6 million people, had one of the earliest and biggest clusters of cases of the coronavirus in early February, before it began its rapid, inexorable expansion around the globe.\nWithin weeks, the country's tally of infections with the highly contagious virus that causes COVID-19 was overtaken by skyrocketing caseloads in South Korea, several European countries and the U.S.\nSome strategies are proving more effective than others in containing the pandemic: pro-active efforts to track down and isolate the infected, access to basic, affordable public health care, and clear, reassuring messaging from leaders. East Asia's experience with the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which also originated in China, has likewise helped.\nSince testing rates vary widely, it's hard to know for sure. But Singapore appears to be among the handful of places that tick all those boxes, though recent spikes in new cases show that any lapses can have dire consequences.\nSingapore's first case, confirmed on Jan. 23, was a 66-year-old man from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the disease was first detected in late December.\nBy mid-February, the number of recovered patients in the Southeast Asian city-state was outpacing new ones. That changed in early March after 47 cases were tracked to a Feb. 15 dinner gathering. As of Wednesday, Singapore had 266 confirmed cases and no deaths from the virus.\nAs new infections increased, the government tightened quarantine controls.\nTaiwan, a self-governed island off the coast of mainland China, has confirmed just 77 cases and one death. Most recent cases were residents returning from overseas travel.\nHong Kong has reported 167 cases and four deaths. Its leader, Carrie Lam, on Tuesday warned against all outbound travel and said any people arriving from outside greater China will face 14-day home quarantines or medical surveillance.\nOf the 13 cases found in the tiny gambling enclave of Macao, 10 have recovered. Casinos have been closed for weeks to battle the outbreak.\nCambodia, which has confirmed a dozen cases, last weekend moved to stop foreigners traveling from France, the U.S., Spain, Germany, Italy and Iran after several new cases were found among travelers.\nThailand, likewise, appears to have kept cases under control with aggressive public health campaigns intended to minimize infections, though new cases jumped recently as stepped-up testing found clusters linked to a boxing tournament and an evening gathering at a bar. So far, 177 cases have been confirmed among 70 million Thais, even though it's a top destination for travelers, especially from China.\nAssuming the numbers reported to the World Health Organization are accurate, many of the countries with lower caseloads are relatively isolated geographically: Singapore, New Zealand, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Mongolia. Some others may be latecomers in testing and reporting: Russia, Indonesia, Vietnam.\nFor Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong, the experience of battling the 2003 SARS outbreak, which infected some 8,000 people and killed nearly 800, helped ensure residents took the risks seriously, experts say.\n\"Almost everyone played ball and followed accordingly,\" said Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases specialist at Singapore's Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. \"SARS was our baptism by fire and we were forced to learn everything by swimming in the deep end of the pool.\"\nAfter the SARS outbreak, when 238 people were infected and 33 died in Singapore, the city revamped its already excellent health care system, writing up new protocols for containing outbreaks. It set up \"fever centers\" to isolate suspected cases, invested in equipment and improved training in handling infectious diseases, Leong said. So when the first case of COVID-19 was discovered, Singapore was ready to act, he said.\nFrom Feb. 1, Singapore blocked entry and transit for new visitors who had traveled to mainland China within 14 days. These restrictions have since expanded to include visitors with recent travel to Iran, northern Italy or South Korea.\nWhen the number of local cases without links to previous cases or travel in China surged, the government raised its alert to \"orange,\" the second-highest level, on Feb. 7. The Singapore Air Show, a huge event that draws thousands, scaled back the number of participants and barred most exhibitors and visitors from China from attending. Good hygiene and avoiding handshakes were recommended.\nThe National Public Health Laboratory, set up after SARS, was prepared to fast-track testing, using advanced diagnostics and newly developed COVID-19 test kits.\nRapid testing and isolation of suspected cases, and painstaking tracing of contacts, helped by police, surveillance videos and ATM records, have helped prevent a worse local outbreak, said Tikki Pangestu, a visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and former director of WHO's research policy and cooperation department.\nOnce a COVID-19 case is confirmed, Singapore embarks on \"diligent contract tracing,\" said Pangestu. It ordered workers arriving from countries with endemic virus infections to stay home. Worship services were suspended in favor of livestreaming after a cluster was found at a church. Schools suspended mass assemblies and staggered recess.\nSo far, 5,700 people have been quarantined.\nIn Thailand, too, public health workers have gone door-to-door to track down contacts, said Thanarak Plipat, deputy director-general of the Disease Control Department of the Health Ministry. \"We must go see them ourselves. This is an old public health way. We do our best,\" he said.\nIt has mostly worked. But newly confirmed clusters show one dinner, one boxing match or one religious gathering can undo weeks of work.\nInitially, Germany was thought to have done relatively well at slowing the spread, but infections there have jumped to 9,360.\nIn South Korea, where more than 270,000 people have been tested, newly discovered cases are dropping sharply, but clusters are still popping up, at a call center, at a church.\nThis week, Malaysia has reported a surge in cases linked to a religious gathering in its capital last week. Cambodia, Thailand and Indonesia also have confirmed new cases linked to that gathering.\nIt's unclear if the strategies used in an authoritarian society like Singapore would work in bigger countries whose citizens expect greater personal freedoms: In March, a Chinese couple was charged under Singapore's Infectious Diseases Act for misinforming health officials and obstructing contact tracing. If convicted, they may be imprisoned or fined.\nBut as virus controls expand to unprecedented levels in many other countries, the policies are looking prescient.\nSingapore is a small island with strong public trust in the government, \"a strong healthcare system, excellent information systems and plenty of money,\" said Pangestu. \"Many other countries, especially developing ones, do not have these capacities or characteristics.\"\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, lauded for adopting a calming, clear approach early on, said in a televised talk last week that the situation was under control but the government was planning ahead, trying to free up hospital beds to be prepared for any surge in cases.\nSingaporeans \"feel we are all in this together,\" Lee said, \"and we don't leave anyone behind.\""}, {"content": "Disabled young man dies in China after his father is quarantined due to coronavirus.

WASHINGTON (AFP) - The US will begin screening passengers on Friday (Jan 17) arriving from a Chinese city at the heart of a mysterious Sars-linked virus, officials said, after an outbreak that has stricken dozens claimed a second life. \n Three confirmed cases, meanwhile, have now been reported outside China - two in Thailand and one in Japan - even as health authorities around the world sought to assure the public that the overall risk of infection remained low. \n Martin Cetron, a senior official at the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) told reporters: \"To further protect the health of the American public during the emergence of this novel coronavirus, CDC is beginning entry screening at three ports of entry.\" \n These are San Francisco airport and New York's JFK, which both receive direct flights, as well as Los Angeles, the biggest destination for connecting flights, he said, adding: \"We're expecting that the screening over the next couple of weeks could include as many as 5000 people\" beginning Friday night. \n Incoming travellers will be asked to fill out a questionnaire and submit to a temperature check, with those showing possible signs of infection sent on to another facility for a diagnostic test that could take up to a day. \n The move came after Chinese officials said the infection had claimed its second death: a 69-year-old man who died on Wednesday in Wuhan, the central Chinese city believed to be the epicentre of an outbreak of the pathogen from the same family as the deadly Sars virus. \n No human-to-human transmission has been confirmed so far, but Wuhan's health commission has said the possibility \"cannot be excluded.\" \n The enigmatic illness has caused alarm because of its connection to Sars (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. \n Pneumonia linked to the new virus has hit at least 41 people in China, with the outbreak centered around a seafood market in Wuhan. \n Of these 12 have recovered and been discharged from hospital, according to the Wuhan health commission, while five others are in a serious condition. \n The second man to die became sick on Dec 31 and his condition worsened two weeks ago, it said, with the disease causing pulmonary tuberculosis and damage to multiple organ functions. \n Thailand reported its second case of the coronavirus on Friday: a 74-year-old Chinese woman who had arrived from Wuhan earlier this week. \n Her condition is improving, said Thai health officials, who urged people not to panic as there was \"no spread of the virus\" in the South-east Asian country. \n That sentiment was echoed by senior CDC official Nancy Messonnier, who said: \"For families sitting around the dinner table tonight, this is not something that they generally need to worry about.\" \n Yet, much remains to be understood about the \"2019 novel coronavirus\" or \"2019-nCoV,\" according to the CDC, which added that \"there are indications that some limited person-to-person spread may have occurred.\" \n The latest fatality comes as China prepares for its busiest travel season of the year next week, when millions of people take buses, trains and planes for Chinese New Year. \n China has not announced any travel restrictions but authorities in Hong Kong have stepped up detection measures, including rigorous temperature checkpoints for inbound travellers. \n The Wuhan health commission said one man who had been diagnosed worked at Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, but his wife, who also had the virus, reported \"no history of exposure\" at the facility. \n The first case in Thailand had not reported visiting the seafood market, the WHO said Tuesday. The woman was reported to be in a stable condition earlier this week. \n The patient in Japan, who was released from hospital, had also not visited the market. Japanese officials said it was possible that the man had been in contact with a person infected with the virus while in Wuhan. \n After the second death was reported, online discussion spread in China over the severity of the Wuhan coronavirus - and how much information the government is hiding from the public. \n Several complained about censorship of online posts, while others made comparisons to 2003, when Beijing drew criticism from the WHO for under-reporting the number of Sars cases. \n \"It's so strange,\" wrote a web user on the social media platform Weibo, citing the overseas cases in Japan and Thailand. \"They all have Wuhan pneumonia cases but (in China) we don't have any infections outside of Wuhan - is that scientific?\" \n But the CDC's Messonnier thanked her Chinese counterparts for quickly identifying the pathogen and making its genome publicly available to scientists around the world, allowing them to rapidly develop diagnostic tools."}, {"content": "Angola among the 13 top priority countries for surveillance due to coronavirus. Angola is among the top 13 countries of the World Health Organization (WHO) in the fight against the new coronavirus, which need to be closely watched due to their direct ties to China. In a press release, which Lusa agency had access to today, WHO, which reaffirms its active support to countries in coordinating their preparation efforts, also listed these 13 countries for the high volume of travel to China. According to WHO, additional staff have already been deployed to seven of the 13 countries, with full deployment of all teams in all countries by the end of the week. WHO is shipping essential equipment to carry out screenings and manage suspected cases at airports and points of entry. The note emphasizes that, although top priority countries represent WHO&#39;s main field of action, the United Nations will support all countries in the African region to prepare for the new coronavirus. &quot;WHO is collaborating with partners to enhance the level of preparedness in certain areas, including with regard to raising awareness in communities and increasing capacity for treatment, if necessary,&quot; says the organization. In the African region, the top priority countries are, in addition to Angola, South Africa, Algeria, C\u00f4te d&#39;Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mauritius, Nigeria, Kenya, Democratic Republic of Congo, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. The organization also says that many countries are taking advantage of the knowledge they gained during an influenza pandemic to prepare themselves, as the coronavirus causes flu-like illnesses. Allied to this fact, the note emphasizes, the countries&#39; experience in preventing and combating the Ebola outbreak recorded in 2018 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, led to an increase in surveillance capacity and in the management of cases of infection. The Angolan government announced on Thursday that it has imposed mandatory quarantine on all passengers from China and currently has 40 citizens who have returned on flights in recent days under observation. According to the Angolan Foreign Affairs minister, Manuel Augusto, the quarantine applies to Angolan, Chinese or other nationals who arrive from China or who have been in contact with affected people, in order to prevent contagion with the coronavirus, which has already caused 563 deaths in China. &quot;We already have a reference hospital in Barra do Kwanza, where there are 40 citizens who arrived on the flights a few days ago,&quot; added the head of the Angolan diplomacy. Manuel Augusto assured that the Government &quot;is complying with international standards&quot; and creating conditions to preserve public health, admitting that &quot;the measures are not nice&quot; and &quot;may disturb economic activity&quot;, because there are &quot;partners and workers who may be covered by this quarantine requirement.&quot;"}, {"content": "Singapore public hospitals in 'outbreak response mode'. All public hospital emergency departments here are in \"outbreak response mode\" as Singapore raises its defences against a mysterious, Sars-like virus that is spreading in China. \n \"We cannot rule out the possibility that the new (Wuhan) virus will reach Singapore,\" Professor Leo Yee Sin, executive director of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), told The Straits Times. The stakes are higher now that the virus has started spreading from human to human. \n All patients at emergency departments are screened, and those with fever and travel history are isolated. All general practice doctors have also been told what to look out for and given a number to call if there are any suspect patients. \n Any such call from a doctor will activate a special ambulance which will transport the suspected patient, aged above 16, straight to the NCID. Those 16 and younger will be taken to KK Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital. This is to nip the spread of the virus in the bud. The ambulance will then be properly cleaned before it is used again. \n At the NCID, the patients will be placed in special negative pressure isolation rooms, where air flows only into the rooms, not out of them. \n The air in the rooms is sucked out through high-efficiency particulate air, or Hepa, filters. \n Prof Leo said the NCID has \"high-end\" Hepa filters in 124 negative pressure isolation rooms which clean 99.999 per cent of contaminants, including viruses. \n As an extra precaution, even after it has gone through the filters, the air is further cleaned with ultraviolet rays. \n It will take the laboratory between four and eight hours to determine if the patient is infected with a coronavirus. If that test proves positive, genetic sequencing will be done to confirm that it is the new bug. That takes 24 hours. \n Prof Leo said there are a lot of coronaviruses but only seven, including this new one, that spread from human to human. \n Four types cause the common cold and are mild. The other two are the more dangerous Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome). \n Fifteen medical staff in Wuhan have contracted the bug, currently called the 2019-nCoV. \n Prof Leo said that it is not yet known whether this virus is as dangerous as Sars. \n But Singapore is not taking chances. All medical staff dealing with suspected cases are well protected with personal protective equipment (PPE). Laboratory staff will also have PPE and powered air purifying respirators - to filter out any possible virus. \n Prof Leo said Singapore has a stockpile of the disposable PPE as well as the powered air purifying respirators - enough to supply all hospitals should a major outbreak occur here. \"Yes it is expensive, but protection of staff is the most important thing,\" said Prof Leo, a veteran of the Sars outbreak in 2003, when medical staff caring for infected patients were among the 238 people infected and the 33 who died. \n The 330-bed NCID, which opened slightly over a year ago, has more than 100 \"surge beds\" which are kept empty and on standby for national emergencies. \n Although the flu vaccine does not protect against the Wuhan bug, she said it is a good idea to get vaccinated. On a national level, it will \"cut down on the background noise\". \n She added that should there be a positive case of the Wuhan bug here, people will be told. \n \"We need to be able to share the information and be able to guide the public, as well as the entire public healthcare system, to be able to handle the situation,\" she said. \n WIDER DEFINITION \n Singapore's Ministry of Health has widened its definition of suspect cases, and it will now include anyone with pneumonia who had been to China - not just Wuhan - within 14 days of the start of the illness. Anyone with acute respiratory infection who has been to any hospital in China within a fortnight of getting ill will also be treated as a suspect case. \n MORE SCREENINGS \n From today, Changi Airport will conduct temperature screening for all flights from China, and not just those from Wuhan. So far, all seven suspected cases in Singapore have proven not to have the Wuhan bug. \n SUSPECT CASES \n All patients at emergency departments are screened, and those with fever and travel history are isolated. At the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), the patients will be placed in special negative pressure isolation rooms, where air flows only into the rooms, not out of them. \n The air in the rooms is sucked out through high-efficiency particulate air, or Hepa, filters. As an extra precaution, even after it has gone through the filters, the air is further cleaned with ultraviolet rays. \n GP DOCS ON THE WATCH \n All general practice doctors have been told what to look out for and given a number to call if there are any suspect patients. \n SPECIAL AMBULANCES \n Any such call from a doctor will activate a special ambulance which will transport the suspected patient, aged above 16, straight to the NCID. Those 16 and younger will be taken to KK Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital. This is to nip the spread of the virus in the bud.

Climate scientists tell us that climate change will not only bring about rising sea levels and more extreme weather events, it also increases the likelihood of epidemics. But despite the clear linkage between the two, our response to the current Covid-19 pandemic is almost completely opposite to our usual response to climate change. \n While the coronavirus can be fatal, the risk that one will die from the disease is (still) low. Nonetheless, governments in hard hit areas have acted promptly to declare \u201cwar\u201d on the pandemic while societies have made large sacrifices to contain the disease. \n With climate change, while the impacts are far greater in terms of loss of lives and risk to the very survival of the human species, mitigating climate change is seldom a priority in a government\u2019s resource allocation decisions. \n In short, we respond to epidemics (when they occur) with excessive fear and pessimism, even as we routinely discount the risks of, and are naively optimistic about, the very thing that makes them\u00a0more likely. \n In dealing with low-probability, high-dread events such as dying from Covid-19, we systemically overestimate our risks \u2014\u00a0much like how people overestimate their risks of dying in a terrorist attack or a plane crash relative to far more common causes of death. \n On the other hand, people and institutions underestimate the high (and increasing) risk of climate catastrophe. How do we explain this paradox? \n PROBABILITY NEGLECT, PRESENT BIAS AND GLOBAL COMMONS \n Our overestimation of risks linked to the coronavirus and our underestimation of climate risks are two sides of the same coin; they are explained by a bias called probability neglect. \n When dealing with risks (whether the risk of an epidemic or of climate change), we do not rely on actual probabilities but on how easily the risk comes to mind (saliency bias), our instincts, and our instant emotive reactions (the affect heuristic). \n The coronavirus is very salient; we are constantly inundated by news of it and daily updates of the numbers infected and dead around the world. It also evokes strong emotional reactions, especially fear. Salience combined with fear causes us to believe that something is far more probable than it is. \n Climate change is exactly the opposite. It is usually not salient as most people believe it will occur in some distant future. Climate change also does not evoke strong emotional responses in most people, except possibly for the young. Being an abstraction for most people, climate risks are systematically underestimated. \n The result of our collective fear is that governments prioritise the \u201cwar\u201d against the Covid-19 pandemic, often at the expense of other priorities. \n Global supply chains have also been disrupted; financial markets are roiled by the news of the disease spreading and of rising number of infections. \n The different responses to coronavirus and climate change also stem from what is known as present-biased preferences. People tend to overvalue immediate costs or benefits while discounting long-term impacts. \n In the case of the coronavirus, people are willing to make immediate sacrifices as there are short-term benefits, that of being protected from a potentially life-threatening disease.\u00a0 \n With climate change, people are reluctant to incur even small costs today because the benefits (such as the survival of mankind and preservation of the natural environment) are in the future and, therefore, heavily discounted.\u00a0 \n Climate change and epidemics are both problems of the global commons. Effective solutions require cooperation and coordination between governments.\u00a0 \n But such cooperation is difficult because every country has an incentive to free ride on the efforts of others. \n With epidemics, this free-rider problem is less pronounced as the domestic costs of an epidemic are high enough for most governments to take some preventive measures. \n With climate change, the free-rider problem (and the consequent tragedy of commons) seems more insurmountable. \n The benefits of not taking any climate action are internalised (that is, the benefits are fully captured by the country not taking climate action), while the costs to the global commons are externalised (that is, the costs are shared or distributed to the rest of the world). \n LESSONS FOR CLIMATE ACTION \n First, there is an opportunity for those of us who wish to see more resolute climate action to use the coronavirus crisis to emphasise the causal link between climate change and epidemics.\u00a0 \n Our message to governments and our fellow citizens should be: \u201cIf you do not wish to live with more of such viruses, we must take far more aggressive action on climate change.\u201d \n Second, there are many things governments can do to highlight the salience of climate risks. \n For example, just as the number of confirmed infections and deaths from the coronavirus has been highly visible, governments should also provide regular information on the costs and damages of climate change, as well as how these are expected to rise. \n Third, governments can take steps to counter our present bias. With the coronavirus, the benefits of governments taking aggressive action now are clear for all to see.\u00a0 \n With climate change, governments need to find ways to create a sense of crisis to persuade their populations that the costs of climate change are already upon us, and that the sacrifices needed to deal with it cannot be delayed anymore. \n Finally, the costs of climate change do not have to be fully internalised for countries to take action; they only need to be sufficiently internalised.\u00a0 \n That the coronavirus began in China, the fastest growing emitter of carbon emissions, also creates an opportunity for China to play a leadership role in climate change mitigation. By doing so, China would also reduce the risks of future epidemics. \n \u00a0 \n ABOUT THE AUTHORS: \n Donald Low is senior lecturer and professor of practice in public policy at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, where Xun Wu is professor and head of the Division of Public Policy.

Whether a country's developmental strategy is right depends on that country's situation, said the spokesman, citing China's progress over the past 70 years to become the world's second-largest economy, and lifting over 800 million people out of poverty. \n Those achievements were made under the leadership of the CCP and the \"system of socialism with Chinese characteristics\", benefiting not just China but the rest of the world. \"Though Mr Bilahari himself did not deny China's great achievements, he still criticised the political system and the leadership system that created them.

LONDON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Here are some key features of viruses and the new coronavirus that was identified in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December and is causing an outbreak of disease in China and beyond.\n* Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that get their name from what they look like under a microscope - they are spherical and their surfaces are covered with \u201ccrown\u201d-like spikes.\n* Coronavirus infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, coughing, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Mild cases can cause cold-like symptoms, while severe cases can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory illness, kidney failure and death.\n* Like other coronaviruses, the newly identified China coronavirus is being transmitted from person-to-person via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes. It can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles or railings.\n* Infection with the newly identified virus has an incubation period of between one and 14 days, and there are limited accounts that it may also be spreading before symptoms show.\n* Infectious disease and virus specialists say the scale of the current outbreak now points to \u201cself-sustaining\u201d human-to-human transmission.

Deco received nearly 44 requests per hour on the travelers&#39; helpline about the new coronavirus, launched at 3:00 pm on Wednesday, in a total of 481 calls, the consumer protection association informed Lusa. The balance of the first 11 hours of the line, which runs between 10:00 am and 6:00 pm, without a break for lunch, reveals a very significant increase compared to the 50 traveler contacts that Deco announced, on the day it launched the line, that it had received in the last week. The average number of calls registered on that line per hour is slightly lower than the total number of calls, on average, registered in the last week, showing an increase in travel-related requests in the context of an epidemic of the new coronavirus in several countries around the world. The &quot;Covid-19 Travel Inquiries&quot; line, available at 213 710 282, offers legal advice on travel, cancellations and alterations, but not on health. On this line, Deco&#39;s lawyers request specific information from consumers, such as dates and location of the trip, accommodation, the type of trip (if it is organized), and check whether or not there are official recommendations not to travel to that destination, whether there is a declared outbreak of epidemic or not. &quot;If there is a conflict between the consumer and an air carrier or the travel agency itself, we can [through the telephone line] assist the consumer in resolving these conflicts, through our mediation process&quot;, said the coordinator of the legal and economic department of Deco , Paulo Fonseca. Paulo Fonseca admitted that the cancellation and alteration of trips to Italy or China, for which there are currently recommendations not to travel (in the case of Italy, there is even, in addition to the Government&#39;s recommendation, another from the regional direction of Education for student travel ), are easier to solve than others, with destinations not covered by these recommendations. The association says it is holding meetings with some stakeholders, such as the Portuguese Association of Travel and Tourism Agencies (APAVT), with a view to &quot;trying to concert measures&quot;, so that the same solution is given to consumers in the same situation, and looking for alternatives to booked trips if this is what the consumer wants. &quot;We don&#39;t want to create alarmism for consumers, but we also don&#39;t want their rights to be ignored,&quot; said Paulo Fonseca, specifying that Deco intends to defend consumers&#39; rights to health and safety when they conflict with other rights. , such as those of air carriers.

On Feb 18, just five weeks ago, I started my Budget 2020 speech setting out what we must do to combat the threats posed by the Covid-19 outbreak. At that time, there were 800 confirmed cases outside of China. \n The outbreak has escalated quickly. Three weeks after my Budget speech, on March 11, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared Covid-19 a pandemic, recognising the severity and risk of further global spread. \n Today, the WHO estimates that the number of people infected has exceeded 410,000, across more than 190 countries. \n The Covid-19 outbreak is a battle on many fronts - medical, economic and social. \n First, on the medical front, countries are taking extraordinary measures to contain the spread of the virus, so that their healthcare systems are not overwhelmed. Many countries have implemented lockdowns, while the United States has declared a national emergency. \n In Singapore, we are doing everything we can to keep you and your families safe. We acted early and decisively. As the severity of the virus outbreak grew worldwide, we stepped up our measures. This has, so far, helped to keep the number of cases at manageable levels during the first wave. \n However, as much as we try, the Covid-19 pandemic is likely to take at least a year to be resolved, and the economic repercussions would last even longer. The world is seeing successive waves of infection, and importation of infections. We must be prepared to take further tougher measures. \n Yet, measures on the medical front to contain the pandemic, both in Singapore and around the world, have made the second front of the battle - the economic front - even more difficult. These public health measures have caused severe economic disruptions and uncertainties. As more countries implement their measures, the economic disruptions will be wider, deeper and more prolonged. \n The global economy is now facing both a supply and demand shock. \n On the supply side, supply chains have been disrupted as locked-down workers are unable to work. With highly integrated global supply chains, a disruption in any one part of the chain, or in any one country, will have knock-on effects worldwide. \n Passengers at Changi Airport on Monday, one in a protective suit, mask and shoe covers. The extraordinary situation of the pandemic calls for extraordinary measures, says Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat. PHOTO: REUTERS \n On the demand side, aggregate demand has fallen as people stay home and curtail spending. Consumer and business confidence are plunging in the face of growing uncertainties. \n The International Monetary Fund has downgraded its 2020 global growth forecast three times since January 2019, and flagged that a further downgrade is imminent in April. It added that it expects a recession at least as bad as during the 2008 global financial crisis. \n Global financial markets are being roiled by the mounting uncertainties and cutback in economic activity. Stock markets have come down from their peak some weeks ago. \n The S&P 500 index took only 22 trading days to fall by 30 per cent from its peak, making it the fastest drop of this magnitude in history. The key volatility indices in Europe and the US, which some call the \"fear index\", briefly reached levels last seen during the global financial crisis. \n Credit has tightened across the world, and the US yield curve has fallen below 1 per cent for the first time in history. The disruptions around the world will significantly curtail global demand, disrupt supply chains, and possibly lead to financial shocks. As an open economy that is highly integrated with the global economy, we will be deeply impacted by these global shocks. \n Based on advance gross domestic product (GDP) estimates released this morning, in the first quarter, the Singapore economy contracted by 10.6 per cent quarter on quarter, or 2.2 per cent year on year, reversing the 0.6 per cent growth in the previous quarter. \n This morning, the Ministry of Trade and Industry further downgraded Singapore's GDP growth forecast for 2020, from a range of minus 0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent announced last month, to between minus 4 per cent and minus 1 per cent. \n This extraordinary situation calls for extraordinary measures. \n Last month, I committed $6.4 billion in the Unity Budget towards the Stabilisation and Support Package, the Care and Support Package, and to support our front-line agencies. \n Today, I will introduce measures worth over $48 billion in this Resilience Budget, to deal decisively with the situation at hand. This is over seven times of the first tranche. \n Altogether, we are dedicating close to $55 billion to support our people in this battle, amounting to 11 per cent of our GDP. This is a landmark package, and a necessary response to a unique situation. \n The Government has sought and obtained the President's in-principle support to draw up to $17 billion from our past reserves to fund part of the Resilience Budget. \n The Resilience Budget focuses on three key areas: \n \u2022First, save jobs, support workers and protect livelihoods. \n \u2022Second, help enterprises overcome immediate challenges. \n \u2022Third, strengthen economic and social resilience so that we can emerge intact and stronger. \n Let me now elaborate on our considerations for drawing on past reserves in this budget, and our fiscal position after the measures that I have put forth to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic. \n Our reserves are our strategic asset, built up through the discipline and prudence of our people and political leaders, across generations. \n Our reserves serve as our bulwark against shocks and crises of an extraordinary nature. For a nation with no oil, no gas, no gold, no diamonds, or natural resources of any kind, it is remarkable that we have built this up. \n Our prudence and discipline in saving and growing our reserves give us the wherewithal to respond decisively when our nation faces extraordinary circumstances. \n Our founding fathers created a rigorous framework to ensure that such strategic assets are used only for the right purpose. We amended the Constitution in 1991 to provide for an elected president who is the custodian of our past reserves. \n Under Article 148A of the Constitution, the President can withhold her assent to any supply Bill if she is of the view that it is likely to draw on past reserves. \n Our principle is that each term of government must live within its means. Any additional spending that the government of the day proposes must be funded in a sustainable manner - recurrent expenditures should be funded from recurrent revenues. \n Past reserves can be drawn down only in exceptional circumstances, under a two-key system, if the President, after consulting the Council of Presidential Advisers, agrees with the Government's proposal to draw on the past reserves in exceptional situations. \n Despite political pressure to dip into the reserves, the Government has scrupulously upheld the principle that past reserves are to be used only for exceptional situations. \n Until now, the Government has drawn on past reserves only once, during the global financial crisis, when the President approved a draw of $4.9 billion to fund the Jobs Credit Scheme and special risk-sharing initiative. \n During that period, the Government also sought the President's concurrence to use $150 billion of past reserves to back the deposit guarantee scheme. I was at the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) at that time. We had asked for this, and it took us a long time to deliberate on this. As it turned out, the guarantee was not triggered, and there was no draw on past reserves. \n The Covid-19 pandemic, and the multiple threats it poses to our nation, is the sort of event that we had accumulated reserves for. \n We have saved up for a rainy day. The Covid-19 pandemic is already a mighty storm, and is still growing. \n If over the years we had frittered the reserves away, on more immediate but less existential needs, big and small, as some in this House have pressed the Government to do, we would be in a much weaker position today. \n We are experiencing a confluence of multiple external shocks - a pandemic that has triggered many nations to shut their borders, limit exports and halt economic activities, in order to fight this pandemic. \n This economic impact is magnified, as the global economy is already fragile, and further weakened by a protracted US-China trade conflict, and an oil price war. \n So this is not a normal business cycle that we would have anticipated and dealt with using the revenues collected by each term of government. It is a \"black swan\" event that comes only once every few decades. \n In view of the exceptional circumstances, the Government has sought the President's in-principle support to use past reserves to fund part of the package. \n The Covid-19 situation is fluid and fast-moving, and nobody is quite sure how it will develop. But because we have prepared ourselves well, Singapore has the resources to meet this crisis with confidence. \n We will use our resources to get through this together. \n The Government will continue to monitor the situation closely. Should it become necessary, I am prepared to propose to the President further draws on past reserves to deal with the situation. I trust that every member of this House will deeply internalise the mission to be careful stewards of our reserves. \n The measures that I have announced today will raise the overall Budget deficit for FY2020 to $39.2 billion (7.9 per cent of GDP). We are able to support this unprecedented deficit, and still remain fiscally sustainable, because we have been disciplined in the use of past reserves, tapping them only in exceptional circumstances like these. \n The situation remains highly fluid and uncertain, with significant risks. Our fiscal position will be affected from both the revenue and expenditure sides. \n With a weak GDP outlook, our revenues will be affected. Sentiment-driven revenues may come down sharply. \n While revenues are coming down, our expenditure will be going up, to enable us to respond effectively to the crisis. In the past few years, we benefited from unexpected revenue upsides, such as exceptional statutory board contributions from MAS and increased stamp duty collections. We cannot hope to rely on a repeat of this. Instead, we must be prepared to bear the down sides when they happen. Because we have been prudent and did not decide to spend all of the surplus that we collected, we are ready to meet such downsides. \n We can expect significant volatility in the economy, and in financial markets, in the near future. We will need to continue to review our expenditure plans very carefully in this fluid situation. We will adopt a nimble fiscal posture, so that we can quickly channel the resources at hand to the most urgent and important needs of our people. \n The Covid-19 pandemic is the most serious crisis we have faced in a generation. \n It has put all countries around the world to the test - on the medical, economic and social fronts. \n We have been able to respond boldly and decisively to the outbreak in Singapore, because we have forged a cohesive, resilient society. The whole nation has come together in response. Our healthcare and front-line workers are working tirelessly to care for the infected. Our cleaners are doing humble but heroic work to keep our environment clean. \n Thousands of public officers are working round the clock to respond to the threat of Covid-19. The private sector and corporations too have stepped forward. \n Individuals are doing their part - vloggers and bloggers are helping to share public messages, others are volunteering, giving support and encouragement and, crucially, by complying with health advisories and practising safe distancing. These include foreigners who live among us and who care deeply about Singapore. \n Many have also had to make sacrifices in this time. Families have had to make difficult adjustments to their lives, some having to undergo quarantine, cancel celebrations or put off other long-awaited plans, including wedding plans. \n And despite our best efforts to work with businesses and unions to save jobs, some workers have suffered a loss of income or jobs. \n The Government and the political leadership are in this with Singaporeans. We share the worries and anxieties of Singaporeans, and we will do our best for you. \n To show solidarity with Singaporeans, I announced at the Budget debate last month that the political leadership will take a one-month pay cut. With the deteriorating situation, we will go further. All political office-holders will take an additional pay cut of two months, altogether a three-month cut in their salary. \n The President, Speaker and both deputy Speakers have informed me that they will join in, and take a similar three-month pay cut in total. \n It is in times of crisis that the true character of a nation can be seen. \n The months ahead will not be easy, as the situation continues to evolve dynamically and unpredictably. We must continue to be on high vigilance, mentally and psychologically prepared for every scenario. \n The Government will lead the way. We will do our best to anticipate and respond to developments, make decisions based on facts and evidence, and exercise judgment when there are trade-offs. \n While we attend to the immediate and urgent tasks, we will set our sights on the long term, so that Singapore comes out of this crisis stronger as a nation. \n We will protect and advance the well-being and livelihoods of Singaporeans. We will take care of our people. We will leave no one behind. And we will stand with Singaporeans of all walks of life to battle this crisis, together. \n We are all in this together. And we must all look after one another in these trying times. \n This is the essence of who we are as a nation. This is the essence of who we are as a people. This is SG United.

When cases of the new coronavirus appeared to be slowing down in the epicenter of the outbreak, 14,000 new cases were registered this Thursday in the Hubei region, where the city of Wuhan is located. This increase, justify the Chinese authorities, may be related to a different form of diagnosis: as there are few tests, health professionals are counting for statistics the cases diagnosed through computed tomography of the lungs. Altogether there are now 60,000 confirmed cases of infection and more than 1360 confirmed deaths in mainland China alone (254 of these deaths registered in the last 24 hours, double the number registered the day before). This is the biggest increase in the number of deaths since the virus, now called \u201cCovid-19\u201d, was identified in late December.

This Thursday, 15,152 new cases of infection were registered across China (more than 13,000 with the new form of diagnosis), whereas the day before there had been 2015 new cases. Until now, cases in Hubei province could only be confirmed as being Covid-19 when there was confirmation from RNA (ribonucleic acid) tests, which have genetic information in which organisms such as viruses can be identified.

Outside the People&#39;s Republic there are more than 270 other cases in more than two dozen countries, 14 of them in Germany. China plans the equivalent of almost ten billion euros for the fight against the epidemic. The money should, among other things, ensure that all Chinese can afford a virus test and treatment, said the Ministry of Finance. It should also be prevented that financial bottlenecks hinder the use to contain Corona in the individual regions. The growing number of infections and deaths from the new virus worries many Chinese who return to work on Monday after the extended New Year break. Displeasure with the authorities and doubts about the official case numbers were voiced on social media. The vacation had been extended to contain the spread of the virus. In Spain, a second infection with the corona virus has meanwhile been confirmed. In Mallorca, a person tested positive for the pathogen, said the National Microbiology Center. Tests on three other people were negative. The four were in contact with someone in France who was subsequently diagnosed with the disease. Five new cases had previously been reported in France. French Health Minister Agn\u00e8s Buzyn said a child and four adults with British citizenship had tested positive for the virus in France. Twelve cases in Germany can be traced back to a Chinese employee at the Bavarian auto supplier Webasto. Two returnees who had flown out of China also tested positive. In addition, according to information (as of Friday evening) from the World Health Organization (WHO) there are cases in Italy, Great Britain, Russia, Belgium, Finland and Sweden. There are at least 37 infected people in Europe. At the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organization WHO an accumulation of pneumonia of unknown cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Just a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days later, a group led by virologist Christian Drosten from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers are provisionally calling 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. The Chinese authorities suspect the source of the pathogen to be a food market in Wuhan, where not only fish and seafood but also exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected. Both Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic in 2002 and 2003, around 8,000 people were infected and more than 750 died. Between its discovery in 2012 and the end of 2019, around 2,500 people were infected with the Mers virus, and every third person died from it. In total, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example. Several thousand people have now become ill in China, some of them - most of them probably with previous illnesses - died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first cases of infection outside of China became known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been to Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who was returning from Wuhan, and on January 24, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia, which can be fatal. Since it is a viral disease, antibiotics won&#39;t help. It is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after a dozen or so cases among medical personnel became known. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. As it announced on January 24, the World Health Organization currently expects that an infected person will infect an average of 1.4 to 2.5 other people. If these numbers prove to be true, the virus is less contagious than Sars and so is the flu. The WHO recommends following general hygiene rules: You should wash your hands often and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals. It is not yet possible to say with certainty. The World Health Organization announced on January 28th that around a fifth of the reported cases would become seriously ill from the virus, so if in doubt they would have to be treated in intensive care. According to reports, the first fatalities were patients, some of whom had serious previous illnesses. People with previous illnesses are also particularly at risk from other infectious diseases - such as the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, i.e. change their genetic makeup. That can make them more dangerous to people in the course of an outbreak - but also the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate that is as high as that of the Sars outbreak. According to its own information, the WHO is taking action against the spread of false information about the new virus. They caused confusion and fear among the population, said WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. &quot;We are therefore also fighting the trolls and conspiracy theorists who spread false information and thus undermine the work against the outbreak,&quot; said Tedros. You are in contact with numerous social networks. &quot;We asked them to filter out incorrect information and encourage correct information from trustworthy sources.&quot; The WHO also sought contact with influencers via Instagram and YouTube and asked them to spread factual news about the virus. According to Tedros, the focus is on the Asia-Pacific region. According to a study by Chinese scientists, the novel virus could also be transmitted via faeces. Some patients at a Wuhan hospital had diarrhea and nausea first before the onset of fever symptoms and breathing difficulties, according to a paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The course of the disease started with diarrhea and nausea in ten percent of 138 sufferers, the scientists write. They said they primarily focused on respiratory symptoms in the early cases of the disease, which first emerged in Wuhan in December. Symptoms related to the digestive tract may have been missed. The Sars virus, which, like the novel disease, is triggered by coronaviruses, was also partially transmitted during the epidemic in the early 2000s. David Fisman, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto, warned that fecal contamination could pose a new challenge to contain the viral disease, especially in hospitals. The main route of transmission of the virus is still a droplet infection via a sick person&#39;s cough."}, {"content": "China heads into Lunar New Year on shutdown as virus spreads to Europe.

For most, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms. But it can cause more severe illness in others, especially older adults and people with existing health conditions. Some 92,000 people have recovered, mostly in China, where the virus first struck late last year.\nThe virus rebels tend to range from restless teens to wealthy adults who can travel to their getaway homes. Even in Italy, where the virus death toll soared beyond China's last week, authorities are still trying to rein in people from going outside for fresh air, sun and visits with friends to escape walled-in lives.\nFrench farmers' markets where people congregate to shop for food have posed a special challenge for police trying to keep people apart from each other at the recommended 2 meters (6 feet), along with neglected urban housing projects where distrust and disobedience of authorities runs deep.\nIn Clichy-Sous-Bois, a Paris suburb where nationwide riots triggered by police harassment allegations erupted in 2005, a person bit a police officer trying to enforce confinement rules, said Linda Kebbab, a police union spokesperson.

In the southeastern Murcia region, they posted video of police stopping a person waddling outside in a full-body dinosaur costume and tweeted that pets can be taken for brief walks by owners but that \"having a Tyrannosaurus Rex complex is not\" allowed.\nAnd in Spain's northeastern region of Catalonia, police posted a picture of a man walking a goat on a leash, apparently trying to take advantage of the pet walking exception.\nFrance now has 100,000 security personnel on the streets who are issuing fines amid a new national \"Stay Home\" mantra and warnings by officials that the country's two-week lockdown could be extended if the country's infection rate keeps rising.

Health officials have warned that the Wuhan outbreak has reached a \"critical stage\", as the virus mutates and the outbreak continues to spread to more provinces, territories and countries. \n The United States and Macau registered their first cases yesterday, while infected people have been identified for the first time in Hainan, Fujian, Liaoning and Anhui, widening the number of affected provinces to more than 20. \n Hong Kong reported that a man had preliminarily tested positive for the virus, but a final test result would be known only today. \n The authorities fear the number of cases will soar as hundreds of millions of Chinese travel across or out of the country during the Chinese New Year holidays. \n The death toll climbed to 17 and, as of last night, at least 540 people have tested positive for the 2019-nCoV virus, which scientists have determined is part of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) family. \n The National Health Commission's emergency management office director Xu Shuqiang said the country is at a critical stage in its battle to stop the viral outbreak from turning into a pandemic. \n The virus is believed to have originated from wild animals sold illegally at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, Hubei province, where the first wave of patients had worked at, said virologist Gao Fu. \n \"From animal to human, the virus has adapted and evolved. The relationship between viruses and humans is like a cat and mouse game,\" said Professor Gao, who is director-general of the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. \n While experts said the biggest worry is the emergence of super-spreaders, Prof Gao said there is no evidence of these highly infectious individuals yet, even though 14 healthcare workers were infected by one single carrier in Wuhan. \n The World Health Organisation identifies a super-spreader as someone who infects more than 10 secondary contacts. \n \"We will be monitoring closely because there is the possibility of super-spreaders,\" said Prof Gao. \n Wuhan Mayor Zhang Xianwang said the 14 healthcare workers - a doctor and 13 nurses - were infected by a patient in a neurosurgery ward who had not been tested for the new coronavirus. He developed a fever only after his surgery. \n \"That was a very profound lesson,\" said Mr Zhang, who has appealed to people not to travel in or out of the city. \n More than 90 per cent of the infection cases have been in Wuhan. The central Chinese city of 11 million has been on high alert as the authorities step up checks on travellers and vehicles. \n All trading of wildlife has been banned, and restaurants have been prohibited from serving dishes with the animals. \n News that the disease is now being spread through human contact sent jitters across cities, as people rushed out to buy face masks and disinfectants. Phar-macies in Beijing and Shanghai ran low on stocks, especially after the country launched a nationwide hygiene campaign. \n Beijing-based insurance agent Kevin Tu, 40, was bent on going home to Wuhan today to spend the new year with his parents. But he sought a refund for his air ticket yesterday after his parents insisted that he stay put in the capital city. \n \"They were worried about my safety, but I am worried about theirs too. I have told them to stay home as much as possible, and to avoid crowded places,\" Mr Tu, an only child, told The Straits Times. \n On Monday, the health commission upgraded the Wuhan pneumonia to a Class B infectious disease, which puts it in the same category as Sars. But it is handling the outbreak with stricter measures under a Class A category, which stipulates that an infection anywhere in the country must be reported within two hours. \n The Class A classification also allows for greater resources to be mobilised. \n Ms Jiao Yahui, a health commission official, said while there are hospitals currently designated for treating the pneumonia patients, the authorities' contingency plans include backup hospitals in case the epidemic becomes widespread. \n Front-line medical workers including Chinese traditional medi-cine practitioners in Beijing told ST that they have been made to cancel their Chinese New Year leave to be on standby since Tuesday. \n Hospitals in the capital city have set up pre-screening triages, and suspected cases are transferred to fever clinics. \"We just hope this battle will pass soon,\" said Chinese traditional medicine physician Jia Xiaoming, 30."}, {"content": "Sale of masks soars in Delhi as city alarmed over coronavirus threat. Amid the coronavirus alarm, the sale of N95 face masks has soared in Delhi, triggering a massive shortage of the protective gear and a rise in its price in many areas.\nThe masks have vanished from the medical stores in some places including those around RML Hospital where the number of patients under observation rose to six on Monday. Another eight patients have tested negative and they have been discharged.\nWhere masks are still available, in Connaught Place, for instance, long queues formed at the stores. Customers were also seen snapping up hand sanitisers and thermometers.\nShops that have run out of N95 masks have no idea as to when their next delivery would arrive. Vendors of medical supplies said that masks were becoming harder to source. Uttam, a medical store owner near RML Hospital, confirmed that there has been a surge in the demand for masks after coronavirus cases were reported in India. \"We have sold around 10,000 masks in a week. These include both N95 and surgical masks. N95s are out of stock at the moment,\" he said.\nPawan, another medical store owner near RML Hospital, admitted that the increase in demand has spiked prices. \"A plain mask which used to cost Rs 5 is now being sold at Rs 10. Also, we used to buy one N95 for Rs 100. Now we're not getting it even for Rs 150,\" he said.\nMedical supply vendors said people who cannot get N95 masks are buying regular ones. However, according to Dr Sandeep Nayar, HOD, Respiratory Medicine, BLK Super Speciality Hospital, regular masks do not protect people from the Chinese virus.\n\"Only special masks like N95 or N99 can prevent coronavirus infection. These too should be tightly worn. Mouth and nose should be properly covered,\" he said.\nLast week, India banned exports of all kinds of personal protection equipment, including masks. The move aims at meeting the rising demand for such products.\nTHE EXPORT BAN \nOn Friday, the All India Food and Drug Licence Association (AFDLH) had sought a ban on the export of surgical and N95 masks as they were not available in local markets.\n\"Manufacturers are getting huge orders for these masks which are being sold for 10-times more than their actual price. Due to this, Indian citizens will find it difficult to get these masks when needed. Hence the export and the price of these masks should be controlled,\" AFDLH had written to the government.\n\"Given the high and lucrative demand internationally, manufacturers are ignoring the need in local markets and were busy in meeting the export demands. These trade activities had put Indians at the risk of not getting the masks to be safe from this virus. So, we demanded the government to ban its export and regulate the prices,\" said Abhay Pande, president, AFDLH.\nThe N95 respirator is designed to fit very closely to the face and, as a result, more efficiently filters airborne particles. The N95 face mask is available online but delivery can take up to two weeks, making it a less feasible option for customers.\nAt a high-level meeting on Monday, Health Ministry officials said that adequate materials like personal protection equipment (PPE) and N95 masks are available and the Centre is closely monitoring the situation in all states and Union Territories. coronavirus causes a flu-like severe respiratory ailment and can spread from person to person by airborne droplets that an infected person expels when sneezing or coughing.\n\"One must avoid direct contact with those suspected to have been infected by coronavirus. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth and nose if you have not washed your hands properly. Cover your face while coughing or sneezing with a tissue,\" Nayar said.\nCENTRAL GOVT SWINGS INTO ACTION \nMeanwhile, a Group of Ministers (GoM) was formed on the directive of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It held a meeting to review the preparedness to contain the spread of the virus in the country. The GoM includes Union ministers Harsh Vardhan, Hardeep Singh Puri, S Jaishankar, G Kishan Reddy, Ashwini Kumar Choubey and Mansukh Lal Mandaviya.\nThe ministers were apprised of the three confirmed cases reported from Kerala and the preventive steps and measures taken to contain coronavirus.\nThe GoM also took note of the government announcing a temporary suspension of the e-visa facility for Chinese travellers and foreigners residing in the neighbouring country and a fresh advisory saying anyone with travel history to China since January 15 can be quarantined.\nThe government has also advised that people having compelling reasons to visit India should contact the Indian embassy in Beijing or consulate in Shanghai or Guangzhou.\nSo far 645 people have been transported to India from Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak. They have been admitted to quarantine centres of the Army and the ITBP in and around the National Capital.\nTests conducted for coronavirus on 406 people, who were evacuated to Delhi from China's Wuhan city to an ITBP facility in Chhawla area, have been negative till now, a senior official of the border guarding force said. The Kerala government has declared the coronavirus epidemic as a state calamity with a third student testing positive for the infection in the state. The decision was taken at the apex committee of the State Disaster Management Authority chaired by Chief Secretary Tom Jose. Two earlier positive cases, also of students who came back from Wuhan, were reported from Thrissur and Alapuzha districts.\nMeanwhile, the death toll in China soared to 425 with 64 deaths on Monday while the number of confirmed cases climbed to 20,400, Chinese health officials announced on Monday."}, {"content": "it\u2019s \u2018battle against nature\u2019 for covid-19 and more time is needed to learn about disease: moh official. SINGAPORE \u2014 The Covid-19 disease appears to be \u201ccontainable\u201d based on the measures that some countries, including Singapore, have taken to combat the coronavirus outbreak, even though much is still unknown about it, said the director of communicable diseases at the Ministry of Health (MOH). \n \u201cChina, Hong Kong, Singapore have (put in place) quite a few different measures and different styles of containment, and they seem to be reducing the number of new cases. \n \u201cSo perhaps it is not quite as transmissible as influenza,\u201d Dr Vernon Lee said on Tuesday (Feb 25) at a panel discussing how Singapore has responded to the Covid-19 outbreak so far.\u00a0\u00a0 \n However, he stressed repeatedly that more time is needed to understand the transmission and the severity characteristics of Covid-19.\u00a0 \n \u201cTime will tell. I think we still need to learn more about this disease.\u201d \n Dr Lee, who is also an adjunct associate professor at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, was one of four panellists at the discussion organised by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) and streamed live on its Facebook page. \n The others were economist Barnabas Gan from the United Overseas Bank (UOB); Dr Carol Soon, senior research fellow at IPS; and Dr Shashi Jayakumar, senior fellow at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS). \n They delved into how Singapore has dealt with the medical, economic, and social impact of the public health emergency. \n Dr Lee was asked by Dr Gillian Koh, moderator and deputy director of research at IPS, to give his take on how medical science and epidemiologists around the world are dealing with the new coronavirus, which had its first outbreak in Wuhan of China\u2019s Hubei province in December last year. \n In response, he said it is unprecedented the way in which the amount of information known about Covid-19 has ballooned in the past two months, but there are still several unknowns.\u00a0 \n \u201cIt is a battle against nature, and with time, some of these answers will be clearer.\u201d \n When it came to establishing the mortality rate of the disease, for example, it is challenging to detect milder cases of Covid-19, which may also skew the statistics on case fatality rates by several magnitudes, he said. \n In Singapore, more than 10 per cent of Covid-19 cases have been admitted to the intensive care unit, which \u201cis certainly concerning\u201d, Dr Lee said. \n \u201cBecause of the sheer number of people that are affected across the globe, (Covid-19) still caused many deaths. So we do not want to trivialise any virus because it has some potential impact.\u201d \n  From left: Dr Gillian Koh, Dr Vernon Lee, Mr Barnabas Gan,\u00a0Dr Carol Soon and Dr Shashi Jayakumar at a panel discussion organised by the Institute of Policy Studies.\u00a0Photo: Institute of Policy Studies, National University of Singapore \u00a0 \n TOURISM LOSS COULD WIPE OUT 2020 ECONOMIC GAINS \n Since the time needed to fully learn about Covid-19 may be protracted, the economic impact of this disease can be significant, considering that Singapore\u2019s economy was affected only across a single quarter during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) pandemic in 2003, Mr Gan\u00a0said. \n Before the outbreak arrived in Singapore, UOB predicted that Singapore\u2019s economy would grow by 1.5 per cent this year. \n However, current economic figures now point to a 25 to 30 per cent fall in tourism arrivals, which could work out to a S$6.8 billion to S$8.1 billion fall in tourism receipts this year due to the viral outbreak, he said. This is equivalent to the 1.5 per cent growth that UOB predicted earlier for 2020. \n \u201cThat will completely wipe out our GDP (gross domestic product) and bring it to around 0.5 per cent, just based on how much our tourism receipts actually fall,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \n Dr Koh noted that the fall could be greater, given the impact on other non-tourism sectors such as aviation, manufacturing, retail, and food-and-beverage. She asked Mr Gan whether the measures announced during Budget 2020 were\u00a0enough to bolster Singapore through this period. \n In his Budget speech last week, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat had announced that the Government will set aside a total of S$6.4 billion to help workers, firms, households and frontline agencies tackle Covid-19. \n Mr Gan said some people have noted that a few measures came with a short time span, such as the three-month period for the Jobs Support Scheme to help companies retain workers, but the Government has around S$8 billion more up its sleeve in accumulated surpluses during the current term of government. This\u00a0kitty could be used to \u201cpush up\u201d the economy if needed, he said. \n SINGAPOREANS HAVE TO FACE A \u2018SLOW-BURN\u2019 CRISIS \n On how the people here have reacted, Dr Soon and Dr Jayakumar said that Singaporeans need to be able to prepare emotionally for health pandemics, which Dr Jayakumar described as a \u201cslow-burn\u201d crisis. \n Dr Soon noted that three types of misinformation emerged during this outbreak. These are factual misinformation, such as the false rumours of MRT station closures; misleading advisories such as unproven home remedies being shared online; and xenophobic, racist sentiments that have no basis in fact, which are observed both overseas and in Singapore. \n She said that Singapore has been effective in trying to plug information gaps about the virus through \u201ca very interesting and relatively efficacious playbook\u201d.\u00a0 \n Besides daily updates about the spread of the virus, the Government reinforces key messages through different channels, such as through various government ministries, the media, and experts to help people dissect the situation. \n It has also wielded the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (Pofma) to counter Covid-19 falsehoods in a way that most people agree with, she said. \n Government spokespersons were also quick to counter rumours, she added, noting how Health Minister Gan Kim Yong had come out at one point to categorically refute talk that the authorities were going to raise the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition from Orange level to Red. \n Still, more can be done, she said. While the Government has been providing updates usually at a certain time each day, on some days, the information may arrive later in the evening. This may create suspicions, Dr Soon said. \n \u201cWhere there is an information gap, people will rely on heuristics \u2014 mental shortcuts \u2014 to plug the gaps,\u201d she added.\u00a0 \n Dr Jayakumar said that while Singapore is prepared for one-off incidents such as terrorist attacks, the Government, academics and think-tanks should do more to look at how the country can bounce back from slow-burn crises such as pandemics and climate change. \n \u201cIn my point of view, it is almost problematic that Singapore is so safe, clean and secure. It is not normal... it is supernormal, because almost nothing of note, security-wise, seems to happen in Singapore.\u00a0 \n \u201cNow we have to accept that these things may be there for a long time,\u201d Dr Jayakumar said."}, {"content": "Rush is real: How world leaders are trying to fight corona-triggered recession fears.

This factor could also cost German GDP 0.2 percentage points in the first quarter, so a technical recession in the winter semester, which includes the fourth quarter of last year and the first of this year, seems possible. A technical recession occurs when the economy contracts two quarters in a row. Last year, the German economy avoided a technical recession by achieving slight growth in the third quarter, after a decline in GDP in the second.

This mainly focuses on restricting business travel, using teleconferencing and social media for daily activity, and asking workers to stay home whenever they have been out of the country for the past two weeks. It is the multinationals with headquarters or presence in Portugal that, due to their size, already have more concrete measures in the field, according to responses collected in writing by P\u00daBLICO from 14 companies and two sectoral organisations. In Switzerland, Nestl\u00e9, the world&#39;s largest food group with two factories in the country, was asked &quot;all employees not to travel internationally for work in the next three weeks, specifically between 25 February and 15 March&quot;. At the largest Portuguese distribution company, Jer\u00f3nimo Martins, which recalls that in the three markets in which it operates (Portugal, Poland and Colombia) &quot;there is, so far, no confirmed case of coronavirus&quot;, the restrictions are, for now, located geographically, with emphasis on the area where the first cases arose. \u201cSince the beginning of the coronavirus crisis, in the Jer\u00f3nimo Martins group, professional travel to Asia was prohibited, and personal travel was also discouraged\u201d. EDP, whose largest shareholder is China Three Gorges, \u201cadvises employees to avoid traveling to China, and to countries/areas where there are active Covid-19 transmission communities\u201d. In the case of the oil company Galp, &quot;all trips planned for the currently affected areas are suspended&quot;, in addition to being &quot;restricted to cases of strict necessity&quot;, recognizing the company led by Carlos Gomes da Silva that &quot;will continue to monitor the evolution of the situation and to evaluate eventual adjustments of the adopted measures\u201d. By the same measure, the multinational Vodafone advances that &quot;all [professional trips] that are not urgent will be postponed.&quot; The telecommunications operator \u201calso recommends that travel to risky destinations be avoided\u201d in the case of personal travel by its workers.

The Super Bock Group, which in recent years has included China in the list of its main export markets, advises against not only &quot;moving to destinations with restrictions imposed by official entities, as well as &quot;physical&quot; meetings and close contact with people from the identified areas in Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and Japan. At the telecommunications operator Altice, it was decided to \u201cpostpone non-essential air travel, in particular to the Asian continent\u201d with \u201cair travel to countries with identified cases\u201d being all subject to the risk/benefit analysis\u201d. \u201cAt the beginning of February 2020\u201d, underlines an official source from the telecommunications group with a presence in several markets, \u201ca communication was made to the management teams of Altice Portugal with preventive information and guidelines, to be disseminated throughout the organization\u201d. And, \u201csince then, a contingency plan has been drawn up that is constantly being updated\u201d. Also earlier this month, the Super Bock Group created \u201can internal commission with medical supervision to monitor this situation\u201d. \u201cIncluded in the group&#39;s Occupational Medicine support\u201d, clarifies the brewer&#39;s official source, \u201ca specific medical contact was designated to which employees should channel any questions or information, via email or telephone\u201d.

The Fidelidade insurance group, held 85% by the Chinese conglomerate Fosun and 15% by CGD, guarantees that \u201cit has drawn up a Contingency Plan to respond to the Covid-19 viral outbreak, which complements the Business Continuity Plan that the company has permanently prepared to respond to any adverse scenario, in which a scenario of a viral outbreak is also included\u201d. REN \u2013 which emphasizes that \u201cit prioritizes the safety of all employees and safeguards the management of critical operations under its responsibility, such as the management of national electricity and natural gas transport systems\u201d \u2013 states that it is \u201cmonitoring the evolution of the situation since the beginning in coordination with the official entities\u201d, following the recommendations of the DGS. &quot;All employees are aware of the importance of adopting prevention measures, having access to internal and external channels to clarify doubts and obtain additional information&quot;.

In the case of FIPA \u2013 Federation of Portuguese Agro-Food Industries, explains Pedro Queiroz, director general of the organization: \u201cwe do not have any trip planned to the most affected countries\u201d. \u201cRight now, the Federation is carrying out all its work within the normal range and without canceling any national or international commitment\u201d. In addition to the preventive measures to prevent their employees from traveling to destinations more or less exposed to the new coronavirus, most companies chose to ask employees that, having traveled - mainly because of the &quot;bridge&quot; that the day of Carnival, the February 25th, allowed \u2013 opt for the simplest. Staying at home and resorting to telecommuting. In the case of Vodafone, \u201cemployees must proactively inform their direct supervisor of personal trips abroad that they have taken recently or are planned, identifying any stopovers\u201d in countries where they have traveled.

At Sumol+Compal, \u201cemployees who travel on vacation to risky destinations must inform Human Resources and comply with the provisions of the Contingency Plan\u201d, with the situation being \u201creviewed and reviewed every week\u201d. At the former Unicer, \u201cany employee, family member or person close to him/her who has traveled in the last few days\u201d to China, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and Iran \u201ctake specific measures to contact our indicated doctor, in order to be able to carry out the proper monitoring of the clinical status and to rule out any possible incubation\u201d. If they have traveled to other destinations, &quot;namely passing through airports, the additional recommendation is that workers &quot;make sure that all members of the group in their vicinity are in good health and without any symptoms that could be associated with this disease&quot; . Similar solution is being applied in the JM group. &quot;Since Italy is now considered a focus country&quot;, employees returning from this or any country considered to be a focus must stay working from home until the period considered necessary to ensure that the person is not infected has expired.&quot; &quot;We will take the necessary additional measures, as the situation evolves,&quot; adds an official source from the owner of Pingo Doce. &quot;Situations in which there is the integration of people returning from a trip to China, or from countries that appear on the list issued by the ECDC [European Center for Disease Prevention and Control], must be included in a distance work regime during a period of two weeks, and the return to the EDP premises should only take place if symptoms of cough, fever or breathing difficulties do not appear during this period\u201d. Altice will also carry out \u201csurveillance and support for employees returning from infected areas\u201d and resort to \u201cthe teleworking regime\u201d. At BCP, whenever possible and \u201cas is already the practice at the bank\u201d, says an official source, \u201cvideoconference meetings are favored\u201d in a context of restriction on air travel. &quot;Alternative methods of communication, such as Skype or the telepresence communication system&quot;, which exist in all the markets in which it operates, is what Nestl\u00e9 chooses in place of &quot;professional domestic travel&quot; and recommends &quot;to all employees&quot; . &quot;On the other hand&quot;, adds an official source from Nestl\u00e9 Portugal, the fact that today it is a company &quot;that has implemented more agile and flexible work practices&quot; allows its employees to &quot;work from any location, including from their homes if they deem it necessary \u201d. The Swiss food company, however, does not report any impact on activity with the outbreak of the new coronavirus locally. &quot;In the case of Nestl\u00e9 Portugal, we do not see any constraint at the level of our &#39;supply chain&#39; [supply chain], nor at the level of our exports&quot;. Beverage manufacturer Sumol+Compal guarantees that \u201cit is not possible, at this moment, to measure or correlate any variation in activity with the coronavirus outbreak\u201d. Globally, the Super Bock Group does not advance impacts yet. \u201cWe are, above all, monitoring the situation due to the global dimension it is having\u201d. In the specific case of the Chinese market, says an official source, &quot;it is premature to assess the impact on the operation, considering that exports to China, in January and February, are, as a rule, milder as it is a time of year with warmer temperatures low and also because there were relevant orders in November and December to safeguard festivities such as the Chinese New Year\u201d, this year celebrated on the 25th of January. FIPA, the federation to which the three groups belong, believes \u201cthat the majority of companies [in the agri-food and beverage sector] are operating normally\u201d. Pedro Queiroz recognizes that &quot;it is still premature to make any assessment of this type&quot;, and recalls that &quot;although it is a highly attractive market, China still represents just over 1% of customers and suppliers in the agri-food sector&quot;. Conclusion? \u201cIt is not possible to ascertain a significant impact on the sector\u201d. From distribution comes a similar answer: \u201cthe Portuguese Association of Distribution Companies (APED) has not registered, so far, any changes to the normal functioning of commercial spaces of its members\u201d. \u201cBoth consumption and supply are taking place with complete normality\u201d, guarantees the association that brings together hyper and supermarkets and brands with Ikea and Fnac. JM, specifically, says that it does not register \u201cany impact\u201d: \u201cin relation to China, we have no exposure to food imports and with regard to non-food products, imports are also very low\u201d. EDP, present in various geographies, says that &quot;so far there has been no impact on the normal functioning of the various companies in the group&quot;. In tourism, Vila Gal\u00e9 assures: \u201cso far we have not detected any impact of the coronavirus on reservations\u201d of the second largest Portuguese hotel chain. CTT, in turn, guarantees that &quot;export and import flows to China are open and uninterrupted&quot;, but admit that &quot;they have seen a reduction in the supply of transport and a change in the normality of Chinese economic activity, due to the slowdown in the local economy\u201d. Vodafone responds that &quot;at this stage there is no impact of the coronavirus on the activity&quot; of the telecommunications operator in Portugal and when asked about China as a customer and/or supplier, it guaranteed that &quot;it is closely following the evolution of the situation, together with manufacturers and suppliers, in order to minimize the impacts that may exist in their business\u201d.

The Wuhan coronavirus continues its rapid spread across China. The fatalities already number 81 and those infected reach 2,762, almost 800 more than 24 hours earlier. More than 30,000 people remain under observation, of which 5,794 are suspected of being infected with the pathogen. The authorities, who had already warned that the virus infection capacity is being strengthened, have recognized that one of the weak points of control is the extensive rural areas, to which millions of emigrants from urban areas have returned during the festivities of the lunar new year. This Monday the first death from the new disease was announced in Beijing. Since last Saturday Chinese President Xi Jinping convened the highest command body in the country, the Standing Committee of the Communist Party Politburo, to order that no cost be repaired to tackle the crisis, Beijing wants to make it clear that it is moving heaven and earth to get it. This Monday, Prime Minister Li Keqiang, who is at the forefront of coordinating efforts, landed in Wuhan, the city of 11 million people at the epicenter of the crisis. According to the State Council, the Chinese Executive, in a brief statement, Li visited the city&#39;s hospitals and supervised prevention and control work. In recent days, medical centers had warned that their stocks of protective material were running low and had launched requests for donations to the public. The Chinese government itself had admitted on Sunday problems to guarantee supply, although it had also insisted that it will mobilize domestic factories and turn to international distributors to fill the gap as soon as possible. In the daily press conference of the National Health Commission - another of the measures to demonstrate transparency in the management of the crisis - He Qinghua, senior manager of the Center for Disease Prevention and Control, has warned that one of the Big challenges to limit the spread of the virus are found in rural areas. The New Year season has seen tens of millions of migrants in urban areas have returned to their places of origin to be reunited with their families. \u201cAwareness (of the coronavirus) is relatively low in those areas. We have to cover that vulnerable point, \u201dsaid the senior official. To achieve this, he affirmed, the local Communist Party cadres and neighborhood committees will be mobilized in each community. Hours earlier, the mayor of Wuhan, Zhou Xianwang, had acknowledged that five million people had left the city before the quarantine that has been blocked since last Thursday at 10 a.m. it has ended up extending to a fortnight more nearby towns with a total population of 46 million. One of the priorities now is to locate these people so that they are quarantined and avoid spreading the virus, if they are carriers. Meanwhile, the governments of several Western countries continue talks with Beijing to evacuate its citizens trapped in Wuhan, where about twenty Spaniards remain. The Japanese government has indicated this Monday that it hopes to charter, possibly this very Tuesday, a plane to repatriate its more than 500 compatriots in that city. The Chinese authorities have recommended that travel be limited as much as possible and that crowds be avoided, to avoid contagion. Among other measures, it has declared a holiday this week to postpone the largest &quot;return operation&quot; in the world after the New Year, in which 400 million trips are estimated.

After all, what is the impact of travel restrictions on the transmission of the new coronavirus? A team of scientists from the United States, Italy and China estimated the impacts of the spread of covid-19 after the quarantine was carried out in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic. The result: travel restrictions have a \u201cmodest\u201d impact on the spread of the new coronavirus. Public health measures and behavioral changes, such as early case detection and hand washing, are more effective. The team coordinated by scientist Matteo Chinazzi, from the University of the Northeast (USA), used a covid-19 transmission model called the \u201cGlobal Epidemic and Mobility Model (GLEAM)\u201d. The results had already been released on the health sciences research portal MedRxiv and were published this Friday in the scientific journal Science. And there are three big conclusions. First, it was realized that the travel ban in Wuhan on 23 January 2020 delayed the epidemic across mainland China from three to five days. In other words, it had a \u201cmodest\u201d effect.

Then, when in early February airlines canceled flights to and from China, those restrictions helped to slow the spread of the epidemic around the world. However, this effect was also modest. \u201cEven when there were 90% reductions in travel, the number of cases imported into other countries increased significantly in a matter of weeks\u201d, reads a summary of the article. Finally, the team points out that even in the presence of severe travel restrictions in China and abroad, a large number of individuals already exposed to the new coronavirus traveled around the world undetected. These results could be a contribution for scientists, medical teams and politicians to fight the epidemic. &quot;In the future, we hope that travel restrictions on covid-19 in the affected areas will have modest effects, and that interventions to reduce transmission will yield large benefits to mitigate the epidemic,&quot; the authors write in the article."}, {"content": "Confusion and lost time: how testing woes slowed China's coronavirus response. BEIJING (Reuters) - Yang Zhongyi was still waiting on Monday for a coronavirus test in the Chinese city of Wuhan two weeks after she started to show signs of a fever, even though doctors privately told her family that she almost certainly has been infected, her son Zhang Changchun told Reuters.\nYang, 53, is just one of many Wuhan inhabitants finding it difficult to get tested or receive treatment for the new form of coronavirus, which authorities say has infected 2,800 people and killed at least 80 in China, a situation that may be contributing to the spread of the disease.\nYang has been unable to gain full-time admission to a hospital, her son said. She has been put on drips in unquarantined areas at four separate hospitals in the city to treat her deteriorating lungs, he said, while he is doing what he can to get her tested or admitted full-time.\n\u201cMy brother and I have been queuing at the hospital every day. We go at 6 and 7 in the morning, and queue for the whole day, but we don\u2019t get any new answers,\u201d Zhang told Reuters. \u201cEvery time the responses are the same: \u2018There\u2019s no bed, wait for the government to give a notice, and follow the news to see what\u2019s going on.\u2019 The doctors are all very frustrated too.\u201d\nOfficially known as 2019-nCoV, the new form of coronavirus was first identified as the cause of death of a 61-year-old man in Wuhan on Jan. 10, when China shared gene information on the virus with other countries. Some, such as Japan and Thailand, started testing travelers from China for the virus within three days.\nHowever, testing kits for the disease were not distributed to some of Wuhan\u2019s hospitals until about Jan. 20, an official at the Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Hubei CDC) told Reuters. Before then, samples had to be sent to a laboratory in Beijing for testing, a process that took three to five days to get results, according to Wuhan health authorities.\nDuring that gap, hospitals in the city reduced the number of people under medical observation from 739 to just 82, according to data compiled by Reuters from Wuhan health authorities, and no new cases were reported inside China.\nDespite the lack of reliable data and testing capacity in Wuhan, Chinese authorities assured citizens in the days after the virus had been identified that it was not widely transmissible. In previous weeks, it had censored negative online commentary about the situation, and arrested eight people it accused of being \u201crumor spreaders.\u201d\n\u201cThe doctor didn\u2019t wear a mask, we didn\u2019t know how to protect ourselves... no one told us anything,\u201d a 45-year-old woman surnamed Chen told Reuters. Her aunt was confirmed to have the virus on Jan. 20, five days after she was hospitalized. \u201cI posted my aunt\u2019s photos on (Chinese social media site) Weibo and the police called the hospital authorities. They told me to take it down.\u201d\nNational, regional and city health officials did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters on how the virus outbreak has been handled. National officials did say at a media briefing last week that there were some \u201cloopholes\u201d in initial treatment methods.\nWuhan\u2019s mayor, Zhou Xianwang, told Chinese state television on Monday he recognized that \u201call parties were not satisfied with the disclosure of our information.\u201d But he pointed to strictures placed upon him by provincial and national leaders.\n\u201cIn local governance, after I receive information, I can only release it when I\u2019m authorized,\u201d he said. Zhou told a media briefing on Sunday that a further 1,000 people could be diagnosed with the virus in Wuhan, based on the number of patients yet to be tested.\nChina last week locked down the affected region in Hubei province in the biggest quarantine operation on record and is building two new hospitals to treat virus patients. President Xi Jinping has created a special committee to tackle the outbreak.\nThe country has been praised internationally for quickly sequencing the virus gene. However, its slow scale-up of testing has been questioned.\nOnce a virus has been identified, \u201cYou need to make sure you have all the reagent (a substance used in chemical analysis) samples and you\u2019ve got it all pushed out to where you want to do testing,\u201d said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, who focuses on emerging infectious disease and pandemic preparedness.\nAlthough information from the region is scarce, Adalja suggested China has had problems with this stage of tackling the outbreak. \u201cWe\u2019re already hearing that there are shortages of medical professionals there, that there are shortages of test kits and medicines,\u201d he said.\nJohn Edmunds, a professor at the center for mathematical modeling of infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said China has not communicated enough detailed data after the initial outbreak.\n\u201cWe have a very incomplete picture of what\u2019s going on,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cWhether it\u2019s incompetence, secrecy, or deliberate, I don\u2019t know, but it would be very useful if we could have some basic epidemiological data.\u201d\nThe shortage of testing supplies and China\u2019s initial reticence have drawn criticism that the country is still learning lessons from the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002 that killed almost 800 people.\n\u201cThe improvements have been on the hard science side - figuring out the virus\u2019s genome, building new hospitals at a moment\u2019s notice - more than on the soft science side of managing information and dealing with people,\u201d said Mary Gallagher, a political science professor who leads the University of Michigan\u2019s Center for Chinese Studies.\nCity managers had little incentive to escalate problems to political superiors. The week in which no new virus cases were reported in Hubei coincided with preparations for the Lunar New Year and sessions of the province\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress and the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference.\nSeven of the largest hospitals in Wuhan are now equipped with testing kits for the virus, which in theory deliver results within a day, the Hubei CDC official said.\nBut four people told Reuters they were refused tests because the process involved a complex reporting system including hospital, district and city health authorities and disease control officials.\nTo qualify for the test, patients need to meet certain criteria, such as having symptoms of fever and pneumonia, and a surge in patients means it is \u201cimpossible to conduct the test right away,\u201d an official at the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention told Reuters.\nThree hospital and local government workers, who have been briefed on how doctors are handling tests and confirming cases, told Reuters that official numbers of infections and deaths do not reflect the actual toll.\nWuhan health authorities have a limit on tests, chiefly because of the shortage of testing kits, and are screening lists of patients before deciding who gets a test, which takes several hours, one hospital worker told Reuters.\n\u201cSome severely ill patients were left out from the final list for testing because they know they wouldn\u2019t be able to be treated,\u201d the worker told Reuters. \u201cThe actual deaths were higher.\u201d\nReuters could not independently confirm the hospital worker\u2019s account. Hubei and Wuhan health authorities did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.\nZhang, whose mother is still waiting for a test, said doctors at three Wuhan hospitals told her family privately that they are almost certain she has contracted the coronavirus.\nHowever, he said two of those hospitals told him they are not equipped with testing kits, and the other told him it has no available bed to accommodate his mother for the test.\nNone of those hospitals replied to Reuters requests for comment.\nSixty-nine year-old Xu Enen, who has had fever and a lung infection since Jan. 8, was rejected by six hospitals in Wuhan for testing as they said they had ran out of beds, his daughter told Reuters. Xu\u2019s symptoms have worsened lately, and he is starting to have breathing difficulties.\nHe was finally admitted on Jan. 22 to queue for the test at Hankou hospital in Wuhan after his daughter publicized his case on Weibo.\nResearchers at Lancaster University estimate that only 5.1% of infections in Wuhan have been identified. By Jan. 21, they estimated a total of 11,341 people had been infected in Wuhan since the start of the year. More than 30,000 people in Wuhan are under observation, according to the city\u2019s health authorities.\n\u201cAll we want is to confirm the case is the virus or not,\u201d said a 33-year-old Wuhan woman surnamed Liu, whose father has been on a respirator in hospital since Jan. 14 and was still untested on Monday. \u201cAt least if it\u2019s confirmed we have a direction. If there\u2019s no direction, there\u2019s no hope.\u201d"}, {"content": "Social distancing due to coronavirus: Satellite data suggest no large-scale decrease in emissions in India. The outbreak of the novel coronavirus, or Covid-19, has forced countries across the world to take extreme steps - one of these has been a complete lockdown of cities.\nBoth China and Italy adopted these extreme measures in order to contain the outbreak once it went out of control.

Although, the situation in India is nowhere similar to that in China or Europe, these governments along with those of the UK and USA have been criticised for not taking similar measures sooner.\nWhen it comes to the novel coronavirus outbreak, the global science community has reached a consensus that no step is enough and preemptive measures are more effective in these situations.\nWhile experts world over are advising the governments to take more drastic measures to contain the outbreak into new areas, large-scale isolation and absence of public gatherings have shown effective results."}, {"content": "WRAPUP 11-China reports big rise in coronavirus deaths, WHO sees no 'tip of iceberg'. BEIJING/TOKYO (Reuters) - The Chinese province at the center of the coronavirus outbreak reported a record rise in deaths and thousands more infections using a broader definition on Thursday, while Japan became the third place outside mainland China to suffer a fatality.\nThe epidemic has given China\u2019s ruling Communist Party one of its sternest challenges in years, constrained the world\u2019s second largest economy and triggered a purge of provincial bureaucrats.\nWith China\u2019s streets, restaurants and flower markets bare, a miserable Valentine\u2019s Day was expected on Friday.\nJapan confirmed its first coronavirus death - a woman in her 80s living in Kanagawa prefecture near Tokyo - adding to two previous fatalities in Hong Kong and the Philippines.

[MKTS/GLOB]\nBut it appeared largely due to the change in methodology.\nHubei had previously only allowed infections to be confirmed by RNA tests, which can take days. RNA, or ribonucleic acid, carries genetic information allowing identification of viruses.\nBut it has also begun using CT scans of lungs, the Hubei health commission said, to pinpoint and isolate cases faster.\nAs a result, another 14,840 new cases were reported in the province on Thursday, up from 2,015 new cases nationwide a day earlier. But excluding cases confirmed using the new methods, the number of new cases rose by only 1,508.\nAbout 60,000 people have been infected in total, the vast majority of them in China.\nThe outbreak, believed to have emerged from a Wuhan market where wildlife was traded illegally, has triggered a backlash against local political leaders.\nProvincial Communist Party boss Jiang Chaoliang was fired as secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee, and Ma Guoqiang removed as party chief in Wuhan, state media said. They were the two highest-profile officials to be axed since the outbreak.\nChinese scientists are testing two antiviral drugs and preliminary results are weeks away, although WHO chiefs have cautioned a vaccine could take 18 months.\nWhile the Princess Diamond cruise liner remained in quarantine, another luxury liner, the MS Westerdam, was finally allowed to dock in Cambodia after being barred from Guam, Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand over fears that one of its 1,455 passengers and 802 crew might have the virus - even though none had tested positive.\nThe Westerdam\u2019s passengers clapped and cheered on their arrival at sunset."}, {"content": "False claim: 5G networks are making people sick, not Coronavirus. Facebook users have been sharing posts claiming 5G, not the coronavirus, is making people sick (  here  ).\nThe posts go on to include a list of various further claims that deny the reality of the virus and include various conspiracy-type arguments about the coronavirus.\nThe coronavirus outbreak started in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The Center for Disease Control says on its website the virus had links to a \"seafood\u00a0and live animal market\" where a human might have contracted the virus from an animal. The virus then spread person-to-person (  here  ). The symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, tiredness, cough, and shortness of breath that can appear  two to 14 days after being exposed to the virus (  here  ). The coronavirus is spread person-to-person (  here  ).\nMobile phones use radio waves. They send and receive radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF EMFs).\u00a05G uses \"beam-forming technology\", which allows radiofrequency electromagnetic fields to go directly where needed (  here  ).\nThe International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) after 7 years of research released 2020 guidelines on limiting exposure to electromagnetic fields.\u00a0They\u00a0include information about 5G.\nThe commission says the main effect that radiofrequency electromagnetic fields have on the human body is increased temperature of exposed tissue. The body can handle small increases to body temperature, such as through exercising, but radiofrequency exposure and increased temperature can be dangerous above a certain threshold (  here  ).\nAccording to the ICNIRP,\u00a0\"Another general characteristic of RF EMFs is that the higher the frequency, the lower the depth of penetration of the EMFs into the body. As 5G technologies can utilize higher EMF frequencies (>24 GHz) in addition to those currently used (<4 GHz), power from those higher frequencies will be primarily absorbed more superficially than that from previous mobile telecommunications technologies [\u2026] Accordingly, 5G exposures will not cause any harm providing that they adhere to the ICNIRP (2020) guidelines\" (  here  ).\nEric van Rongen, Chairman of ICNIRP, said in a video that there is no evidence that electromagnetic fields cause health effects such as cancer, electrohypersensitivity, infertility or anything else. The only two recognized health effects are nerve stimulation in up to 10 MHz and heating from 100 kHz (  here  ).\nThe World Health Organization says no research has linked exposure to wireless technology with negative health effects (  here  ).

Ziskin, Professor Emeritus of Radiology and Medical Physics, said there is no basis to expect that 5G would cause adverse health issues provided\u00a0exposure limits are respected.\nZiskin told Reuters, \u201cThe weight of scientific evidence indicates that 5G emissions are not cumulative.\u00a0That is, multiple exposures of innocuous exposures do not add to produce any adverse biological effect.\u00a0I would add that there have been no health agency warnings about possible health risks of RF energy including millimeter waves at exposure levels that an average consumer would experience from communications technology.\u00a0This is consistent with assessments of the issue by standards-setting groups such as IEEE and ICNIRP.\u201d\nCoronavirus symptoms can be found in detail on official government and international health organization sites.

Accordingly, we have revised our growth forecasts to 5.4 per cent for 2020 and 5.8 per cent for 2021, down from our previous projections of 6.6 per cent\u00a0and 6.7 per cent respectively,\" Moody's said.\nMoody's growth projections are based on calendar year and as per its estimates, India's GDP grew 5 per cent in 2019.\nThe rating agency had in November 2019 projected India\u2019s economic growth in 2020 and 2021 at 6.6 per cent and 6.7 per cent respectively.\nIn its latest update, Moody's said the reduction in India's growth rate reflects domestic challenges rather than external factors.\nStating that the key to stronger economic momentum would be the revival of domestic demand and bank credit growth, Moody's said the Union Budget 2020 did not contain a significant stimulus to address the demand slump.\nWith a weak economy and depressed credit growth reinforcing each other, Moody's said, \"It is difficult to envision a quick turnaround of either, even if economic deceleration may have troughed.\"\n\"As similar policies in other countries have shown, tax cuts are unlikely to translate into higher consumer and business spending when risk aversion is high,\" Moody's said.\n\nThe rating agency said it expects additional easing by the Reserve Bank.\nHowever, if the recent rise in CPI inflation, mainly as a result of higher food prices, is seen to have second-round effects, this would make it more challenging for the central bank to cut interest rates further, it added.\nThe RBI has lowered the repo rate by a cumulative 135 bps in 2019.\nInflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose to a 68-month-high of 7.59 per cent in January.\nRBI's mandated target range for retail inflation is 2-6 per cent and the central bank aims to keep it at 4 per cent over the medium term.\nMoody's said that resumption of credit growth is equally important as reviving demand, and banks have been reluctant to lend or lower lending rates despite successive rate cuts by the RBI.\n\"...credit impulse in the economy has deteriorated throughout the last year as a result of the drying up of lending from non-bank financial institutions as well as from banks,\" Moody's said.\nIt said the deterioration in credit growth to the commercial sector is particularly \u201cstark\u201d.\nNominal credit to industry grew at only 1.6 per cent year-on-year in December 2019, while credit to the services sector registered 6.2 per cent\u00a0nominal growth, and credit to agriculture and related activities grew 5.3 per cent, it added.\nWith regard to global growth, Moody's said coronavirus outbreak has diminished optimism about prospects of an incipient stabilisation of global growth this year.\nGlobal\u00a0GDP growth forecast has been revised down, and Moody's now expects G-20 economies to collectively grow 2.4 per cent in 2020, a softer rate than last year, followed by a pick up to 2.8 per cent \u00a0in 2021.\n\"We have reduced our growth forecast for China to 5.2 per cent in 2020 and maintain our expectation of 5.7 per cent growth in 2021,\" it added.\nMoody's expects that the\u00a0spread of coronavirus will be contained by the end of March, and normal economic activity would resume in April-June quarter.\n\"At present, China's economy is by far the worst affected. However, the rest of the world also has exposure as a result of a hit to global tourism in the first half of this year and short-term disruptions to supply chains,\" it said.\n\"The effects on the global economy could compound if the rate of infection does not abate and the death toll continues to rise, because supply chain disruptions in manufacturing would become more acute the longer it takes to restore normalcy,\" Moody's added.\nThe death toll from China's coronavirus epidemic rose to over 1,660, with over 68,500 confirmed cases.\nThe coronavirus outbreak originated in central China's Hubei province in December last year and has spread to several countries.\nMany countries have banned arrivals from China, while major airlines have suspended flights to the country."}, {"content": "Businesses in faraway Namibia feel coronavirus fear.

Genetic study confirms that transmission to humans will originate from wild animals. A genetic study released on Wednesday confirms that the new coronavirus originating in China has been transmitted to humans through an as-yet-unknown wild animal that was infected by bats. The study, conducted by Chinese scientists including from the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, analyzed the coronavirus genome of nine patients diagnosed with viral pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, where the outbreak began in December. The work, published in the British medical publication The Lancet and which validates in the laboratory a thesis assumed by experts, suggests that the new coronavirus, provisionally designated by the World Health Organization as &quot;2019-nCoV&quot;, had as its initial host a bat and was transmitted to people through an as-yet-unknown wild animal that was sold at the Huanan live animal market in Wuhan, capital of Hubei province in central China. Although cautiously, the study authors admit that the new coronavirus is not the result of a genetic mutation of another coronavirus, but may have entered human cells in the same way as the coronavirus that caused the also identified Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). for the first time in China, in 2002 and 2003. The researchers analyzed genome samples (genetic information) of &quot;2019-nCoV&quot; - eight complete sequences and two partial - collected from the nine patients with viral pneumonia. Eight of the patients attended the Huanan market, the rest stayed in a nearby hotel before falling ill. According to the scientific team, the samples of the genetic sequences are almost identical, so the coronavirus would have emerged in humans very recently and was quickly detected. China today raised to 132 dead and more than 5,900 infected the balance of victims of the new coronavirus identified at the end of the year in Wuhan. In addition to the mainland of China, cases of infection have been reported in Macau, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, United States, Singapore, Vietnam, Nepal, Malaysia, Australia, Canada, Germany, France, Finland and the Emirates United Arabs. The World Health Organization today decided to reconvene, on Thursday, the Emergency Committee to determine whether the outbreak of the new coronavirus should be an international public health emergency."}, {"content": "US slashed CDC staff inside China prior to coronavirus outbreak. WASHINGTON (REUTERS) - The Trump administration cut staff by more than two-thirds at a key United States public health agency operating inside China, as part of a larger rollback of US-funded health and science experts on the ground there leading up to the coronavirus outbreak, Reuters has learnt. \n Most of the reductions were made at the Beijing office of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and occurred over the past two years, according to public CDC documents viewed by Reuters and interviews with four people familiar with the drawdown. \n The Atlanta-based CDC, America's pre-eminent disease fighting agency, provides public health assistance to nations around the world and works with them to help stop outbreaks of contagious diseases from spreading globally. It has worked in China for 30 years. \n The CDC's China headcount has shrunk to around 14 staff members, down from approximately 47 people since President Donald Trump took office in January 2017, the documents show. The four people, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the losses included epidemiologists and other health professionals. \n The material reviewed by Reuters shows a breakdown of how many American and local Chinese employees were assigned there. \n The documents are the CDC's own descriptions of its headcount, which it posts online. Reuters was able to search past copies of the material to confirm the decline described by the four people. \n \"The CDC office in Beijing is a shell of its former self,\" said one of the people, a US official who worked in China at the time of the drawdown. \n Separately, the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the global relief programme which had a role in helping China monitor and respond to outbreaks, also shut their Beijing offices on Mr Trump's watch. Before the closures, each office was staffed by a US official. In addition, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) transferred\u00a0the manager of an animal disease monitoring programme out of China in 2018. \n Reductions at the US agencies sidelined health experts, scientists and other professionals who might have been able to help China mount an earlier response to the novel coronavirus, as well as provide the US government with more information about what was coming, according to the people who spoke with Reuters. The Trump administration in February chastised China for censoring information about the outbreak and for keeping US experts from entering the country to assist. \n \"We had a large operation of experts in China who were brought back during this administration, some of them months before the outbreak,\" said one of the people who witnessed the withdrawal of US personnel. \"You have to consider the possibility that our drawdown made this catastrophe more likely or more difficult to respond to.\" \n The White House declined to comment or respond to questions from Reuters regarding the US withdrawal of staff in China. \n The CDC did not respond to detailed questions submitted by Reuters about the cuts. It has insisted its staffing levels did not hinder the US response to the coronavirus. \n \"There are many factors that go into decisions around staffing,\" the CDC said in a statement. \n Some health experts were sceptical that more CDC employees operating inside China would have made a difference in stemming the outbreak. Beijing has been widely criticised for silencing its own public health officials who warned of a deadly new respiratory disease emanating from the Chinese city of Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province. \n \"The problem was China, not that we didn't have CDC people in China,\" said Dr Scott McNabb, a former CDC epidemiologist who is now a research professor with Emory University. He pointed to China's censorship as the main culprit in the spread of the pandemic, which has infected at least 435,470 people worldwide, killed 19,598 and upended the global economy. \n China's embassy in Washington, DC declined to comment. \n The NSF closed all foreign offices in 2018, according to spokesman Robert Margetta. He said the agency planned on \"sending teams on short-term expeditions around the world to find ways to increase international collaborations.\" \n A USAID spokesman said the decision to shutter its Beijing office was \"due to significantly decreased access to Chinese government officials as well as the Agency's position that the Chinese model of development is not aligned with US values and interests\". \n The USDA confirmed that it moved a manager position out of Beijing. A spokesman said the department has retained an office in China that employs eight people: five Americans and three Chinese. The office monitors animal disease and helps resolve \"trade-related issues as they occur at Chinese ports of entry,\" the spokesman said. \n Reuters first reported about changes to CDC staffing in China on Sunday. The news agency revealed that the Trump administration had eliminated the position of a US trainer of Chinese field epidemiologists, who were deployed to the epicentre of outbreaks to help track, investigate and contain diseases. \n In a press briefing on Sunday, Mr Trump criticised the Reuters story as \"100 per cent wrong\". Yet the CDC acknowledged the position had been cut. The agency said the decision was made because of China's \"excellent technical capability,\" and said the elimination of that post did not hamper the US effort to respond to the coronavirus outbreak. \n The CDC staffing documents newly reviewed by Reuters show a sharp decline in the overall number of employees at the agency in Beijing, with 33 out of 47 positions lost. \n The documents show the breakdown between American and Chinese staff members. The number of so-called American \"assignees\" declined to three positions from eight at the outset of the administration. Positions lost included medical epidemiologists and other experts in infectious diseases. \n The biggest cuts were to positions filled by Chinese employees on the US payroll, down to around 10 from 40 over the same period. Many of those local hires included medical and disease experts, according to the people who spoke with Reuters. \n \"Local staffers stayed even longer at the CDC and had a real depth of knowledge,\" one of the people said. \"There's a loss of deep expertise and institutional knowledge.\" \n The CDC told Reuters the three Americans currently on staff in China are a country director, an influenza expert and an information technology expert. A temporary deputy director arrived recently, and that job will be filled permanently, the agency said in a statement. In addition, two Chinese staffers continue to work on specific public health areas, including the training programme, according to the statement. \n The shuttered USAID and NSF offices in China also had a role in building scientific relationships and combating global disease, according to the four people familiar with the situation. \n USAID's Beijing office, which was staffed by a senior US officer and two Chinese employees, was working on initiatives including multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and malaria, the people said. The office closed in 2019. \n The NSF office was once led by Dr Nancy Sung, a respected American scientist who was a key link between the US and Chinese scientific communities, according to the US government official who spoke with Reuters. The office also employed two local staff members. \n \"She had far more contacts than most of us,\" said the official, who had been in China at the time and was familiar with her role. \"She could have helped maintain vital channels of communication between the two countries which to this day is greatly curtailed.\" \n Dr Sung, who is now with the NSF in the United States, declined to comment about the closure of her office in 2018 and referred questions to the agency's public affairs office. \n The changes came amid escalating tensions between Washington and Beijing. Mr Trump has long complained that China has stolen millions of American jobs and intellectual property, charges the Chinese government has rejected as baseless. The countries have slapped billions in tariffs on each other's goods. Now their leaders are battling to control the narrative over the pandemic. \n Mr Trump has called it the \"Chinese virus\" to keep the focus on China's role in unleashing the pandemic. China, meanwhile, is trying to assert global leadership by providing aid to Italy and other hard-hit countries. \n Over the last two years, the White House has pushed US agencies with a presence in China to de-fund programmes there along with the positions to manage them, according to the US official who spoke to Reuters. \n The source said Mr Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and a former Republican governor of Iowa, tried to remind the White House of the importance of the US presence in China but was told to \"get with the programme\" by an administration official. \n \"The White House saw the relationship as one-sided and without benefit to the US,\" the source said. \n A State Department spokesman said in a statement that the US Embassy in China is \"one of our largest, reflecting the many areas of bilateral engagement\". \n \"Since Ambassador Branstad's arrival, the US Mission to China has maintained robust staffing to advance important foreign policy goals on behalf of the American people,\" the statement said. \"Staffing levels for the numerous federal agencies and sections have, on the whole, held steady and in some cases increased.\" \n After Reuters' story about the elimination of the key CDC position in China ran on Sunday, Mr Trump's re-election campaign seized on it for fund raising. In a mass e-mail to supporters, it accused Mr Trump's critics of \"siding with the Chinese\" and helping Beijing with a \"cover-up\". \n The CDC on Monday told Reuters that its director Dr Robert Redfield had decided to add a global health threats programme director to its China staff. \n \"At the request of Dr Redfield, CDC is continuing to look long term at possible additions to enhance CDC's 30 plus year presence in China,\" the statement said."}, {"content": "India reports first case of Coronavirus; Kerala woman tests positive.

Study of positive coronavirus cases in two of the worst affected countries, China and Italy points to somewhat selective pattern of the spread of Covid-19. That the novel coronavirus targets the older people and avoids the young ones. \nSituation gets complicated leading to deaths if the elderly patient already has some medical issues such as breathing problems, diabetes, heart-related ailments and kidney problems. \nThe mean age of those succumbing to novel coronavirus in Italy was reported to be 81 last week. Italy is known as the country with old population; more than 60 per cent of its total population is over 40. This is said to have contributed to more infections and deaths in Italy than places such as South Korea or even Japan.\nChina too is considered a country of aging peopulation. This refers to share of elderly people (above 60) crossing 10 per cent in the total population. China's elderly (above 60) are more than 17 per cent in its total population. Incidentally in China, the Centre for Disease Control reached a similar conclusion as Italy after examining over 72,000 cases that the disease is deadlier in older people. This is also the conclusion of the World Health Organisation (WHO).\nIn India, all the three deaths due to novel coronavirus infection have happened in the cases of elderly patients. The youngest of them was 64. All had previous medical conditions.\nTwo main reasons have been attributed to this age specific coronavirus spread pattern. First, it is a medical fact that immunity is strongest in childhood and decreases with advancement in age. DNA, the genetic material that guides most functions of human body, is agile in childhood and responds quicker to alien particles entering the body. This boosts immunity. With advancement of age, the DNA messaging gets corrupted and the right message to disease fighting cells are not delivered efficiently.\nSecondly, in most countries, coronavirus testing are symptomatic in process. That is, only those showing synonyms are being tested for novel coronavirus infection. This means a number of children may be passing off without being tested for novel coronavirus. \nWith stronger immunity, children may not show symptoms of novel coronavirus infection even if they have contracted the contagion. Untested children means more adults entering the records and hence further skew in the final data.\nThis does not mean that children are completely immune to novel coronavirus infection. At two cases -- one each from China and the UK -- were reported about newborns having tested positive for novel coronavirus. Though, the disease Covid-19 has not been found to be transferring from mother to child during pregnancy. A three-year-old child tested positive for Covid-19 in India. She is the youngest Covid-19 patient in India.\nBut the fact that children are largely untested underscores that they can be carriers or vectors of novel coronavirus. Also, medical conditions like asthma and diabetes are not uncommon among children. In many cases obesity-linked diabetes and asthma are related. In such cases, novel coronavirus infection can be fatal for children."}, {"content": "Coronavirus in India: 44 infected so far, virus reaches Punjab, Karnataka and J&K | 10 developments.

Photo: Najeer Yusof/TODAY \n While many like Mr Tay understood the constraints and logistical challenges involved, as far as they are concerned, the takeaway was that they had great difficulty getting masks from retailers and ultimately, had to rely on a limited number given out by the Government.\u00a0 \n And even if supplies are in no danger of running out, Mr Tay argued that it would not hurt to be prepared.\u00a0 \n \u201cAnyway, if there\u2019s no emergency, we\u2019ll just take it as having done a few days\u2019 worth of shopping beforehand,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \n While Mr Tay and his mother had joined the hordes of shoppers at the supermarkets, their purchase was relatively\u00a0measured compared to the others: Pictures of shoppers with overflowing trolleys went viral, along with photographs and videos of empty vegetable and fruit baskets, and chillers devoid of meat.\u00a0 \u00a0 \n Still, some like Dr Paul Tambyah felt it was understandable why these shoppers behaved the way they did.\u00a0 \n Noting that Singapore, along with the rest of the world, would have to deal with the outbreak for the next several months, Dr Tambyah \u2013 who is president of the Asia-Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection \u2013 noted that in such a situation, it was practical to keep some essential supplies on standby in case one has to be put on quarantine, for instance.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \u201cAs far as I know, when a quarantine officer comes to put a person on quarantine, they do not let you go shopping at the supermarket first,\u201d he said. \n To allay public anxiety, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong made a speech a day after the panic buying, assuring Singaporeans that there was no need to panic as the city was not being locked down, and there was ample supply of food for everyone.\u00a0 \n Now that a sense of normalcy has returned, questions remain to be answered: What caused all that panic-buying over that fateful weekend, which had left some quarters fuming \u2014 and embarrassed \u2014 over the behaviour of \u201cugly Singaporeans\u201d, and others to question whatever happened to decades of efforts aimed at building a resilient society? \n And what does it say about Singaporeans, many of whom have stoically and quietly got on with their lives, despite the uncertainty and disruptions to daily life?\u00a0\u00a0 \n THE SITUATION ELSEWHERE \n As of Friday, Singapore has 67 confirmed cases of Covid-19 \u2014 the highest outside of China where the vast majority of cases are concentrated.\u00a0 \n Including Hong Kong and Macau, China has reported almost 64,000 cases to date and the count continues to rise.\u00a0 \n So far, apart from Singapore, there have been no reports of panic buying in places outside of China.\u00a0 Residents in Thailand for example, which has 33 confirmed cases as of Friday, told TODAY that the situation was calm and there has been no run on daily essentials.\u00a0 \n Some experts believe that events in Hong Kong, which was gripped by scenes of panic buying recently, had influenced Singaporeans\u2019 behaviour.\u00a0 \n Speaking to TODAY, Mr Wong Bai Chun, a Hong Kong citizen, said that two weeks ago, there was a brief but acute shortage of toilet paper and other paper goods in the territory, which was sparked by an Internet rumour that the Chinese spring holiday was being extended and there would be insufficient supplies of such products. \n Mr Wong said the fear over paper shortage had spread to other goods in Hong Kong. \u201cNow you can\u2019t find rice anywhere,\u201d said the 26-year-old who works in the finance industry. \n Unlike Macau or mainland China, there are no regulations in Hong Kong to curb such behaviours, he added. \n He said the panic buying and hoarding of daily essentials in Hong Kong stemmed from the shortage of disposable masks.\u00a0 \n \u201cAt the moment, people are sourcing their masks from all over the world and there\u2019s simply not enough,\u201d he said. \u201cHong Kong doesn\u2019t have the capacity to manufacture sufficient amounts of them.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Mr Wong Bai Chun, a Hong Kong citizen, told TODAY that the city folks started hoarding long before Singaporeans did. He said it all started with the shortage of disposable masks. Photo: Reuters \n While the panic-buying in Hong Kong mirrors what happened in Singapore, the similarity ends there. \n For one, there is no risk of Singapore running short of essential food and household items like toilet paper from short-term disruptions, such as the Covid-19 outbreak, said Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli. \n The country has managed to be resilient due to astute planning by the nation\u2019s food agencies and its well-connected transport network, he said on Feb 10 during the launch of the 2020 Singapore Food Story. The food security strategy aims to meet 30 per cent of the country\u2019s nutritional needs by 2030 using less than 1 per cent of its land area.\u00a0 \n On the evening of the panic buying in Singapore, Mr Seah Kian Peng, who is the chief executive of supermarket cooperative NTUC Fairprice, also assured the public that there were sufficient supplies of daily essentials in the warehouse.\u00a0 \n However, as experts pointed out, rationality and logic get cast aside\u00a0when panic sets in. \n \u201cResearch suggests that when people are in panic, the thinking part of our brain gets hijacked by the emotional system and we start to act illogically,\u201d said a spokesperson for the Singapore Psychological Society (SPS) council. \u201cOur ability to decide on our own is minimised.\u201d \n OTHER TRIGGERS \n Among the possible factors behind the panic buying was negativity bias where people\u2019s brains tend to focus more on negative information than positive ones, said the SPS spokesperson. \n \u201cOur brains are hardwired to register negative stimuli more readily and also to dwell and worry on them for a longer period of time,\u201d the spokesperson told TODAY. \n Furthermore, whenever there is a life-threatening epidemic or emergency, the notions of safety, protection, and self-preservation usually come into play.\u00a0 \n The spokesperson also noted people also tend to follow others in the hope that the latter could get them out of a dangerous situation.\u00a0 \n In Singapore\u2019s case, this could be a possible reason why people started to hoard or buy things impulsively if everyone else around them was doing the same, or if they were told to do so on social media platforms. \n This phenomenon of groupthink results in irrational and dysfunctional thinking and outcomes.\u00a0 \n \u201cIn this case, our brains focus more on the fear generated rather than on the reassurance given,\u201d said the spokesperson.\u00a0 \n Mr Lars Voedisch, the managing director of public relations firm PRecious Communications, said that such behaviour is triggered by one or two initial incidents which then get amplified by social media. \n \u201c(This leads) to a snowball effect of more and more people thinking of it, then hearing from the first people acting on their fear, sharing about it and through that fuelling the whole panic,\u201d he said. \n The images of empty shelves circulating on social media played a big part, said Singapore Management University sociologist Paulin Straughan. \u00a0 \u201cThis meant that people were no longer reacting to rumours that essentials might run out, but this new development itself,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich is: The shelves are empty. Better start to go now.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 \n  Shoppers at Fairprice Finest in Bukit Timah Plaza reaching out for toilet paper even before it got stocked in the shelves. Photo: Raj Nadarajan/TODAY \n Professor Straughan, whose research interests include medical sociology that encompasses infectious diseases, said it did not help that the public was seeing these images circulated on social media late in the night. As a result, these became the abiding images for many Singaporeans overnight.\u00a0 \n \u201cFor the next 12 hours, the shelves remain empty (in their minds),\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s 12 hours of festering, and it entrenches (the fear that there are no supplies).\u201d \n Agreeing with Mr Voedisch\u2019s observation about social media, Prof Straughan reiterated that while technology has helped to disseminate information a lot faster, it has similarly allowed misinformation to spread just as quickly as well. \n This was not something that Singaporeans had to worry about during the past virus outbreaks, she added. \n The SPS council spokesperson noted that when the Covid-19 virus was first made known, there was an overwhelming amount of news and social media coverage. \n \u201cWhen the Dorscon Orange was finally announced, it became a trigger tantamount to saying \u2018the coronavirus has arrived\u2019, resulting in the accompanying hoarding behaviour as response,\u201d the spokesperson said.\u00a0 \n Nanyang Technological University (NTU)\u00a0Professor May Oo Lwin, whose research interest at the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information (WKWSCI) includes strategic and health communications, said it is likely that the public was responding to certain levels of fear and stress that the deluge of messages had aroused.\u00a0\u00a0 \n She explained that scientists have pointed to a phenomenon where communication leading to fear and stressful emotions can cause unintended consequences.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Such messages, she said, needed to be concurrently countered with provision of strategies for coping with perceived threats.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \u201cIn this particular case, all the media information is likely to have induced strong emotive elements which were managed by some population segments by embracing these forms of rational or irrational, but culturally symbolic, behaviours,\u201d said Prof Lwin. \n In other words, some segments of the population \u201cmay undertake actions based around daily priorities to respond to their perceptions of the threat\u201d, said the health communications expert.\u00a0For example, in extreme cases of crisis like an earthquake, people could be seen taking their television sets while evacuating, she noted.\u00a0 \n That could explain why stacks of toilet paper were snapped up by Singaporeans during the panic buying.\u00a0Prof Straughan had another theory: They were relatively cheap and easy to hoard. \u201cWe all want to do something to make ourselves feel better,\u201d she quipped. \n PUBLIC COMMS \u2018COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER\u2019\u00a0 \n Communications experts told TODAY that the panic-buying in Singapore might have been avoided if the information disseminated by the authorities had been clearer.\u00a0 \n \u201cThe problem with the message was that it was too bureaucratic at the start,\u201d said Assistant Professor Liew Kai Khiun,\u00a0who teaches at NTU's WKWSCI. \u201cMuch of the Government\u2019s message involved military terms (and) colour codes.\" \n Prof Straughan agreed, noting that the definition of Dorscon Orange was not explained enough as well. \n Dorscon is a colour-coded framework that shows the current disease situation.\u00a0 \n Orange refers to a situation in which a virus is spreading in Singapore but not widely, and is being contained. Previously, the risk assessment level was at Yellow, signifying that the virus was severe and could infect from person to person, but was chiefly occurring outside Singapore. The highest level, Red, indicates that the virus is spreading widely and can result in major disruption such as closing schools. \n \u201cSome people didn\u2019t know what it meant. All they saw was the visual,\u201d said Prof Straughan. \u201cThere are four levels. Green, Yellow, Orange and Red. Red is bad, everybody knows that right? Green is good. Now Orange. It is closer to Red than it is to Green. So visually, it lights up all your flags.\u201d\u00a0 \n Asst Prof Liew pointed out while the message from the authorities was accurate, it did not cater to the layman. To that end, they could have used dialect or Singlish to reach out more effectively, he noted.\u00a0 \n During the Sars outbreak in 2003, local sitcom character Phua Chu Kang was used to educate Singaporeans on the importance of washing their hands.\u00a0 This, he said, was an effective way of reaching out to the public, and many people still remember it today. \n A leaked MOH press release a few hours before the official Dorscon Orange announcement, which left many befuddled, might have also fuelled the public panic.\u00a0 \n The press release was circulated on social media and through messaging platforms such as WhatsApp. \n Up till this incident, Prof Straughan felt that the Government had been doing well in being upfront with Singaporeans about the virus situation. But when the press release was prematurely leaked out, it created some confusion.\u00a0 \n She said it did not help that recipients of the leaked document were initially told by others that it was fake news, only to be informed by the authorities a few hours later that it was indeed true.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Such contradictory information would have led some to question if the authorities were trying to hide something, she said.\u00a0 \n The authorities have yet to announce the source of the leak, but Trade and Industry Minister Chan said on Feb 9 that the various agencies involved in tackling the virus will remind their staff that they have a professional responsibility not to prematurely share information that has not been finalised. \n Despite these short-comings in public communications,\u00a0some\u00a0experts\u00a0felt that Prime Minister Lee\u2019s nine-minute long speech on Feb 8 went some way in restoring a sense of normalcy. \n The SPS council spokesperson said Mr Lee\u2019s message gave people very concrete actions that \u201chanded back a measure of control to people whose sense of control felt threatened\u201d. \n Mr Voedisch of PRecious Communications said having the Prime Minister step in to address the public helped, because it went beyond technocratic statements and directly addressed what people were concerned with. \n \u201cWhile authorities should not get emotional when communicating, they have to be empathetic appealing to the hearts and minds of the audience,\u201d said Mr Voedisch. \n However, he was uncertain if an address by Mr Lee to the public at an earlier juncture would have helped.\u00a0 \n Instead, he said that the authorities should have foreseen the responses from the public as part of proper scenario planning with \u201cready-to-go action plans\u201d. \n Also, they should have anticipated and addressed the public\u2019s concerns and fears across the different platforms, he added.\u00a0 \n THE RAMIFICATIONS\u00a0 \n Mr Chan, the Trade and Industry Minister, had spoken out against panic buying and hoarding behaviour by a \u201csmall segment of Singaporeans\u201d, even though he noted that this was to be expected.\u00a0 \n In a Facebook post on Feb 8, he noted that it was \u201cnatural\u201d in times of uncertainty that people want to protect themselves and the ones that they love.\u00a0 \n \u201cHowever I urge all of us to think of the larger communities we belong to. Hoarding means that we deprive others of things that they really need,\u201d he said. \u201cThat could be your neighbour who needs to buy rice for her children\u2019s meals or even organisations looking after the vulnerable who require cleaning supplies.\u201d \n Speaking to the media the next day, Mr Chan also said that the panic buying at supermarkets will signal to other countries that Singaporeans cannot react well in times of crisis and could be taken advantage of in the future. \n One potential consequence, he warned, is that suppliers and retailers who observe the panic buying might take advantage of the situation and jack up prices of goods. \n Ultimately, the hoarding behaviour was \u201ca fight-or-flight response that has arisen primarily from fear and a need for self-preservation\u201d, said the SPS council spokesperson. \n And this fear can breed distrust and hostility towards others. \u201cWith a constant overemphasis on fear, people may start to behave in less caring or more complacent ways in order to maintain self-preservation,\u201d the spokesperson added.\u00a0\u00a0 \n HERE COMES THE GOOD \n Still, despite the panic buying grabbing the headlines, Mr Chan and other government leaders took pains to point out that a large majority of Singaporeans had been \u201ccalm and rational\u201d.\u00a0 \n Many Singaporeans had come forward to thank the cashiers and supermarket staff constantly working behind the scenes to restock the empty shelves, Mr Chan noted.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Countless others have also stepped in to do their part for their fellow citizens, with numerous ground-up initiatives started in the community. \n For example, TODAY had reported about two primary school girls who used their pocket money to buy and deliver breakfast to doctors and nurses. On Valentine\u2019s Day which fell on Friday, community group StandUpForSG also gave out \u201clove letters\u201d to frontline healthcare workers. \n  \n (From left) Sisters Ruirui and Rui'en delivering breakfast to a healthcare worker on Feb 8, 2020. Photo: Tong Yee/ Facebook \n QUIET RESILIENCE\u00a0 \n Away from the public spotlight and media glare, ordinary Singaporeans have got on with their lives, despite the disruptions and worries brought on by the Covid-19 outbreak.\u00a0 \n Scores of Singaporeans \u2014 such as taxi and private-hire drivers, as well as those in the retail and tourism industries \u2014 have seen their livelihoods take\u00a0a hit. Others have had to adjust to working from home as business continuity plans swung into place. \n Cleaners, for example, are putting in longer hours while healthcare workers not only have to work longer each day but are also putting themselves at risk on the frontlines.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \n A 23-year-old outbreak nurse who works with Covid-19 patients said that while her family understands the risks of her occupation, it does not stop them from worrying.\u00a0 \n \u201cMost nurses are worried too, but it\u2019s our job and this is what we do for a living,\u201d said the nurse, who wanted to be known only as Sharmaine due to the sensitivity of her role. \n When she was first assigned to handle suspected Covid-19 cases, Sharmaine said she was scared as no one knew what exactly they were dealing with.\u00a0 \n \u201cBut over time, I grew immune to it, even if a patient were to test positive for the virus. Now I don't feel so scared anymore.\u201d \n However, she feels disappointed at the discrimination against healthcare workers shown by some Singaporeans, even as many others expressed gratitude for their work.\u00a0 \u201cIt truly is demoralising when you hear of such incidents. We feel ostracised at times because all we want to do is perform our job and go home,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we continue to keep an open mind because we are the first line of defence.\u201d \n  \n Messages from the public thanking healthcare workers for their hard work. These messages were put up on Facebook with the hashtag #braveheartsg, in response to the initiative by community group StandUpForSG.

This is an opportunity to bond with the kids, work on some home improvement tasks and plan for the year ahead,\u201d Mr Chiam said.\u00a0 \n \u201cMaybe through these tough times, we can develop some new good habits for the family that will stay with us even after the threat is over.\u201d \n Some businesses have had to adjust their operating models due to the outbreak. \n Ms Jazz Chong, the owner and director of contemporary gallery Ode To Art, has noticed fewer people visiting the gallery as well as the Raffles City Shopping Centre, where the gallery is located.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \u201cWith the virus outbreak becoming more severe, we have now decided to take the extra measure of bringing the art to our clients directly,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they like the work then it can remain in their home, making it extra convenient for them as they do not even have to leave their house.\u201d \n Meanwhile, curtain maker and supplier MC2 held its first Facebook Live event on Feb 11. \n Mr Wilson Chew, the founder and managing director of the company, said: \u201cDuring this time of crisis when people may be worried about attending events with crowds, we thought of using Facebook Live.\u201d \n By broadcasting live on the social media platform, customers were given the chance to ask questions and interact with the company\u2019s salesperson in real time as he gave demonstrations of the company\u2019s various zip-blind products.\u00a0 \n Business owners like Ms Chong and Mr Chew are hoping that people would continue life as normal, albeit taking the necessary precautions.\u00a0 \n Or as NTU\u2019s Asst Prof Liew put it: \u201cWe must have a courageous sense of normality and go on living life normally.\u201d\u00a0 \n Indeed, Prime Minister Lee noted on Friday that the Covid-19 outbreak is expected to last longer than Sars, with a greater impact already hitting the economy. \u00a0 But he stressed: \u201cWe have to keep Singapore going and we have to keep making a living.

Scientists believe that poisonous snakes consumed by the Chinese population may be the source of the coronavirus that has already killed more than twenty people and has already reached Europe. These animals are sold at the seafood market in Wuhan, China, the city where the virus has spread. According to The Conversation, numerous scientists have been analyzing the genetic code of the coronavirus and recently discovered that the code present in the samples is identical to that of other viruses present in snakes, bats and birds. This epidemic originated in the Chinese city where the market that sells the reptiles consumed by the population is located. Chinese snakes or Taiwan snakes are a highly venomous reptile species residing in central and southern China. The animals are not only sold in the city of origin of the virus, but they also hunt bats, another possible animal species that can be infected with the corona-like virus. This epidemic has killed more than twenty people and infected several dozen, leading to the isolation of the city as well as the suspension of some public transport. Recent reports confirm that there are already people of Chinese origin infected in the United States. Professor J\u00fcrgen Haas recently told The Guardian that four tourists from Wuhan are being examined in Edinburgh and Glasgow, UK, for suspected carriers of the disease. So far, none of the tests carried out confirm the suspicions raised by the doctors. The first report of this epidemic took place in December 2019 and showed rapid spread.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Yang Zhongyi was still waiting on Monday for a coronavirus test in the Chinese city of Wuhan two weeks after she started to show signs of a fever, even though doctors privately told her family that she almost certainly has been infected, her son Zhang Changchun told Reuters.\nYang, 53, is just one of many Wuhan inhabitants finding it difficult to get tested or receive treatment for the new form of coronavirus, which authorities say has infected 2,800 people and killed at least 80 in China, a situation that may be contributing to the spread of the disease.\nYang has been unable to gain full-time admission to a hospital, her son said. She has been put on drips in unquarantined areas at four separate hospitals in the city to treat her deteriorating lungs, he said, while he is doing what he can to get her tested or admitted full-time.\n\u201cMy brother and I have been queuing at the hospital every day. We go at 6 and 7 in the morning, and queue for the whole day, but we don\u2019t get any new answers,\u201d Zhang told Reuters. \u201cEvery time the responses are the same: \u2018There\u2019s no bed, wait for the government to give a notice, and follow the news to see what\u2019s going on.\u2019 The doctors are all very frustrated too.\u201d\nOfficially known as 2019-nCoV, the new form of coronavirus was first identified as the cause of death of a 61-year-old man in Wuhan on Jan. 10, when China shared gene information on the virus with other countries. Some, such as Japan and Thailand, started testing travelers from China for the virus within three days.\nHowever, testing kits for the disease were not distributed to some of Wuhan\u2019s hospitals until about Jan. 20, an official at the Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Hubei CDC) told Reuters. Before then, samples had to be sent to a laboratory in Beijing for testing, a process that took three to five days to get results, according to Wuhan health authorities.\nDuring that gap, hospitals in the city reduced the number of people under medical observation from 739 to just 82, according to data compiled by Reuters from Wuhan health authorities, and no new cases were reported inside China.\nDespite the lack of reliable data and testing capacity in Wuhan, Chinese authorities assured citizens in the days after the virus had been identified that it was not widely transmissible. In previous weeks, it had censored negative online commentary about the situation, and arrested eight people it accused of being \u201crumor spreaders.\u201d\n\u201cThe doctor didn\u2019t wear a mask, we didn\u2019t know how to protect ourselves... no one told us anything,\u201d a 45-year-old woman surnamed Chen told Reuters. Her aunt was confirmed to have the virus on Jan. 20, five days after she was hospitalized. \u201cI posted my aunt\u2019s photos on (Chinese social media site) Weibo and the police called the hospital authorities. They told me to take it down.\u201d\nNational, regional and city health officials did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters on how the virus outbreak has been handled. National officials did say at a media briefing last week that there were some \u201cloopholes\u201d in initial treatment methods.\nWuhan\u2019s mayor, Zhou Xianwang, told Chinese state television on Monday he recognized that \u201call parties were not satisfied with the disclosure of our information.\u201d But he pointed to strictures placed upon him by provincial and national leaders.\n\u201cIn local governance, after I receive information, I can only release it when I\u2019m authorized,\u201d he said. Zhou told a media briefing on Sunday that a further 1,000 people could be diagnosed with the virus in Wuhan, based on the number of patients yet to be tested.\nChina last week locked down the affected region in Hubei province in the biggest quarantine operation on record and is building two new hospitals to treat virus patients. President Xi Jinping has created a special committee to tackle the outbreak.\nThe country has been praised internationally for quickly sequencing the virus gene. However, its slow scale-up of testing has been questioned.\nOnce a virus has been identified, \u201cYou need to make sure you have all the reagent (a substance used in chemical analysis) samples and you\u2019ve got it all pushed out to where you want to do testing,\u201d said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, who focuses on emerging infectious disease and pandemic preparedness.\nAlthough information from the region is scarce, Adalja suggested China has had problems with this stage of tackling the outbreak. \u201cWe\u2019re already hearing that there are shortages of medical professionals there, that there are shortages of test kits and medicines,\u201d he said.\nJohn Edmunds, a professor at the center for mathematical modeling of infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said China has not communicated enough detailed data after the initial outbreak.\n\u201cWe have a very incomplete picture of what\u2019s going on,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cWhether it\u2019s incompetence, secrecy, or deliberate, I don\u2019t know, but it would be very useful if we could have some basic epidemiological data.\u201d\nThe shortage of testing supplies and China\u2019s initial reticence have drawn criticism that the country is still learning lessons from the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002 that killed almost 800 people.\n\u201cThe improvements have been on the hard science side - figuring out the virus\u2019s genome, building new hospitals at a moment\u2019s notice - more than on the soft science side of managing information and dealing with people,\u201d said Mary Gallagher, a political science professor who leads the University of Michigan\u2019s Center for Chinese Studies.\nCity managers had little incentive to escalate problems to political superiors. The week in which no new virus cases were reported in Hubei coincided with preparations for the Lunar New Year and sessions of the province\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress and the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference.\nSeven of the largest hospitals in Wuhan are now equipped with testing kits for the virus, which in theory deliver results within a day, the Hubei CDC official said.\nBut four people told Reuters they were refused tests because the process involved a complex reporting system including hospital, district and city health authorities and disease control officials.\nTo qualify for the test, patients need to meet certain criteria, such as having symptoms of fever and pneumonia, and a surge in patients means it is \u201cimpossible to conduct the test right away,\u201d an official at the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention told Reuters.\nThree hospital and local government workers, who have been briefed on how doctors are handling tests and confirming cases, told Reuters that official numbers of infections and deaths do not reflect the actual toll.\nWuhan health authorities have a limit on tests, chiefly because of the shortage of testing kits, and are screening lists of patients before deciding who gets a test, which takes several hours, one hospital worker told Reuters.\n\u201cSome severely ill patients were left out from the final list for testing because they know they wouldn\u2019t be able to be treated,\u201d the worker told Reuters. \u201cThe actual deaths were higher.\u201d\nReuters could not independently confirm the hospital worker\u2019s account. Hubei and Wuhan health authorities did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.\nZhang, whose mother is still waiting for a test, said doctors at three Wuhan hospitals told her family privately that they are almost certain she has contracted the coronavirus.\nHowever, he said two of those hospitals told him they are not equipped with testing kits, and the other told him it has no available bed to accommodate his mother for the test.\nNone of those hospitals replied to Reuters requests for comment.\nSixty-nine year-old Xu Enen, who has had fever and a lung infection since Jan. 8, was rejected by six hospitals in Wuhan for testing as they said they had ran out of beds, his daughter told Reuters. Xu\u2019s symptoms have worsened lately, and he is starting to have breathing difficulties.\nHe was finally admitted on Jan. 22 to queue for the test at Hankou hospital in Wuhan after his daughter publicized his case on Weibo.\nResearchers at Lancaster University estimate that only 5.1% of infections in Wuhan have been identified. By Jan. 21, they estimated a total of 11,341 people had been infected in Wuhan since the start of the year. More than 30,000 people in Wuhan are under observation, according to the city\u2019s health authorities.\n\u201cAll we want is to confirm the case is the virus or not,\u201d said a 33-year-old Wuhan woman surnamed Liu, whose father has been on a respirator in hospital since Jan. 14 and was still untested on Monday. \u201cAt least if it\u2019s confirmed we have a direction.

The repatriation process of 18 Portuguese and two Brazilian citizens who were held for several days in the city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak of the new strain of coronavirus, was an authentic odyssey. There are, after all, 20, including two diplomats from the Portuguese embassy in Beijing, and all agreed to be in \u201cprophylactic isolation\u201d and with no chance of visits, even controlled ones, for two weeks at the Pulido Valente Hospital and at the Parque da Sa\u00fade facilities , in Lisbon, explained the Health minister at a press conference on Sunday night. All will have agreed, assured Marta Temido, since Portuguese law does not provide for the mandatory quarantine of non-sick people, contrary to what happens in other countries. In addition to 16 Portuguese (and not 17, as initially announced), two Brazilian citizens &quot;who were also in China and accompanied our compatriots&quot; were transferred from Wuhan, in addition to the two Portuguese diplomats, specified the governor, flanked by four secretaries of State (Health, Foreign Affairs, Defense and Civil Protection) and the Director-General of Health. In the 14-hour flight that took them from Wuhan to France, 250 citizens from three dozen European countries traveled and 20 were held up in a military base France near Marseilles for showing symptoms of possible contagion. The Portuguese were not in contact with these passengers on the huge plane that transported them, an Airbus A-380, but even so, and as a precautionary principle, they will remain in this voluntary isolation in the facilities prepared to receive them (13 individual rooms in Pulido Valente and ten others at Parque da Sa\u00fade). In Porto, the Military Hospital is also ready to receive those from the North, but this does not seem necessary for the time being. \u201cThis was the last leg of a very long trip\u201d, emphasized the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Teresa Ribeiro. Ensuring that there was &quot;tranquility in the approach of the preventive measure&quot; that puts the returnees of Wuhan in isolation, Marta Temido stressed that this is a measure &quot;that is in line with what is being carried out by other countries&quot; and is based on the &quot;phase epidemic&quot; and of &quot;containment&quot; decreed at international level. In fact, he recalled, the Portuguese were already &quot;accustomed [to isolation] in Chinese territory&quot;, where they spent several days confined at home. In this way, he added, they may also have better monitoring by health services.\u201d Isolation should last 14 days (the incubation period of the disease until the onset of symptoms) and \u201cactive surveillance\u201d will be carried out by health professionals twice a day.

New tests After being subjected to tests on their way out of China, which proved negative, the 20 are being tested again here. At Pulido Valente, biological material will be collected to be analyzed in the early morning hours of Monday at the National Institute of Health Doctor Ricardo Jorge (Insa). In a few hours it will be possible to see if any of them are infected. During isolation, if one suspects that any of them are infected due to the revelation of various symptoms, they will be immediately transported to Curry Cabral, a referral hospital for confirmed cases in a possible outbreak of the new coronavirus in Portugal (the others are the S .

China reported 46 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, while the city of Wuhan, the pandemic's ground zero, announced it would be loosening a two-month lockdown by gradually resuming public transportation and allowing healthy people to resume work.\nIt was the fourth day in a row with an increase in Chinese cases, all but one of which was imported from overseas.\nBut in a sign of easing lockdown measures, residents living in and outside Wuhan will be allowed to travel into the city to resume work if they have a green health code issued by the government and normal body temperature, state-media CCTV News reported on Sunday. It cited the city's epidemic prevention and control command center.\nNon-local people stranded in Wuhan can also apply to leave the city after taking an RNA test and receiving a health certificate from the government, the channel said.\nDespite the relaxed measures for Wuhan and a reduced number of domestically transmitted cases - the one reported on Sunday was the first in four days - China is seeing a steady rise in imported cases, mostly Chinese people returning from overseas. That has led Beijing to further step up measures to intercept cases from abroad as the outbreak worsens globally.\nIn a sign of how seriously China is taking the threat of imported cases, all international flights due to arrive in Beijing starting Monday will first land at another airport, where passengers will undergo virus screening, government agencies said on Sunday, in an expansion of existing measures.\nInternational flights that were scheduled to arrive in the capital will land instead at one of 12 airports. Passengers who clear screening will then be permitted to reboard the plane, which will then fly to Beijing, the regulator said.\nSeparately, Shanghai and Guangzhou both announced that all arriving international passengers will undergo an RNA test to screen for coronavirus, expanding a program that previously only applied to those coming from heavily-hit countries.\nAmong the new cases from abroad reported on Sunday, a record 14 were in the financial hub of Shanghai and 13 were in Beijing, a decline from 21 the previous day.\nThe new locally transmitted case was in the southern metropolis of Guangzhou and was also the first known case where the infection of a local person was linked to the arrival of someone from overseas, according to Guangdong province.\nHu Xijin, the editor-in-chief of the Global Times newspaper, called for all cities in China to implement 14-day quarantines for people arriving from abroad.\nHe also called for quarantine policies to apply to people from Hong Kong and Macau as well, he said on his Weibo account on Sunday.\n\"I am worried that there are similar cases to the Guangzhou one existing in other parts of the country.

He said China's recent policy measures were gaining traction, and it has capacity for further action.\nChen Yulu, a deputy governor at the People's Bank of China (PBOC), also said he expects significant improvement in the Chinese economy in the second quarter.\nAnd while the virus will continue putting upward pressure on near-term consumer prices, there is no basis for long-term inflation or deflation, he told a news briefing.\nGlobally, roughly 275,000 people have been infected with the virus, and more than 11,000 have died, according to a Reuters tally, with the number of deaths in Italy recently surpassing those in China.\n\"Now I think the epidemic has been controlled.

A few days later, a group led by virologist Christian Drosten from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers are provisionally calling 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. The Chinese authorities suspect the source of the pathogen to be a food market in Wuhan, where not only fish and seafood but also exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected. Both Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic in 2002 and 2003, around 8,000 people were infected and more than 750 died. Between its discovery in 2012 and the end of 2019, around 2,500 people were infected with the Mers virus, and every third person died from it. In total, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example. Several thousand people have now become ill in China, some of them - most of them probably with previous illnesses - died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first cases of infection outside of China became known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been to Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who was returning from Wuhan, and on January 24, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia, which can be fatal. Since it is a viral disease, antibiotics won&#39;t help. It is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after a dozen or so cases among medical personnel became known. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. As it announced on January 24, the World Health Organization currently expects that an infected person will infect an average of 1.4 to 2.5 other people. If these numbers prove to be true, the virus is less contagious than Sars and so is the flu. The WHO recommends following general hygiene rules: You should wash your hands often and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals. It is not yet possible to say with certainty. The World Health Organization announced on January 28th that around a fifth of the reported cases would become seriously ill from the virus, so if in doubt they would have to be treated in intensive care. According to reports, the first fatalities were patients, some of whom had serious previous illnesses. People with previous illnesses are also particularly at risk from other infectious diseases - such as the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, i.e. change their genetic makeup. That can make them more dangerous to people in the course of an outbreak - but also the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate that is as high as that of the Sars outbreak. Federal Minister of Health Jens Spahn (CDU) emphasized that Germany was well prepared for the virus. In an interview with Focus magazine, he said that the federal government had taken measures to identify suspected cases early and thus minimize the risk of infection. Spahn said that he did not consider the new type of respiratory disease to be an emergency in Germany: &quot;We are very vigilant. But calm.&quot; In China, infections and deaths from the coronavirus continued to rise. The number of patients grew by 1,981 to 9,692, as reported by the Beijing Health Commission. The number of deaths rose by 42 to 213. The World Health Organization (WHO) had previously declared the spread of the virus to be a &quot;health emergency of international concern&quot;. The 190 member countries will thus coordinate the crisis measures recommended by the WHO. Because of the virus, the US State Department issued a travel warning for all of China. The Foreign Office in Berlin initially warned against traveling to the hardest-hit province of Hubei, but recommended in a partial travel warning that unnecessary trips to China be postponed &quot;if possible&quot;."}, {"content": "Second plane of evacuees from China lands in France. \u201cThere are many Europeans, 29 different nationalities, 30 with French nationality,\u201d said Jean-Yves le Drian, France's minister of foreign affairs.\n\u201cWe have assumed our responsibility in the sharing and solidarity with Europeans.

BEIJING, Jan\u00a030 -- The seafood market in Wuhan, central China's Hubei Province, may not be the only source of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, Xinhua news agency reported a Chinese pulmonary disease specialist as saying.Huang Chaolin, vice director of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, revealed in a recent interview with business magazine Caixin that there might be multiple places where the virus was first transmitted to humans.Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital is one of the city's designated hospitals to admit patients infected with the new virus. Huang and his team have recently published a paper in the Lancet, the world's leading general medical journal, about some early findings on the clinical data of the first 41 novel coronavirus cases.The first patient, who was admitted to Huang's hospital on Dec\u00a01, 2019, had no direct exposure to Wuhan's Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which was previously considered as the source of the epidemic, and his family had no fever or respiratory symptoms, according to the paper.Among the following three patients who were admitted on Dec. 10, two had no exposure to the seafood market. In total, only 27 of the 41 cases had exposure to the marketplace, said the paper.\"Judging from the whole situation, the seafood market may not be the only source. (The origin of the novel coronavirus) might be multi-source,\" Huang said.But no clues about other sources have been discovered.The Huanan seafood market is located in the downtown area of the city's Jianghan District, less than one kilometre away from Hankou railway station. Besides seafood, poultry and game meat were also sold in the market before it was shut down on Jan\u00a01.Experts of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention have previously isolated the novel coronavirus successfully in the environmental samples collected from the market. Thirty-three of 585 samples from the market were found to contain the nucleic acid of the virus.As of the end of Tuesday, the novel coronavirus had claimed 132 lives and infected 5,974 people nationwide in China.--BERNAMA\u00a0"}, {"content": "COLUMN-Asia's coal markets diverge on quality lines as coronavirus hits India: Russell. (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)\n* GRAPHIC: ICE Newcastle coal vs. SGX Indonesia coal: reut.rs/3bmYOzG\nBy Clyde Russell\nLAUNCESTON, Australia, March 26 (Reuters) - Asia\u2019s seaborne coal market is increasingly diverging between higher-quality Australian coal, where prices are holding up despite the economic shock being caused by the coronavirus, and lower-quality Indonesian fuel, which is losing ground.\nThe price of Australian benchmark Newcastle thermal coal futures traded on the Intercontinental Exchange ended at $66.35 a tonne on Wednesday, down slightly from the prior day but up from the low so far this year of $65.15 on March 9.\nThe contract, which covers coal with an energy value of 6,000 kilocalories per kilogram (kcal/kg), has traded in a fairly narrow band so far this year, and at the close on Wednesday was only 2% weaker than at the end of last year.\nThis is despite the massive disruption caused to the economy of China, the world\u2019s biggest coal importer, in the wake of the spread of the coronavirus from its origin in the city of Wuhan.\nWhile China has largely contained the virus, it has now spread across the globe, leading to increasingly strong isolation measures in many countries, with the concomitant economic fallout.\nHowever, futures for Indonesian coal with an energy rating of 4,200 kcal/kg traded in Singapore ended at $32.61 a tonne on Wednesday, the lowest price this year.\nThe contract is down 10.7% from its peak so far in 2020 of $36.51 a tonne on Feb. 10, and is also 4% softer than its close at the end of last year.\nWhat lies behind the divergence of the two main types of seaborne coal in Asia?\nThe most likely explanation is the current coronavirus crisis is changing market dynamics, rather than any structural change in supply or demand.\nIndonesia\u2019s coal exports have been in a range around 30 million tonnes in recent months, with China and India accounting for about 60% of the total.\nAt the start of the year, both markets were performing well, with China actually importing more coal during its coronavirus lockdown, due to the impact on domestic mines and transport infrastructure.\nIndia\u2019s imports from Indonesia were also resilient in the first two months of the year as coastal power plants increased generation, but they appear to be tapering off this month.\nIn the first 25 days of March just 4.04 million tonnes of Indonesian coal was discharged at Indian ports, according to vessel-tracking data compiled by Refinitiv.\nWhile that figure will rise by the end of month as more cargoes are unloaded, it looks certain that March\u2019s total will be below February\u2019s 7.96 million tonnes and January\u2019s 7.42 million.\nIndia has lagged the rest of Asia in being hit by the coronavirus, but the country is now taking strong lockdown measures to prevent its spread, which will curb demand for electricity to power industry.\nCoal stocks at power plants and mines have also been rising, with the Business Standard newspaper reporting on March 24 that inventories were above 100 million tonnes, with stocks at plants reaching a record 41.4 million tonnes.\nPlentiful stocks combined with a sharp slowdown in economic activity mean India\u2019s coal imports are likely to slip in coming months, especially from Indonesia.\nAustralia supplies virtually no thermal coal to India, which generally takes Indonesian coal because of its lower cost and cheaper freight rates. Australia\u2019s trade with India is largely in coking coal used in steel-making.\nThe main markets for Australian thermal coal are China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, and Refinitiv data shows these markets have been resilient so far this year.\nTogether these four markets imported 26.8 million tonnes of both thermal and coking coal from Australia in January, the most since July last year, while February\u2019s total was 21.22 million, up from 20.1 million in the same month last year.\nWith the coronavirus outbreak seemingly contained in China and Taiwan, and progress being made in Japan and South Korea, it\u2019s possible that their imports of coal will hold up in coming months, with the main risk being the economic downturn in the rest of the world.\nAssuming no shock to supply should mines be forced to close in Australia to combat the coronavirus, there is a case that prices shouldn\u2019t decline too much, but it would be difficult to make a bullish case until the world economy is showing signs of recovery.\nWith far greater exposure to India, Indonesian coal prices are more under threat, and will remain so until it\u2019s clear that the world\u2019s second-biggest importer of coal has beaten the coronavirus.

BEIJING:\u00a0A new virus that has killed nine people, infected hundreds and reached the United States could mutate and spread, China warned on Wednesday (Jan 22), as authorities urged people to steer clear of the city at the heart of the outbreak. \n The coronavirus has caused alarm due to its similarity to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. \n With hundreds of millions of people travelling across China this week for the Chinese New Year holiday, the National Health Commission announced measures to contain the disease -\u00a0including sterilisation and ventilation at airports and bus stations, as well as inside planes and trains. \n  \n In Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, authorities cancelled large public events, called on visitors to stay away and urged residents not to leave the central Chinese city of 11 million people. \n The illness is mainly transmitted via the respiratory tract and there \"is the possibility of viral mutation and further spread of the disease\", health commission vice minister Li Bin told a news conference in Beijing. \n The virus has now infected at least 440 people across the country, with most cases in Wuhan. Li added that 1,394 people are still under medical observation. \n The World Health Organization (WHO) will hold an emergency meeting Wednesday to determine whether to declare a rare global public health emergency over the disease, which has now been detected in the United States, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, South Korea and Macau. \n The first case in the United States - a Seattle resident in his 30s - is in good condition, American officials said. \n The Chinese government has classified the outbreak in the same category as the SARS epidemic, meaning compulsory isolation for those diagnosed with the illness and the potential to implement quarantine measures. \n  \n But they still have not been able to confirm the exact source of the virus, which has infected at least 440 people across the country. \n \"We will step up research efforts to identify the source and transmission of the disease,\" Li said, although he said experts believe \"the cases are mostly linked to Wuhan\". \n  \n Countries have been intensifying efforts to stop the spread of the pathogen - known by its technical name 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) -\u00a0as the number of cases jumped. \n Plane passengers are facing screening measures at five US airports and a host of transport hubs across Asia. \n North Korea will ban foreign tourists entirely to protect itself against the virus, according to a major tour operator. \n VIRUS SOURCE \n A prominent expert from China's National Health Commission confirmed this week that the virus can be passed between people. \n  \n However, animals are suspected to be the primary source of the outbreak. \n A price list circulating online in China for a business at the Wuhan market lists a menagerie of animals or animal-based products including live foxes, crocodiles, wolf puppies and rats. It also offered civets, the animal linked to SARS. \n \"We already know that the disease originated from a market which conducted illegal transaction of wild animals,\" said Gao Fu, director of the Chinese centre for disease control and prevention. \n He said it was clear \"this virus is adapting and mutating\". \n Hong Kong and British scientists have estimated that between 1,300 and 1,700 people in Wuhan may have been infected. \n CONTAINMENT \n Health authorities are urging people to wash their hands regularly, avoid crowded places, get plenty of fresh air, and wear a mask if they have a cough. \n Anyone with a cough or fever was urged to go to hospital. \n Surgical masks and antibacterial products were starting to sell out on some popular online sites and pharmacies. \n  \n \"These days, I wear masks even in places that are not too crowded, although I wouldn't have done so in the past,\" said Wang Suping, 50, who works at a Beijing arts school. \n At the capital's main international airport, the majority of people were wearing masks. \n Hong Kong flag carrier Cathay Airlines said they agreed to allow staff to wear surgical masks on mainland China flights, adding they would offer masks and antiseptic wipes to passengers travelling from Wuhan to the city. \n In Wuhan, police were conducting vehicle spot checks for live poultry or wild animals leaving and entering the city, state media said. Officials also screened people on roads, the airport and the train station for fevers. \n \"If it's not necessary we suggest that people don't come to Wuhan,\" Mayor Zhou Xianwang told state broadcaster CCTV. \n The local government has cancelled major public activities and banned tour groups from heading out of the city. \n Women's football qualifiers for the Tokyo Olympic Games that were supposed to be held in Wuhan between Feb\u00a03-9 were moved to the eastern city of Nanjing. \n Follow us on Telegram for the latest updates: https://cna.asia/telegram"}, {"content": "There are fears - and there is racism. Franka Lu is a Chinese journalist and entrepreneur. She works in China and Germany. In this ZEIT-ONLINE series, she reports critically about life, culture and everyday life in China. In order to protect her professional and private environment, she writes under a pseudonym. The coronavirus epidemic is a test of human sanity. At the Berlin S-Bahn station Beusselstrasse, a Chinese student was insulted and kicked by two women. In Toronto, an old lady from Hong Kong was insulted in a supermarket. In France, the Courrier Picard newspaper headlined &quot;Alerte jaune&quot; (&quot;Yellow Alert&quot;) and &quot;Le p\u00e9ril jaune?&quot; (&quot;Yellow Danger?&quot;), A picture of a Chinese woman with a protective mask was shown (the newspaper has meanwhile apologized to its readers for the choice of words). The cover design of the latest issue of Spiegel about the virus - &quot;Made in China&quot; - caused outrage, even if the content of the cover story goes in a different direction. People with Chinese roots also experience direct hostility in Germany. All over the world, incidents directed against Asian-looking people remind us of an old lesson: fear and ignorance can make people hostile to others who consider them to belong to a certain group, ethnicity, nation overnight. Plagues divide us humans. Albert Camus tells about it in The Plague, Jos\u00e9 Saramago in The City of the Blind. This is nothing new, it will certainly happen again in the future, wherever people live. The more one feels threatened by a catastrophe, the more fear and stupidity will determine human behavior and lead to violence and cruelty. The resurgence of hostility towards the Chinese can be called racism, but the phenomenon is not limited to the West. In China, people from the Wuhan disease outbreak area are suffering from hostilities in other parts of the country. You are insulted or even physically attacked. As a Chinese living in Germany, I am angered less by the expected human inhumanities on a small scale; I am angered by the profiteers on a large scale. Like many other Chinese in Germany, I have experienced a lot of respect and hospitality here. Laws, statutes and social norms in Germany are so finely geared towards avoiding racism that as soon as I got used to it, I was shocked at how much tolerance people in the USA, for example, have for the statements of neo-Nazis. I have also experienced racist attacks, but never considered them symptomatic. But for the behavior of people who believe they are in need (or even are) and are looking for an outlet. Are we now, in times of epidemic, facing the threat of a global resurgence of anti-Chinese racism that many vigilant observers are warning of? I am not sure yet. It is true that it can never be wrong to slow down a dangerous social development before it is too late. But on how to do it most effectively, especially at a time when many societies already seem deeply divided, I may disagree. On the individual level, I find anti-racist slogans like &quot;Chinese are not a virus!&quot; or &quot;Don&#39;t be a racist!&quot; unhelpful. There are people who are racists to the core. Racists will always find an excuse to attack others. You have to fight racists. But to scold a Parisian saleswoman for getting nervous in the face of Chinese tourists, or to scold a German employee who suddenly no longer likes to sit in the conference room with his Chinese colleague, seems exaggerated to me. The better way to relieve people of their fears and avoid such clashes is to have solid information about potential routes of infection, risks, and measures you can take to protect yourself. It is much better to show people that there is something they can do about the risk of contagion rather than shaming them for their fears. Things are different on a political and social level. If the spread of the coronavirus turned into a truly global pandemic, it could lead to tribalism in the worst form, especially at a time when right-wing populists - such as Donald Trump, the Brexit camp, European right-wing extremists - exploit it politically. Racism is nothing more than one of the many forms of tribalism. You can heat it up with sensational headlines, even if the editors of the Courrier Picard or the Spiegel presumably do not want to be on the wrong side. The appeal of nationalism is still strong. Compared to other countries, in Germany I experience great vigilance in domestic politics towards nationalist narratives. But that they also exist elsewhere, but are used even more successfully politically, one has to be more aware of this in Germany as well. In China, the government has long taught people to see the Communist Party, the country and the people as a unit. This is an effective way to ensure the loyalty of all citizens and to give them a false sense of belonging and home. That is why many Chinese overseas feel personally attacked when they hear non-Chinese people criticize the Chinese Communist Party or the government there. You have learned to fully identify with the party and the state. Unfortunately, many Germans, German media and even German politics occasionally make the same mistake and confuse the people of China with their government. There are facts that are still underreported in the European media. The new coronavirus is not &quot;Made in China&quot; any more than Ebola is &quot;Made in Africa&quot;. These viruses were not made on purpose, the way one makes products that have the &quot;Made in&quot; designation printed on them. But the arrogant and authoritarian system in China initially allowed the disease to spread through inaction. Many Chinese people, especially in the region around Wuhan, are slowly realizing that they have been allowed to run into a crisis situation with their eyesight: the seriousness of the situation and the dangers have been hushed up. Other Chinese people still hold on to their belief in the supposedly omnipotent government because it is the only support they know. The crisis in China has many facets. There is a lack of transparency; the government and the authorities do not in fact allow themselves to be held responsible for their actions or inaction; the state health system is weak; there is no freedom of expression in the country. Many Chinese people risk their lives (and their freedom) to defeat the virus and bypass the obstacles that the authoritarian system puts in their way. If the world knew of their achievements and could recognize them, there should be no anti-Chinese tendencies elsewhere. As long as people outside of China do not have a clear picture of it, they will only see the coronavirus outbreak as a threatening state of emergency that has its origins in &quot;China&quot;, a country of which they only have a vague idea. &quot;China&quot; is to blame! This vague idea of \u200b\u200b&quot;China&quot; is in itself a form of tribalism, because it is fed by stereotypes and not from the perception of a country and its inhabitants, the livelihoods and achievements of individuals. Of people who fight against the arrogance of power that rules over them; seek and want to spread the truth; who face a crisis with great bravery and intellectual discernment; but who also have to struggle with their own human weaknesses - idiocy has no homeland or country of origin. But the stories of the brave Chinese must be heard. Camus taught us about the plague: &quot;Evil in the world almost always comes from ignorance, and goodwill without understanding can do as much harm as malice.&quot; Camus meant deep understanding, no vague half-knowledge. It takes courage to look at the whole truth because it might be found offensive; because one could offend others with it; because you may feel uncomfortable with her or with others. One of the first lessons to be learned from this coronavirus crisis is that one has to distinguish between the Chinese government and the people of China. If this succeeds, it would be progress."}, {"content": "Pompeo conveyed 'strong U.S. objections' to Beijing over COVID-19 accusations.

HONG KONG \u2014 When a virus enters the human body, it's in a race against time to hijack cells, reproduce and spread. Its survival depends on it, because once the body's immune system detects the intruder an all-out microscopic war follows. \n While the Sars-CoV-2 virus behind the present pandemic has killed thousands and spread fear around the world, the immune system \u2014 which has evolved over millions of years of fighting pathogens\u00a0\u2014 shows no such trepidation. It responds with ferocity to obliterate the invader, led by armies of killer T-cells. \n That immune system is one reason the human species still exists, but in some cases its fight against viruses can resemble the scorched-earth policy of warfare, where everything in the area of the conflict takes damage, meaning body tissue itself. The immune system takes no prisoners. \n But before the war at the cellular level, the virus slips into the body, navigating past defences in the mucus that gathers in noses and throats, on the hunt for cells it can commandeer. At the same time, it's trying to disguise its presence to avoid tripping the chemical alarm system of the immune system\u00a0\u2014 a deadly game of hide-and-seek. \n In the first few hours after the pathogen's entry, it was \"almost like a dance between the innate immune response and the virus\", said Mr Gene Olinger, an immunologist with the US-based scientific institute MRIGlobal. The virus tries different tricks to dodge the immune system's many detection devices. \n This was the start of what become an \"arms race\" between the virus and immune system, said Ms Marjolein Kikkert, an associate professor who researches this type of biochemical conflict at Leiden University Medical Centre in the Netherlands. \n \"All viruses, including this one, will have multiple ways that they look to circumvent or suppress immune response ... there's an arms race, especially in the beginning, when the virus is trying to prevent these first responses,\" Ms Kikkert said. \n Once the immune system is triggered and a T-cell finds a body cell that has become a virus factory, it typically latches on and fires molecules that punch through the cell's membrane, killing it and everything inside. \n But as Sars-CoV-2 is a newly discovered virus, researchers have not had enough laboratory time to determine the specifics of how the battle plays out. That leaves questions like why some healthy people infected with Sars-CoV-2 become severely ill and others do not, researchers have said. \n Much of what is suspected about how the body fights back is based on research on the body's immune response to closely related coronavirus infections, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars). There are also the clinical records of patients with Covid-19, the disease caused by Sars-CoV-2. \n What that indicates is that \"every part of the immune system is needed to clear this virus\", according to Mr Stanley Perlman, a professor of immunology at the University of Iowa, whose lab is now replenishing its stock of lab mice genetically engineered for research on immune response to Sars. \n As the body's immune response can be so aggressive, researchers say that the war against the virus can do damage that causes fatal repercussions in the body. \n In particular, Sars-CoV-2 attacks the lungs, an especially sensitive battleground. Also, as the immune system tries to fight a virus that it has never before encountered, it can go into overdrive, causing excessive damage to adjoining cells and tissue. \n The body's early-warning system for invading pathogens was multilayered, Ms Kikkert said. An abnormality inside a cell would typically trigger a \"cascade\" of cell signals. \n She said this led to the production of \"alarm bell\" proteins that warned surrounding cells about the presence of the virus and triggered a flood of immune molecules, creating an \"antiviral state\". \n As more alarms sound throughout the body, the Sars-CoV-2 virus races to propagate and attack more cells. When T-cells arrive to hunt, capture and kill infected cells, the lungs become a battleground, swelling with immune cells, molecules and the fluid that they use to navigate. \n Mr Olinger said that once a T-cell found an infected cell it latched on, \"almost like a Velcro connection\". \"These cells will attach and send molecules that go through that cell and start to kill it,\" he said. \n Meanwhile, antibodies, Y-shaped proteins, also arrive and swarm onto the virus, smothering the spikes it uses to attach to healthy cells. Larger white blood cells called macrophages also sweep in, swallowing big clusters of dead virus particles. \n As this cellular carnage spreads, dead cells pile up in the lungs. \n \"They are clogging the airways and reducing the oxygen flow,\" said Ms Ashley St John, an assistant professor at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore who researches immune pathology. \n \"You need that tissue to be able to stretch and fill with oxygen, but at the same time you are filling it with immune cells and fluid ... it can prevent someone who is trying to breathe from getting enough oxygen,\" she said. \n Some patients who recover from this stage, their lungs can heal. Others may recover, but suffer lasting damage. \n China released data at the end of February that indicates that about 80 per cent of the Sars-CoV-2 infections were mild to moderate, while 14 per cent were severe. The remaining 6 per cent of critical patients may have suffered respiratory failure, septic shock, and multiple organ failure. \n Globally, about 3.4 per cent of infected people might die from a Sars-CoV-2 infection, the World Health Organization (WHO) said last week, although that number may change as disease controls evolve. In China, the fatality rate fell during the course of the outbreak and the increase in infections. \n In interviews, researchers said that the exact way Sars-CoV-2 behaved in the body was still being investigated, but it was clear it took the heaviest toll on the elderly and people with weakened immune systems. \n More than 20 per cent of infected people aged over 80 were likely to die. Death rates for those with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and chronic respiratory disease are double the average rate, according to statistics from the WHO-China Joint Mission on Covid-19 published at the end of February. \n Some researchers suspect that in the \"hide-and-seek\" period, Sars-CoV-2 compromises the early immune response, either by dividing too rapidly for the system to keep up or disrupting the way the immune system regulates itself. \n There was some evidence this can push a panicked system into overdrive and a \"cytokine storm\" follows that causes tissue inflammation. \n \"With a cytokine storm you have a situation where the brakes aren't working and you have all of these [immune] products [going] out of control ... cells infiltrating into the tissue, breakdown of blood vessels,\" St John said. \n As the body sent out alarms for cells to come to fight the virus, too many or the wrong combination could show up, causing excessive tissue damage, Mr Olinger said. \n \"The lung is the worst place to have that happen. Those cells are there to kill, they are there to encapsulate, and control the infection ... over-response can lead to the damage in the lungs. Cells in that region are not able to transfer oxygen ... it can lead to death of the tissue.\" \n An overwhelming immune response could also lead to death itself, researchers said. \n Getting to the bottom of the \"dance\" between the virus and the immune system's response was something that was hard to do without watching it play out in cells and in animals, Mr Olinger said. \n \"The reality is that until you have the virus in hand you really can't answer a lot of those questions,\" he added. \n \"[This virus] turned science upside down on us, because we know more about the genomic sequence now, whereas in the past other outbreaks that would come way after we had grown the virus and played with it in the laboratory, known how it performs in different cell types.\" \n That is the work now facing researchers like those in Mr Perlman's laboratory as they hope to use mice to get a ringside seat to the fight between Sars-CoV-2 and a mammal immune system. \n Such work needed to be done to work out how to build a Sars-CoV-2 vaccine, Mr Perlman said. \n \"How do you make a vaccine that works well if you are not sure what you need to protect a person from infection?\" SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST"}, {"content": "Coronavirus: Brent Oil drops 2% on fears of a drop in demand.

According to the Bavarian State Office for Health and Food Safety (LGL), the 33-year-old was infected by a colleague from China who had come to a training course for the automotive supplier Webasto in the Gauting district of Stockdorf in the Upper Bavarian district of Starnberg last week. The woman had only noticed her infection on January 23 on the return flight to China. The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV can cause a lung disease from which more than 100 people have already died in China, the main country of distribution - most of them were elderly patients with serious pre-existing conditions. The total number of diseases known worldwide has now risen to more than 4,500, in China at least 106 people died of the lung disease. The first coronavirus patient tested positive for the virus on Monday - by then he was back to work. &quot;He&#39;s doing pretty well, he was still working yesterday morning,&quot; said LGL President Andreas Zapf. &quot;He is free of fever and currently has no more respiratory symptoms,&quot; added the treating chief physician Clemens Wendtner from the Schwabing Clinic. The man is in an isolation room, there is no danger to other patients. The people who had contact with the Chinese Webasto employee and the German Webasto employee who fell ill first are under observation, according to LGL, and are called upon not to leave their home. The 33-year-old patient is a family man and, according to the Ministry of Health, his child goes to a daycare center in the Landsberg am Lech district. This is now also under observation, said LGL President Zapf. Initially, nothing was known about the marital status of the three other patients. The head of the Infectious Diseases Taskforce, Martin Hoch, emphasized: \u201cThe number can still rise.\u201d The new 2019-nCoV virus probably originally came from a market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where it probably jumped over to humans from wild animals traded there. According to current estimates by experts, the new lung disease appears to be mild in most cases, possibly even without symptoms. Transmissions before the first symptoms are considered very rare. The first confirmed coronavirus case in Germany may also provide new information about the ways the lung disease is infected. Because the man was infected by the Chinese woman, although she was not showing any symptoms of the disease at the time. The authorities now want to gradually initiate further measures in Bavaria. An official hotline for the Bavarian authorities was set up, and some health insurance companies did the same. At Munich Airport, according to the State Office, passengers are asked with posters in three languages \u200b\u200bto see a doctor if they suspect an infection with the new type of coronavirus. Further escalation stages of the alarm plan are possible: At the moment, together with the federal government, \u201cit can make sense to take a fever at airports\u201d, said Minister Huml. The world&#39;s largest toy fair in Nuremberg expects fewer visitors from China this year in view of the coronavirus outbreak. Despite everything, there is no reason to panic, stressed Huml - as did her colleague, Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU). The case shows &quot;that we are well prepared,&quot; he said. According to the Robert Koch Institute, the risk to people&#39;s health in Germany remains low. Nevertheless, respiratory masks were sold out in individual pharmacies in Bavaria. He had heard this from companies in Lower Franconia and Munich, said a spokesman for the Bavarian Pharmacists&#39; Association of the German Press Agency. The management of Webasto has given the employees at the Stockdorf headquarters free this week whether they want to come to the office or prefer to work at home. Webasto is a major supplier to the automotive industry with 13,400 employees and sales of 3.4 billion euros. The company had already canceled all business trips to China for the next two weeks. BMW, Audi and Siemens also stated that only essential business trips to China will be made. (dpa)"}, {"content": "China confirms nine deaths and 440 cases of the Wuhan coronavirus. The Wuhan virus has outgrown the control of the Chinese authorities. There are already nine fatalities and the number of infected continues to grow with each hour of the day: the latest data speak of 440 patients. To put it in perspective: on Friday there were only 41, and the Municipal Health Commission assured that the medical tests had not yielded positive results since last January 3. The escalation of this new coronavirus, discovered two weeks ago, is reminiscent of that of SARS, with which it bears genetic similarities. The 2002 epidemic, also originating in China, killed 700 people worldwide. Most of the infections (270) are concentrated in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak that emerged in December. From this city, located in the central area of \u200b\u200bthe Chinese territory and home to 11 million people - more than London or New York - the pathogen has begun to spread to neighboring provinces. If last Friday there were no positives out there, today there are 38 cases spread over 15 other large cities. But this data may not be entirely reliable. A model developed by experts from the Center for Infectious Disease Epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong suggests that the reality is even more worrying than official figures reveal. According to its report, prepared in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) and presented this Tuesday, the total number of infected could already touch 1,500: 1,343 in Wuhan and 115 in the rest of the country. Skepticism is logical in the case of a country in which freedom of information does not prevail. Many also remember the precedent of SARS, when the authorities denied the existence of the virus for weeks. The Chinese Communist Party has made reference to the same episode to warn local and regional administrations that they must report accurately on the course of events. &quot;Anyone who does not tell the truth will be nailed to the pillar of shame for all eternity,&quot; proclaimed this Monday Chan An Jian, official profile on social networks of the Central Commission for Political and Legal Affairs, supervisory arm of the Party in legal matters . This ruling is in addition to yesterday&#39;s intervention by Secretary General Xi Jinping, in which he called for \u201ctaking seriously\u201d the containment of the outbreak. There is another reason for the uneasiness: the estimates from the University of Hong Kong model respond to a \u201cmoderate scenario\u201d, in which Wuhan remains the sole focus of the outbreak and highly contagious patients, known as \u201csuper-spreaders\u201d, do not appear. This last risk factor, however, could already be a reality. The WHO yesterday paid a visit to Wuhan together with a group of Chinese health experts, led by Dr. Zhong Nanshan, director of the State Laboratory of Infectious Diseases in Canton and a national eminence in the matter. Their findings show that 15 medical employees in the city have contracted the virus, confirming the possibility of human-to-human transmission - an extreme ruled out until this weekend. 14 of them, in addition, would have been infected by a single patient, as Nanshan revealed yesterday in an interview with national television, which opens the door to the existence of these &quot;super-spreaders.&quot; &quot;The key to controlling the expansion at this time is to prevent its appearance,&quot; said the researcher. Meanwhile, international expansion also continues. To the four cases located to date in Thailand, Japan and South Korea, the first positive in Taiwan has been added this Tuesday. This is a 55-year-old woman who, as in previous cases, also visited Wuhan in recent weeks. &quot;The patient developed symptoms from January 11, but she did not enter a hospital,&quot; Huang Wang-ting, a doctor from the Taiwan Central Epidemic Command, reported this afternoon. The island&#39;s Minister of Health, Chen Shih-chung, has assured that none of the relatives of the patient have any symptoms, similar to those of ordinary pneumonia, and that 46 other people who were in contact with her during the journey from aircraft have been placed under observation. Likewise, the Philippines and Australia have also announced that they have taken action against the first suspected cases in their national territory. The WHO has announced that it will hold an emergency meeting tomorrow Wednesday to decide whether to declare &quot;an international public health emergency&quot; due to the outbreak. The Chinese State Council, for its part, has also scheduled a press conference in which it will detail the evolution of the virus in the last hours."}, {"content": "covid-19: 1 new case confirmed in singapore, 2 more discharged.

The Government of Macau is considering placing more European countries on the list of high epidemic incidence of covid-19 and thus imposing a 14-day quarantine on anyone who has been in those countries. Among those possibilities is the case of Denmark, officials said. On Tuesday, the imposition of a 14-day quarantine came into effect for anyone who had been in Germany, Spain, France or Japan in the 14 days prior to entering Macau. This measure has also been in force for a few weeks for people from South Korea, Italy and Iran. From this Thursday onwards, anyone who has been in Norway in the 14 days prior to entering the territory will be subject to a medical examination. In the past 24 hours, China has registered 15 new cases of covid-19 infection, the lowest number since starting the daily count in January.

BEIJING (AFP) - As the rest of the world is engulfed in the coronavirus pandemic, China says it has turned the tide against the disease that has killed thousands of people. \n From initial attempts to cover up the outbreak to later locking down cities and now declaring it \"basically curbed\", here is a look at how China grappled with Covid-19: \n The first case emerged in the central city of Wuhan on Dec 8 before several workers at Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market began to fall sick with\u00a0fever. \n On Dec 31, Wuhan health authorities announced 27 cases of suspected viral pneumonia linked to the market and notified the World Health Organisation. \n But officials insisted there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission and that it was \"preventable and controllable\". \n A day later, eight people were reprimanded by Wuhan police for \"spreading rumours\" about the then mysterious disease. \n There had been social media talk of a re-emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), another coronavirus\u00a0which killed nearly 650 people in mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. \n Dr Li Wenliang, a 34-year-old ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital, was among those punished for raising the alarm. \n The number of cases in Wuhan jumped to 44 on Jan 3 and health authorities in Hong Kong and Singapore issued travel alerts. \n China announced the existence of a \"new type of coronavirus\" on Jan 9 and the first death two days later. \n But between Jan 5 and Jan 17, China reported no new cases of the virus, while Japan and Thailand declared their first infections. \n During this time, Wuhan and Hubei province pressed ahead with their annual legislative meetings despite the outbreak. \n Meanwhile, doctors were ordered to keep quiet about the virus and evidence of human transmission they had seen, according to an interview with Dr Ai Fen, one of the earliest medical whistle-blowers on the outbreak and a colleague of Dr Li. \n An annual mass banquet for 40,000 families organised by Wuhan authorities went ahead on Jan 18. \n The same day, Beijing sent a team of scientific experts to Wuhan to investigate. \n On Jan 20, President Xi Jinping ordered that the virus be \"resolutely contained\", in his first public comment on the issue. \n Human-to-human transmission was finally confirmed by a leading Chinese expert that day. \n This marked a major turning point in the epidemic, with 291 infections reported nationwide. \n Panic took hold in Wuhan, a city of 11 million, when it was abruptly placed on lockdown on Jan 23. The rest of Hubei province was sealed off in the following days. \n Wuhan hospitals, inundated with patients, reported dire shortages of medical supplies. Many who could not get timely treatment for themselves or relatives relayed personal tragedies on social media. \n The virus spread as hundreds of millions of people travelled across the country and abroad for the Chinese New Year holiday\u00a0before travel curbs were imposed. \n On Jan 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a \"global emergency\". \n Between Feb 1 and Feb 7, cases in China ballooned from 11,791 to 31,161, while deaths reached 636. \n On Feb 7 the Wuhan medical whistle-blower Dr Li died from the coronavirus, triggering a wave of public grief and anger. \n Many grievances against the authorities were swiftly censored on social media. \n Days later, four high-profile local officials were purged and replaced to appease public disquiet - including the Communist Party secretaries of Wuhan and Hubei. \n The province recorded a huge jump of 14,840 new infections on Feb 13 due to a change in diagnostic criteria, raising questions about the credibility of China's data. \n Mr Xi, usually a ubiquitous presence on state media, remained out of the spotlight. \n But on Feb 15, Beijing released a speech by Mr Xi showing he had urged officials to contain the outbreak as early as Jan 7 - well before the authorities announced human-to-human transmission - in an attempt to boost the leader's public image. \n In late February and early March, the number of new cases in Hubei and other parts of China steadily declined as outbreaks flared up in Italy, Iran and South Korea. \n On Tuesday (March 10), Mr Xi visited Wuhan for the first time since the outbreak began, suggesting the Communist Party was confident it had the situation under control. \n Wuhan officials touted the sealing off of all residential estates from Feb 11 as \"critical\" in curbing the spread in the city, although some experts believe it led to more cross-infections within households. \n After more than 4,600 deaths and 126,000 infections across the country, China is now trying to reshape the global narrative in response to overseas criticism, casting itself as a leader in the heroic fight against the virus while other countries struggle to cope."}, {"content": "Stunned world grapples with 'once-in-100-year' coronavirus battle.

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) today revised down 0.5 percentage points to 2.4%, estimates for world growth this year, due to the outbreak of the new coronavirus. &quot;Assuming that epidemic peaks in China in the first quarter of 2020 and outbreaks in other countries prove to be moderate and contained, global growth could be down by about 0.5 percentage points [pp] this year compared to forecasts November 2019 Economic Outlook&quot;, can be read in the interim economic forecast report released today. According to the document known today, the growth of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the euro zone for 2020 was also revised downwards, but by 0.3 pp, being now estimated at 0.8%, in line with the German slowdowns (0.1 pp to 0.3%), France (0.3 pp to 0.9%) and Italy (0.4 pp to a stagnation of economic activity - 0%). The economic growth of the United Kingdom was also revised downwards from 0.2 pp to 0.8%, that of the United States by 0.1 pp to 1.9%, that of Japan by 0.4 pp to 0.2% and South Korea, one of the countries most affected by Covid-19 disease, by 0.3 pp to 2.0%. With regard to China, the OECD forecasts a 0.8 pp reduction in economic growth in 2020, now estimating a 4.9% increase in GDP. Despite a 0.5 pp downward revision of world economic growth in 2020 due to the outbreak of the new coronavirus, the OECD warns that a &quot;longer and more intensive outbreak, extended to the Asia-Pacific, Europe and North America regions would weaken prospects considerably&quot;. &quot;In this case, global growth could drop to 1.5% in 2020, half the number projected before the virus outbreak,&quot; notes the Paris-based organization. Recalling that the Chinese province of Hubei, the source of the new coronavirus, contributes to 4.5% of local production, the OECD highlights that &quot;the declines in production in China were quickly felt by companies around the world, given the key role of China in world production chains as a producer of intermediate goods, particularly computers, electronics, pharmaceuticals and transport equipment&quot;. &quot;Travel restrictions and the cancellation of many visits, flights and work and leisure events are severely affecting many services. This is likely to persist for some time,&quot; according to the OECD, which notes that Chinese tourists account for around 10% of international tourism. The organization chaired by \u00c1ngel Gurr\u00eda also argues, in its report, that &quot;stimulus to macroeconomic policy in the most exposed economies will help to restore confidence, as the effects of the virus outbreak and the disruptions on the supply side fade away&quot;. &quot;Low interest rates should help to dampen demand, although the impact of recent and projected changes in interest rate policy on [economic] activity is likely to remain modest in advanced economies,&quot; according to the OECD.

BEIJING: Yang Zhongyi was still waiting on Monday (Jan 27) for a coronavirus test in the Chinese city of Wuhan two weeks after she started to show signs of a fever, even though doctors privately told her family that she almost certainly has been infected, her son Zhang Changchun told Reuters. \n Yang, 53, is just one of many Wuhan inhabitants finding it difficult to get tested or receive treatment for the new form of coronavirus, which authorities say has infected more than 4,000 people and killed at least 106 in China, a situation that may be contributing to the spread of the disease. \n Yang has been unable to gain full-time admission to a hospital, her son said. She has been put on drips in unquarantined areas at four separate hospitals in the city to treat her deteriorating lungs, he said, while he is doing what he can to get her tested or admitted full-time. \n \"My brother and I have been queuing at the hospital every day. We go at 6 and 7 in the morning, and queue for the whole day, but we don't get any new answers,\" Zhang told Reuters. \"Every time the responses are the same: 'There's no bed, wait for the government to give a notice, and follow the news to see what's going on.' The doctors are all very frustrated too.\" \n Officially known as 2019-nCoV, the new form of coronavirus was first identified as the cause of death of a 61-year-old man in Wuhan on Jan\u00a010, when China shared gene information on the virus with other countries. Some, such as Japan and Thailand, started testing travellers from China for the virus within three days. \n However, testing kits for the disease were not distributed to some of Wuhan's hospitals until about Jan\u00a020, an official at the Hubei Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (Hubei CDC) told Reuters. \n Before then, samples had to be sent to a laboratory in Beijing for testing, a process that took three to five days to get results, according to Wuhan health authorities. \n During that gap, hospitals in the city reduced the number of people under medical observation from 739 to just 82, according to data compiled by Reuters from Wuhan health authorities, and no new cases were reported inside China. \n Despite the lack of reliable data and testing capacity in Wuhan, Chinese authorities assured citizens in the days after the virus had been identified that it was not widely transmissible. \n In previous weeks, it had censored negative online commentary about the situation, and arrested eight people it accused of being \"rumour spreaders\". \n \"The doctor didn\u2019t wear a mask, we didn\u2019t know how to protect ourselves ... no one told us anything,\" a 45-year-old woman surnamed Chen told Reuters. \n Her aunt was confirmed to have the virus on Jan\u00a020, five days after she was hospitalised. \"I posted my aunt\u2019s photos on (Chinese social media site) Weibo and the police called the hospital authorities. They told me to take it down.\" \n National, regional and city health officials did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters on how the virus outbreak has been handled.\u00a0National officials did say at a media briefing last week that there were some \"loopholes\" in initial treatment methods. \n Wuhan's mayor, Zhou Xianwang, told Chinese state television on Monday he recognised that \"all parties were not satisfied with the disclosure of our information\".\u00a0But he pointed to strictures placed upon him by provincial and national leaders. \n \"In local governance, after I receive information, I can only release it when I'm authorised,\" he said. Zhou told a media briefing on Sunday that a further 1,000 people could be diagnosed with the virus in Wuhan, based on the number of patients yet to be tested. \n DELAYED RESPONSE \n China last week locked down the affected region in Hubei province in the biggest quarantine operation on record and is building two new hospitals to treat virus patients. President Xi Jinping has created a special committee to tackle the outbreak. \n The country has been praised internationally for quickly sequencing the virus gene. However, its slow scale-up of testing has been questioned. \n Once a virus has been identified, \"You need to make sure you have all the reagent (a substance used in chemical analysis) samples and you\u2019ve got it all pushed out to where you want to do testing,\" said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, who focuses on emerging infectious disease and pandemic preparedness. \n  \n Although information from the region is scarce, Adalja suggested China has had problems with this stage of tackling the outbreak. \"We\u2019re already hearing that there are shortages of medical professionals there, that there are shortages of test kits and medicines,\" he said. \n John Edmunds, a professor at the centre for mathematical modelling of infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said China has not communicated enough detailed data after the initial outbreak. \n \"We have a very incomplete picture of what\u2019s going on,\" he told Reuters. \"Whether it\u2019s incompetence, secrecy, or deliberate, I don\u2019t know, but it would be very useful if we could have some basic epidemiological data.\" \n The shortage of testing supplies and China's initial reticence have drawn criticism that the country is still learning lessons from the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002 that killed almost 800 people. \n \"The improvements have been on the hard science side - figuring out the virus's genome, building new hospitals at a moment's notice - more than on the soft science side of managing information and dealing with people,\" said Mary Gallagher, a political science professor who leads the University of Michigan's Center for Chinese Studies. \n City managers had little incentive to escalate problems to political superiors. The week in which no new virus cases were reported in Hubei coincided with preparations for Chinese New Year and sessions of the province's National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. \n STILL WAITING \n Seven of the largest hospitals in Wuhan are now equipped with testing kits for the virus, which in theory deliver results within a day, the Hubei CDC official said. \n But four people told Reuters they were refused tests because the process involved a complex reporting system including hospital, district and city health authorities and disease control officials. \n To qualify for the test, patients need to meet certain criteria, such as having symptoms of fever and pneumonia, and a surge in patients means it is \"impossible to conduct the test right away\", an official at the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention told Reuters. \n  \n Three hospital and local government workers, who have been briefed on how doctors are handling tests and confirming cases, told Reuters that official numbers of infections and deaths do not reflect the actual toll. \n Wuhan health authorities have a limit on tests, chiefly because of the shortage of testing kits, and are screening lists of patients before deciding who gets a test, which takes several hours, one hospital worker told Reuters. \n \"Some severely ill patients were left out from the final list for testing because they know they wouldn't be able to be treated,\" the worker told Reuters. \"The actual deaths were higher.\" \n Reuters could not independently confirm the hospital worker's account. Hubei and Wuhan health authorities did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. \n Zhang, whose mother is still waiting for a test, said doctors at three Wuhan hospitals told her family privately that they are almost certain she has contracted the coronavirus. \n However, he said two of those hospitals told him they are not equipped with testing kits, and the other told him it has no available bed to accommodate his mother for the test. \n None of those hospitals replied to Reuters requests for comment. \n Sixty-nine-year-old Xu Enen, who has had fever and a lung infection since Jan\u00a08, was rejected by six hospitals in Wuhan for testing as they said they had run out of beds, his daughter told Reuters. Xu's symptoms have worsened lately, and he is starting to have breathing difficulties. \n He was finally admitted on Jan\u00a022 to queue for the test at Hankou hospital in Wuhan after his daughter publicised his case on Weibo. \n Researchers at Lancaster University estimate that only 5.1 per cent of infections in Wuhan have been identified. By Jan\u00a021, they estimated a total of 11,341 people had been infected in Wuhan since the start of the year. More than 30,000 people in Wuhan are under observation, according to the city's health authorities. \n \"All we want is to confirm the case is the virus or not,\" said a 33-year-old Wuhan woman surnamed Liu, whose father has been on a respirator in hospital since Jan\u00a014 and was still untested on Monday. \"At least if it's confirmed we have a direction.

SHANGHAI/WASHINGTON - The United States ramped up its response to the coronavirus epidemic on Friday, declaring a public health emergency and saying it would halt entry to foreign nationals who had been to China within the 14-day incubation period.  \n That measure followed on from an earlier travel advisory that warned Americans not to travel to China and angered Beijing.  \n Originating in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the flu-like virus first identified earlier in January has resulted in 213 deaths in China, according to local health authorities. Wuhan and the surrounding region of Hubei are in virtual quarantine.  \n More than 9,800 people have been infected in China and more than 130 cases reported in at least 25 other countries and regions, with Russia, Britain, Sweden and Italy all reporting their first cases on Thursday or Friday.  \n The World Health Organization said on Thursday that the epidemic constituted a public health emergency of international concern, a designation that triggers tighter global containment measures and coordination.  \n \"Following the World Health Organization's decision... I have today declared that the coronavirus presents a public health emergency in the United States,\" U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar said at a public briefing on Friday afternoon.  \n As of Sunday, U.S. citizens who had been in Hubei would be subject to compulsory quarantine, he said. Foreign nationals - aside from the immediate family of citizens and residents - who had travelled in China in the last 14 days would be denied entry, said Azar.  \n \"The risk is low in the United States... but our job is to keep that risk low as much as we can,\" he said.  \n The move will likely anger Beijing, which has only just started to mend tattered trade ties with Washington. Earlier on Friday, it criticized the U.S. travel warning.  \n \"The World Health Organization urged countries to avoid travel restrictions, but very soon after that, the United States did the opposite,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said. \"It's truly mean.\"  \n Other countries have also advised citizens to put off non-urgent travel to China or restricted flights. After reporting its first two cases of the illness, Russia on Friday restricted direct flights to China, its biggest trade partner.  \n Singapore, a major travel hub in Asia, stopped entry of passengers with a recent history of travel to China and also suspended visas for Chinese passport holders.  \n Many airlines have chosen to cancel or reduce flights, with airline crews pressuring carriers to act.  \n Governments around the world are evacuating citizens from Hubei. A plane with 83 British and 27 foreign nationals landed in Britain on Friday, while Japan, with 14 confirmed cases, has sent three flights to bring citizens home.  \n The United States said it would channel all flights from China through seven airports. It has put 195 Americans evacuated to California this week in quarantine.  \n The virus has an incubation of between one and 14 days, and there are some limited signs it may also be able to spread before any symptoms show.  \n  \n GLOBAL REVERBERATIONS  \n With major fallout inevitable for China's economy, which is the world's second largest, global shares posted their biggest weekly and monthly losses since August on Friday. [MKTS/GLOB]  \n The outbreak could \"reverberate globally,\" Moody's said.  \n In the latest impact to big name corporations, South Korea's Hyundai Motor <005380.KS> said it planned to halt production of a sport utility vehicle this weekend due to a supply disruption caused by the outbreak.  \n Home appliance maker Electrolux <ELUXb.ST> issued a similar warning, French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen <PEUP.PA> said its three plants in Wuhan will remain closed until mid-February, and tractor maker Deere & Co <DE.N> said it was temporarily shutting its facilities in China.  \n WHO's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has said the WHO did not support travel or trade curbs. Tedros reiterated in a series of tweets on Friday that his organization had confidence in China's capacity to control the 2019-nCoV virus.  \n \"Travel restrictions can cause more harm than good by hindering info-sharing and medical supply chains and harming economies. We urge countries and companies to make evidence-based, consistent decisions.\"  \n  \n VIRUS EPICENTRE  \n The roughly 60 million residents of Hubei province, where Wuhan is the capital, have had movements curbed to try and slow the spread of the disease. But some people were leaving and entering the area by foot on a bridge over the Yangtze river, a Reuters witness said, and infections have jumped in two cities flanking Wuhan.  \n China's statistics show just over 2% of infected people have died, suggesting the virus is less deadly than the 2002-2003 outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).  \n But economists say its financial impact could be bigger than SARS, which killed about 800 people at an estimated cost of $33 billion to the global economy, since China's share of the world economy is now far greater.  \n Like other respiratory infections, the coronavirus spreads between people in droplets from coughs and sneezes. No deaths have been reported outside China, but it is still too early to know what its death rate will be.  \n \"The issue now with this is that there's a lot of unknowns,\" said U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention head Robert Redfield.  \n The WHO has reported at least eight cases of human-to-human transmission - as opposed to people coming infected from China - in four countries: the United States, Germany, Japan and Vietnam. Thailand said it too had such a case.  \n Graphic - Tracking China\u2019s novel coronavirus: https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-HEALTH-MAP/0100B59S39E/index.html  \n Graphic - The Coronavirus Outbreak: https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-HEALTH/0100B59Y39P/index.html REUTERS"}, {"content": "Scientists identify two types of Covid-19 virus.

The remarks by Mr Du Bin, chairman of the critical care medical branch of the Chinese Medical Association, are the most conclusive assessment of the virus' incubation period by a government-affiliated medical body. \n The revelations came amid a fall in new cases following crippling restrictions imposed on the world's second-largest economy to stop its spread. \n China had 119 new confirmed cases of coronavirus on Tuesday, the National Health Commission said, down from 125 the previous day, in a broad trend that has seen numbers of new cases fall from the middle of last month. \n The total number of cases on the mainland has now reached 80,270. The number of deaths rose by 38 to bring the total toll for China to 2,981 by Tuesday.

From Brussels, where the health ministers of the 27 met this Thursday to discuss the situation, a message of calm and thought was sent out, aimed at countering the alarmism that resurfaced after China&#39;s increase in the number of new cases of infection with coronavirus. \u201cThe risk here is very low\u201d, dedramatized the European Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenarcic. \u201cBut the risk is there, and so we are preparing for all scenarios\u201d, he guaranteed. Preparation presupposes the sharing of information between national authorities and the coordination of strategies and operational and logistical means \u2014 for example, ministers discussed the possibility of joint purchases of personal protective equipment, or even the possible application of questionnaires for identification of the last contacts of travelers coming from certain spaces. A measure that, according to the Minister of Health, Marta Temido, was already being studied by the Directorate-General for Health.

The same cautious posture of the ministers of health was adopted by the European Commissioner for the Economy, Paolo Gentiloni, who in the presentation of the economic forecasts for the winter referred to the coronavirus as one of the uncertainties and risks that could negatively affect the performance of the euro zone (alongside , for example, from \u201cBrexit\u201d and commercial tensions). Gentiloni recalled that the epidemic led several international companies to suspend the operation of their units in China, which compromises the production chain of several industries in European territory.

A genetic study released this Wednesday confirms that the new coronavirus originating in China was transmitted to humans through a wild animal, as yet unknown, that was infected by bats. The study, conducted by Chinese scientists including from the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, analyzed the coronavirus genome of nine patients diagnosed with viral pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, where the outbreak began in December. The work, published in the British medical publication The Lancet and which validates in the laboratory a thesis assumed by experts, suggests that the new coronavirus, provisionally designated by the World Health Organization as &quot;2019-nCoV&quot;, had as its initial host a bat and was transmitted to people through an as-yet-unknown wild animal that was sold at the Huanan live animal market in Wuhan, capital of Hubei province in central China. Although cautiously, the study authors admit that the new coronavirus is not the result of a genetic mutation of another coronavirus, but may have entered human cells in the same way as the coronavirus that caused the also identified Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). for the first time in China, in 2002 and 2003. The researchers analyzed genome samples (genetic information) of &quot;2019-nCoV&quot; - eight complete sequences and two partial - collected from the nine patients with viral pneumonia. Eight of the patients attended the Huanan market, the rest stayed in a nearby hotel before falling ill. According to the scientific team, the samples of the genetic sequences are almost identical, so the coronavirus would have emerged in humans very recently and was quickly detected. This Wednesday, China raised to 132 dead and more than 5,900 infected the balance of victims of the new coronavirus identified at the end of the year in Wuhan.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The emergence of a new virus in central China has brought back painful memories of another virulent respiratory disease that wreaked worldwide havoc and left the country\u2019s health authorities struggling to rebuild public trust.\nBut global health experts said China has come a long way since 2003, when it was accused of trying to cover up a major outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a previously unknown virus believed to have emerged from the wet markets of Guangdong province before spreading into major cities. As many as 774 people died in an epidemic that reached nearly 30 countries.\nNow, nearly 17 years later, government officials insist they have learned from past mistakes as they try to contain the latest deadly viral pneumonia strain, which has infected 440 people, mostly in Wuhan city, and killed nine since it was first identified at the end of last month.\nLiu Heng, an adviser to China\u2019s cabinet said it took the country about four or five months to announce the SARS outbreak to the public, and this time it had taken less than a month.\n\u201cWe are doing much better now...

Local governments were also reluctant to take responsibility for the rapid spread of infections.\nBeijing has since established the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention that hooks up hospitals and clinics nationwide and reports outbreaks in real time. It has also set up specific mechanisms for new pneumonia strains.\n\u201cChina... has developed excellent disease surveillance systems since SARS, including real-time emergency department surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections, so this will help with rapid identification of new cases,\u201d said Raina MacIntyre, head of the biosecurity research programme at the Kirby Institute in Sydney.\nVice-minister Li said China\u2019s health infrastructure was also now better able to cope, with the country ready to deploy several \u201cback-up\u201d hospitals that could be put into action should the number of infected people spike further.\nThe silence on the part of authorities during the early stages of SARS helped create a rumor mill that sparked panic in several major cities and brought the economy to a standstill. One estimate suggested China\u2019s economy slowed by around 1-2 percentage points in 2003 as a result of SARS.\nThis time, officials have been warned they face public ignominy if they cover up any infections, and the message throughout state media has been about the need for greater transparency.

But several countries, including Australia, the United States and Singapore have simply banned foreign nationals who have recently been to China from entering their territory. They also recommend that no nationals from these countries visit China during the alert period.

SINGAPORE \u2014 Almost three times\u00a0more cases of the Covid-19 virus could have been found globally if the rest of the world possessed the same \u201cgold standard\u201d detection capability as Singapore, a study by Harvard University researchers has found. \n \u201cWe consider the detection of 18 cases by Feb 4, 2020 in Singapore to be a gold standard of near-perfect detection,\u201d said the report\u2019s authors, adding that they had used a model to estimate the probability of detection in other countries relative to Singapore. \n The world is detecting imported cases of Covid-19 at 38 per cent of Singapore\u2019s ability to do so, said four epidemiologists from the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health in the study, that has not yet been peer-reviewed. \n \u201cSingapore has historically had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact-tracing capacity and has shown in the Covid-19 epidemic evidence of a high sensitivity of case detection,\u201d said the researchers. \n The pre-print report, which was uploaded on online medical archive medRxiv, looked at aggregated data of imported cases as of Feb 4 from the World Health Organization (WHO), taking into account 191 territories around the world. \n Imported cases are those with known travel history from China. \n The researchers also compared the records with air travel data from various sources, including the International Air Travel Association, and the surveillance capacity of nations based on the Global Health Security Index (GHSI) by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which last year ranked Singapore\u2019s preparedness for major disease outbreaks below Malaysia and Thailand. \n Using a model to determine how well countries have detected imported cases, the researchers picked Singapore as a benchmark based on its demonstrated ability to pick up confirmed carriers of Sars-CoV-2, the technical name of the virus which causes the disease Covid-19. \n They also cited a previous study, also by a similar team of Harvard researchers, which found that among countries with substantial travel volume, Singapore had \u201cthe highest ratio of detected imported cases to daily travel volume\u201d. \n The previous study named Singapore as a statistical anomaly which had 12 more reported import cases than what had been expected, based on daily travel volume. \n The same report uploaded online last Tuesday had suggested that Indonesia, which has not detected any cases of Covid-19 so far, might have missed cases. The report was called \u201cinsulting\u201d by Indonesian Health Minister Terawan Agus Putranto earlier this week. \n Harvard Professor Marc Lipsitch said in response to the criticism that the academics had meant to be \u201chelpful\u201d and had conducted the study to see if the total number of detected cases was representative of the actual incidence of Covid-19. \n In the latest study, the researchers, including Prof Lipsitch who was involved in both studies, said their model is 95 per cent statistically reliable. \n The researchers said their model in the latest study is 95 per cent statistically reliable. \n High surveillance countries, such as Thailand, Australia and South Korea, came in at 40 per cent of the city-state\u2019s ability to detect imported cases, the study concluded. Low surveillance ones, such as several African and Middle Eastern nations, achieve just 11 per cent of Singapore\u2019s capacity. \n \u201cPut another way, this implies that the true number of cases in travellers is at least 2.8 times the number that has been detected,\u201d the study said. \n However, Singapore\u2019s detection is \u201cprobably not 100 per cent efficient\u201d, and the model was also able to estimate that there are around 1.8 undetected cases for every detected Covid-19 patient in the city-state. \n It noted the number of Singapore cases that have no known links to China or any recent travel history. \u201cSingapore\u2019s detection like that in other countries has relied largely on symptoms and travel history, so the number of asymptomatic or low-severity cases missed by such a strategy is unknown,\u201d the authors said. \n What the study implies is that the true number of Covid-19 cases could be higher than previously thought, they added. \n The model proves that the number of undetected cases of coronavirus is correlated to air travel connectivity and is inverse to a country\u2019s detection capacity \u2014 and that the risks of the virus going undetected could happen anywhere around the world. \n \u201c(This could lead) to the potential risk of self-sustained transmission, which may be an early stage of a global pandemic,\u201d the study said."}, {"content": "Portugal has two more ambulances dedicated to suspected cases of coronavirus.

The announcement was made this Thursday, at a press conference, by the president of INEM Lu\u00eds Meira. Portugal now has four ambulances to transport suspected cases. &quot;We have both ambulances prepared in Porto and Lisbon, and since yesterday [Wednesday] we have reinforced this possibility [of response] with two more teams in Coimbra and Faro, in case we have new cases&quot;, said the official , noting that everything was done in \u201cstrict articulation\u201d with the Directorate-General for Health (DGS).

Lu\u00eds Meira explained that at the time the firefighters went to the factory where the Italian technician was, this was not yet a validated case and there was an indication that he would have breathing difficulties. Therefore, he said, the priority was to respond immediately to the patient. And that, when the case was validated, he was in isolation and was referred to the referral hospital.

Gra\u00e7a Freitas reinforced that the case in Porto \u201cwas duly referred from a clinical and public health point of view\u201d, having arrived at the hospital it was supposed to, hospitalized in isolation and with tests carried out by the reference laboratory. \u201cWhat went less well? The social tranquility part\u201d, he assumed. \u201cOne could have talked to people first and reassure them. But the first priority is to get the patient to the right hospital and safely\u201d, he said, noting that \u201csometimes the validation processes are complex\u201d. And because of that, it takes longer until a validation is given or not. And he rejected the criticisms made in the article. \u201cWe were prepared in the past and we are now. The proof is that we found suspicious cases, validated them and forwarded them to the right hospitals. The three other situations, as you know, arrived quickly and exemplarily at the respective hospital. From a case deducing that we are not prepared, it does not seem to me that this is the most correct question\u201d, said Gra\u00e7a Freitas, referring that the issue of social tranquility \u201cwill have to be taken care of in future interventions\u201d. The 20 returnees from the Chinese city of Wuhan are now all together in Pulido Valente hospital, after the group asked to stay in the same space. And from this Thursday, between 10 am and 5 pm, they will be able to come outside in a space reserved for them and complying with safety rules with the use of a mask. The repetition of the analyzes will be carried out &quot;close to the end of the period of prophylactic isolation&quot;, said the Director-General of Health.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. public health officials said they have identified four \u201cpresumptive\u201d coronavirus cases believed to have emerged from community transmission of the infection, signaling a turning point in efforts to contain the disease in the United States.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a statement on Friday citing three such cases newly diagnosed by state public health authorities - one each in California, Oregon and Washington state.\nIf confirmed by the CDC, together with a previous case of unknown origin announced on Wednesday in California, that would bring to four the number of diagnosed individuals in the United States with no history of travel to a country where the virus is circulating and no close contact with an infected person.\nThe three latest patients were diagnosed based on results obtained in their respective states from CDC-supplied test kits and are considered \u201cpresumptive positive\u201d cases pending CDC confirmatory testing, the U.S. agency said.\nA fourth presumptive positive was also announced in Washington state on Friday, but that one is \u201clikely travel-related,\u201d the CDC said.\nStill, the three latest cases of apparent community transmission, plus the one identified earlier this week in California, are a sign the virus is now spreading within at least four separate locations up and down the U.S. West Coast.\nThey span nearly 900 miles from California\u2019s Silicon Valley region in Santa Clara County north to the Puget Sound near Seattle.\n\u201cWhat we know now is that the virus is here, present at some level, but we still don\u2019t know to what degree,\u201d said Dr. Sara Cody, the chief public health officer for Santa Clara County, speaking of the newly diagnosed case there, the latest of three in her county and the 10th statewide.\nEven as confirmation was pending there, the CDC sent a team to assist local authorities in tracing close contacts the patient had with others in a bid to curb transmission.\nUntil this week, the CDC had counted 15 confirmed cases in six states as having been detected through the U.S. public health system since Jan. 21, none fatal. Most were contracted by individuals while traveling in China, where the outbreak originated. Only two person-to-person transmissions were documented among them, both between married couples.\nAn additional 47 cases have been confirmed among people recently repatriated from abroad, either from the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan or from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak, according to the CDC.\nThe latest flurry of cases came as the Trump administration said the United States would invoke a federal defense law to boost production of masks, gloves, gowns and other items needed to protect medical personnel from exposure.\nAround the world, more countries are reporting new infections, companies have curtailed travel and global stock markets have tumbled.\nPresident Donald Trump said at the White House on Friday the United States will decide \u201cvery soon\u201d about whether to bar entry to travelers from countries other than China where community transmission has emerged.\nAt a rally in South Carolina on Friday night, Trump defended his administration\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak and accused Democrats of politicizing the disease.\n\u201cThis is their new hoax,\u201d Trump said at the event, held a day before the state\u2019s Democratic presidential primary.\nThe U.S. State Department has issued travel advisories for several nations and on Friday it said Americans should reconsider travel to Italy, where nearly 900 coronavirus cases have been confirmed. A similar warning was issued earlier this week for South Korea, which has hundreds of infections.\nA government task force appointed by Trump to deal with the threat will meet at the White House on Saturday morning, according to an administration official.\nLatest figures from China, where the outbreak started late last year, indicated that nearly 80,000 people have been infected, with more than 2,800 deaths. The World Health Organization reported 57 deaths in 46 other countries.\nDr. Anthony Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a closed-door briefing in the U.S. House of Representatives that sustained spread of the coronavirus meant there would be many more infections in the United States, according to a source.\nFauci warned lawmakers the country lacked enough testing resources, the source said on condition of anonymity. The CDC said it has revised its criteria for who should be tested and is ramping up testing capabilities.\n\u201cOur goal is to have every state and local health department online and doing their own testing by the end of next week,\u201d CDC official Nancy Messonier told reporters.\nA vaccine may take up to 18 months to develop, health officials have said.\nThe United States has decided to postpone a meeting with leaders of Southeast Asian countries it had planned to host on March 14 in Las Vegas because of worries about the outbreak.\nU.S. and global stocks plummeted as rattled investors braced for the prospect that a pandemic could further dent an already slowing world economy.\nThe S&P 500 .SPX fell for the seventh straight day on Friday, suffering its biggest weekly drop since the 2008 global financial crisis. Stocks cut losses right at the end of the session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 1.4%.\nTrump this week said the coronavirus risk to Americans remained \u201cvery low,\u201d but he has been increasingly alarmed by the reaction of the U.S. stock market, which he considers a barometer of the economy\u2019s health.\n(GRAPHIC - Tracking the novel coronavirus: here)"}, {"content": "Quarantine in Wuhan: trapped in the epicenter of the coronavirus. This morning, the streets in Wuhan are lightly traveled. A blanket of pollution covers the sky, making it look gray and thick. At ten in the morning of this Thursday, three in the morning in mainland Spain, the veto announced this Wednesday by the local authorities came into force. From that moment, and until further notice, the 11 million people who are within the population cannot leave it, nor can anyone enter, which makes this municipality in central China a closed city. The Chinese Government intends, in this way, to stop the spread of the newly discovered coronavirus 2019-nCoV, which has made significant progress in recent days, both outside and within its borders. The most recent data place the cases at 18 dead and about 634 infected. This measure affects all flights, trains and buses, as well as the metro service. At Yunfei station, for example, they have placed a gate at all but one of the entrances. There, a security guard who prefers not to reveal his name comments, a little before the lockdown came into effect at ten in the morning, that the number of people is much less than a normal day. He confesses &quot;eager to go home.&quot; The ban also affects intercity taxis, although you can see some on the street, and in Didi - a phone app similar to Uber - there are no drivers available. The highways have been cut off, so private cars cannot leave the city either. This blockade is one of the measures included in the most serious action protocol, the implementation of which was announced on Wednesday by the State Council, although the scenario is still classified as a level B infectious disease, the second highest. Another of the precepts contemplated is the mobilization of the armed forces. A nearby city, Huanggang, located 70 kilometers from Wuhan, will also close public bus and train services at the end of Thursday, its mayor announced. The authorities have also decreed the closure of entertainment venues in the town, of 7.5 million inhabitants, such as cinemas or Internet cafes, and have asked the population not to leave it except for special circumstances, Reuters reports. The relatively smaller Ezhou, with a population of one million residents, will do the same. At the announcement of the siege in Wuhan, a large number of people headed to the airport and train stations with the intention of leaving the city before it took effect. One of them was Niki, a 22-year-old Taiwanese student who had come to Wuhan to visit a friend of hers. Niki expressed the conviction that she would be able to arrive on time, since she had found a private driver willing to take her. &quot;I&#39;ve come to the wrong place!&quot; She said goodbye to her as she ran down the street pushing her suitcases. Wuhan airport has been saturated, with check-in queues of up to 100 meters, according to local media. With this decision, the Government intends to isolate the population, the epicenter of the outbreak, something particularly important given the proximity of the Chinese New Year. This holiday, which will take place next Saturday, is followed by a week of national holidays in which people usually visit relatives in other parts of the country or travel abroad. These days displacements can reach the figure of 3,000 million, in what constitutes the largest human migration in the world. Wuhan, home to 11 million people - more than London or New York - is also a hub in Chinese rail communications. Already this Thursday, in an unusual contrast, the windows of many establishments in the city show off the typical decorations of these dates despite being mostly empty. Therefore, the instructions of Zhong Nanshan, the scientist who leads the team that tries to defeat the coronavirus, are followed. &quot;From the moment that human-to-human transmission is proven [an extreme ruled out until this week], quarantine should be the first priority,&quot; he declared at a press conference on Tuesday. Zhong, 84, is China&#39;s top infectious disease eminence, and he rose to prominence in 2002 by leading the government&#39;s response to SARS. This epidemic, also originating in China and which killed 700 people around the world after becoming a global crisis, is marked in the memory of the population. &quot;Quarantine is the most effective measure because at the moment we have not developed a specific drug to deal with the coronavirus,&quot; stated the researcher. Another of the requirements established by the local authorities in Wuhan is to make the use of masks mandatory in public spaces. This object has become the first line of defense against the outbreak and nobody moves without it. In many of the supermarkets, on the other hand, perfectly stocked, the shelf corresponding to the masks is empty. \u201cThey have all been sold, even those in the warehouse. I don&#39;t know when they will bring more, \u201dpointed out a clerk from a store on Qinghuang Street, five kilometers from the center, protected with his. But with the growing number of cases, hospitals seem to be unable to cope. The Beijing News newspaper reported that many of them are saturated with patients, some of whom are queuing outside despite the low temperatures. Transfusion rooms are also crowded, with many patients crowding, hooked up to their droppers, into the corridor. \u201cMy father has had a high fever and respiratory problems since last January 2. After several treatments did not work, on the 10th the hospital informed us that they could not admit him because they did not have free beds. They transferred us to the Wuhan Xinhua Hospital and could not treat him there either. His condition has worsened, he has already had a high fever for 12 days and every day he has to walk to the health center to get oxygen: no admission, no exams, no quarantine, &quot;a user denounced on Weibo - a social network similar to Twitter. -. The arrivals area of \u200b\u200bthe Wuhan airport was deserted on Wednesday night. One of the last flights of the day carried only two dozen passengers, all protected with their mask. One of them was Xian Pin, 28, an employee of a financial firm, who was heading to the city because of a professional commitment. \u201cIt&#39;s very important, if it were anything else I wouldn&#39;t have come. I have chosen to limit my travel to the maximum, so tomorrow I will fly back home. I&#39;m very worried \u201d, he pointed out. Faced with the imposition of the veto, Xian Pin most likely failed to achieve his purpose. In the same plane, the flight attendant Lian shared that the flights have experienced a notable decrease in the number of passengers. She herself is from Wuhan, although she quoted a popular saying to illustrate her tranquility: &quot;Shi fu bushi huo, shi huo duo buguo&quot;, &quot;a blessing is not a curse, and a curse has no escape.&quot; On the outskirts of the airport, where there were no exceptional security measures, the driver Zheng Wang complained: &quot;I have been standing in line for five hours, no passengers are coming, so we are not moving.&quot; His 13-year-old son has not been to school since January 10 because classes have been suspended. Asked about the credibility he gives to the official numbers of those affected, he replies: &quot;It&#39;s better not to talk about that.&quot; The Government has threatened to punish anyone who contributes to spreading rumors and local or regional administrations that make up the reality. Despite his unease, Xian Pin was optimistic. He does not remember the SARS epidemic because he &quot;was too small&quot;, but he is sure that this time it will not be so serious. \u201cChina is now a powerful country, and our leader Xi Jinping has addressed the people to ensure that our best minds are working on it. I am confident that we will soon bring the virus under control \u201d."}, {"content": "Covid-19: How big is the risk in Germany? With the surprisingly large Covid-19 outbreak in Italy, concerns about new cases in Germany are increasing. According to experts, chains of infection that initially remain unnoticed are also possible in this country. This is known about the Sars-CoV-2 virus and the Covid-19 disease it causes: How contagious is the new coronavirus? A value of how many other people an infected person infects on average can still not be given with certainty. It is clear that the virus spreads through droplet infection - for example when coughing and speaking. And it is also clear that the pathogen is significantly more infectious than initially assumed: Unlike the closely related Sars pathogen, the Covid-19 virus also multiplies in the throat area. In the upper respiratory tract, the path of infection is significantly shorter than when a pathogen first has to get out of the lungs and into the lungs of another person. Influenza viruses also multiply in the throat. In addition, initial results indicate that the virus can also be spread via the digestive system and for at least a few days via surfaces. According to Clemens Wendtner, chief physician of infectious diseases and tropical medicine at the Munich Clinic Schwabing, a previously underestimated risk may be that \u201cquite relevant amounts\u201d of Sars-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples from patients in the initial phase of Covid-19 disease , explained. The extent to which largely or completely symptom-free people can be infectious is not yet clear. How great is the risk of infection in Germany? With the large number of detected infections in Italy, the risk of Covid-19 being brought into Germany increases due to travel. The risk that clusters similar to those in Italy could occur elsewhere in Europe is currently considered to be moderate to high, according to the European prevention authority ECDC on Sunday evening. Once introduced, the virus can spread quickly. ECDC Director Andrea Ammon said that it is expected that there will be more cases in Italy and possibly other parts of the EU in the coming days. Experts assume that there could long have been other chains of infection in European countries that no one has suspected - including in Germany. &quot;At some point it will likely happen that unnoticed infections will suddenly be noticed,&quot; the Berlin virologist Christian Drosten recently explained. What would an outbreak in Germany mean? A wave of infections in this country could mean, among other things, full waiting areas and doctor&#39;s offices, occupied intensive care beds and completely overloaded health departments, said the Berlin virologist Christian Drosten recently. The CEO of the Charit\u00e9, Heyo Kroemer, emphasized in mid-February that they were preparing intensively. The hospital system generally runs at full load in winter - but in the case of Sars-CoV-2 infections in this country, the facilities would have leeway, for example by postponing non-urgent operations. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) said that the goal in Germany was to postpone a wave of illnesses in order to prevent the Covid-19 and the current flu wave from coinciding. &quot;We have to try to slow down the spread with reasonable effort in order to reduce an intense stress pulse on the health system,&quot; explained Drosten. \u201cThe number of infections should be extended over as long as possible.\u201d How dangerous is the virus? According to an analysis presented by China&#39;s health authority, 2.3 percent of those infected with Sars-CoV-2 die in the country. The elderly and those with serious pre-existing conditions such as cardiovascular diseases or diabetes are particularly affected. For people over 80 years of age, the death rate calculated from the data available there is just under 15 percent, so an average of around 15 out of 100 infected people in this age group in China die. In the group of 10 to 39 year olds, 0.2 percent of those infected die, i.e. around 2 out of 1,000 people affected. In the vast majority of cases - more than 80 percent according to the health authority - people who have contracted the Covid 19 pathogen show only mild symptoms. Almost 14 percent of those affected develop severe symptoms such as shortness of breath, and almost 5 percent life-threatening effects such as respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure. The Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) also spoke of a good 80 percent mild infection processes with reference to the data analysis from China. There are also relatively few cases in children, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. It is still unclear why that is. Experts assume that the mortality is actually lower than calculated in China, among other things because the Chinese statistics do not even record many mild infections. So far, however, there are no reliable analyzes of mortality from other countries. What symptoms does the new coronavirus cause? Many people have only mild cold symptoms with chills and a sore throat or no symptoms at all. In addition, there can be a fever, cough and breathing problems, such as those that occur with the flu. Headaches or diarrhea are also possible. The incubation period - the period between infection and the onset of symptoms - is usually 2 to 14 days according to the current status. That is why suspected cases are isolated for two weeks. How can the new lung disease be treated? There is no special therapy for Covid-19. Seriously ill patients are treated symptomatically: with antipyretic agents, therapy for any additional bacterial infections and sometimes mechanical ventilation. Is there a protective vaccination? No. A number of laboratories around the world are currently researching vaccines such as those used for flu. However, developing a vaccine takes a long time. The first experimental vaccines could be available this year, said the virologist Gerd Sutter from the Ludwig Maximilians University in Munich recently. Whether and when they could be tested on humans is a different matter. &quot;Developing a vaccine is a long and arduous process, especially the approval and clinical testing of a candidate.&quot; WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan believes that initial vaccine tests in humans could begin in three to four months. A certified vaccine for widespread use will probably only be available in 18 months. Do we already have a pandemic with Covid-19? A pandemic is often understood to mean the spread of a disease in humans across all continents. A region is considered \u201caffected\u201d if there are chains of transmission there - and not just individual introductions by travelers. There are still no reports of such chains of infection from Africa and America. For certain African and South American countries in particular, the question is whether tests are carried out for the virus and cases are detected, explained the Berlin virologist Christian Drosten. The World Health Organization (WHO) no longer uses the term pandemic and does not explain it either. She only measures the seriousness of an epidemic by declaring an \u201cemergency of international concern\u201d. This has nothing to do with the common definition of a pandemic. What kind of virus is Sars-CoV-2? The Sars-2-CoV pathogen, which probably spread to humans in November or December at a wildlife market in Wuhan, China, is one of the coronaviruses. They are so named because of the jagged structures on their surface. Seven representatives of this group cause respiratory diseases in humans, including a runny nose or cough. Including Sars-CoV-2, three are known to cause severe symptoms at times. In the case of the Sars virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome), also from China, around 8,000 cases were known in 2002/2003, and around 800 people died. In 2012, the Mers virus (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) appeared in the Middle East. It is less contagious, but more aggressive: of around 2500 people infected by November 2019, just under 860 died - around one in three. The Covid-19 pathogen Sars-CoV-2 is genetically very closely related to the Sars pathogen Sars-CoV, which is why it has received the very similar technical name. How can I protect myself? To protect against this and other viruses, experts recommend normal hygiene measures: regular hand washing, disinfectants and distance from the sick. Experts estimate the benefits of normal breathing masks - as can currently be seen everywhere on the streets in China - to be rather low. It can be useful to limit hugs and handshakes and not to touch surfaces that have been touched by many people, such as doorknobs, handles and elevator buttons. What is the use of a face mask? &quot;Healthy people who are out and about in Germany do not need a mask,&quot; said a spokesman for the Federal Association of German Pharmacists&#39; Associations (ABDA). A simple mouth and nose mask, such as that worn by nurses and doctors during interventions, does not protect against infection with the new Sars-CoV-2 virus. There are also real breathing masks with built-in filters. Infection through droplet transmission can only prevent so-called FFP2 and FFP3 masks - if they are properly seated. &quot;In everyday life, however, that makes no sense,&quot; said Bernd Salzberger from the Regensburg University Hospital, chairman of the German Society for Infectious Diseases. Especially since it is difficult to breathe with a mask like this. Because of the new type of corona virus, protective masks have been sold out in many pharmacies for weeks - and they are hardly getting any replenishment. This is explained by the Federal Association of Pharmaceutical Wholesalers (PHAGRO). When do you test for coronavirus? In the routine monitoring of acute respiratory diseases in Germany with the help of selected medical practices, attention is now also being paid to the novel coronavirus. As the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) in Berlin announced on Monday, the Influenza Working Group (AGI) has &quot;integrated an investigation into Sars-CoV-2 into the spectrum of pathogens to be examined&quot;. According to the RKI, airway samples from patients from 100 to 150 medical practices are now also being analyzed to this effect. The MDR had previously reported on the subject. The year-round monitoring by the AGI includes, among other things, the course and severity of the respiratory diseases as well as the characteristics of the respective circulating pathogens. Trends are to be identified on the basis of the random sample of the participating medical practices. The main issue is the flu, which affects thousands of people in Germany every year. Among other things, tests are carried out for rhinoviruses, which are often the cause of colds and colds. Where can I get the latest information? The Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the Federal Center for Health Education (BZgA) and the Federal Ministry of Health (BMG) have set up corresponding websites. (dpa)"}, {"content": "Wuhan virus: What we know about the outbreak so far. SINGAPORE: A new strain of coronavirus has infected hundreds of people in China and overseas, killing more than 20 people since it was reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan earlier this month. \n Here is what we know about the outbreak so far: \n IT IS SIMILAR, BUT SO FAR MILDER THAN SARS \n The pathogen appears to be a new strain of coronavirus, a family of viruses that can cause diseases such as the common cold and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed hundreds in mainland China and Hong Kong between 2002 and 2003. \n It has been named \"2019-nCoV\". \n Arnaud Fontanet, head of the department of epidemiology at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, told AFP that the new strain was 80 per cent genetically identical to SARS. \n The symptoms caused by the new virus appears to be less aggressive as compared to SARS, according to an AFP report. These include fever, difficulty breathing and coughing. \n However, its milder nature can also cause alarm as it allows more people to travel further before symptoms can be detected, the director of the Institute of Global Health Antoine Flahault said. \n SUSPECTED TO HAVE ORIGINATED FROM ANIMALS, STARTED AT A SEAFOOD MARKET IN WUHAN \n The virus was first detected at a seafood market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, which has been shut down by authorities following the outbreak. \n  \n The market offered exotic wildlife for sale, including live foxes, crocodiles, wolf puppies, giant salamanders, snakes, rats, peacocks, porcupines, camel meat and other game, AFP reported. \n Gao Fu, director of the Chinese centre for disease control and prevention, said authorities believe the virus likely came from \"wild animals at the seafood market\" though the exact source remains undetermined. \n Two studies from China indicated that bats are the likely origin, as the strain was found to be closely related to a strain that exists in the animal. \n \"Bats being the native host of the Wuhan CoV (coronavirus) would be the logical and convenient reasoning, though it remains likely there was intermediate host(s) in the transmission cascade from bats to humans,\" the researchers from several institutions in China wrote in a paper. \n Another study identified snakes as a possible intermediate host. \n HUMAN-TO-HUMAN TRANSMISSION, NOT AIRBORNE BUT SPREAD THROUGH WATER DROPLETS \n Animals have been determined as the source of the virus, but human-to-human transmission of the virus is \"affirmative\", top Chinese expert on infectious diseases Zhong Nanshan told state broadcaster CCTV. \n It has since been passed to people who have had no contact with the market where the virus first broke out. \n Doctor Nathalie MacDermott of King's College London told AFP that it seems likely that the virus is spread through droplets in the air from sneezing or coughing. \n There is currently no vaccine for the virus. \n RECOMMENDED PROTECTION \n Members of the public have been advised to take steps to prevent the spread of the virus. This includes wearing masks when experiencing respiratory symptoms such as coughing or sneezing, and observe good hygiene practices, like washing their hands frequently. \n They should also avoid places and close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness. \n Singapore\u2019s Ministry of Health has issued an advisory asking travellers to avoid contact with live animals and consuming raw and undercooked meat. \n Those who are feeling unwell should also seek prompt medical attention, it added. \n  \n CITIES LOCKED DOWN IN CHINA \n More than 800 people have been infected with the coronavirus in China, with at least 26 fatalities reported. \n  \n Most of the patients came from Wuhan, where the virus started. It has since spread to other major cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong. \n Transport in and out of Wuhan have ceased operations in an effort to prevent and control the spread of the virus. \n Authorities have also locked down several cities in Hubei province as a response to the outbreak. Entertainment venues such as Shanghai\u2019s Disneyland park, theatres and karaoke bars have also been closed down. \n Hubei province authorities also said they were calling off cultural performances and public cultural venues. Travel agencies in the province have suspended business and the government has announced that refunds would be given to those who cancel transport tickets. \n Beijing has also cancelled Chinese New Year holiday gatherings at temples. \n NINE COUNTRIES REPORT CASES,\u00a0INCLUDING SINGAPORE \n The first case of the virus reported outside of China was on Jan 13, when a Chinese woman was diagnosed with mild pneumonia after returning to Thailand from Wuhan. Another case was confirmed in Japan the next day. \n So far, there have been confirmed cases in nine countries outside of China. Thailand has the most reported cases, at four. \n Singapore reported its first case on Jan 23 \u2013 a 66-year-old Chinese man from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore on Jan 20 and stayed at Shangri-La\u2019s Rasa Sentosa Resort. \n  \n He reported symptoms such as a sore throat and fever and went to Singapore General Hospital, where he was diagnosed with pneumonia and identified as a suspect case. He was confirmed to have been infected by the virus on Jan 23. \n Contact tracing has been initiated to identify people who may have had close contact with the man. Two other cases have since been confirmed, one of which is the man\u2019s 37-year-old son. \n Border screening has been implemented in several countries, including Singapore, as a response to the outbreak. \n Budget carrier Scoot has cancelled its daily flight to Wuhan and schools across the island have asked parents to declare their travel plans for the Chinese New Year weekend. \n Follow us on Telegram for the latest updates: https://cna.asia/telegram"}, {"content": "With coronavirus genetic code in hand, scientists begin work on a vaccine.  When a newly organised vaccine research group at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) met for the first time this week, its members had expected to be able to ease into their work.

In a communication to the country, the WHO representative in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe did not specify what kind of help her organization can provide to the archipelago. Anne Ancie said that in Africa there is still no suspected case of coronavirus, but &quot;that does not prevent intense work from being carried out&quot; on the continent.

Last week, Italian Foreign Minister Luigi di Maio showed the arrival of a shipment of material to fight the new coronavirus sent by China. This week there was a new shipment to Italy, this time from Germany, shared by the health minister, but it received less attention. Recovering from draconian quarantines and accelerating production, China is now heading to Europe, the new epicenter of the pandemic, with a mix of aid and trade in products that serve to protect and treat people infected with the new coronavirus or sick com covid-19 - after having been much criticized by the initial crisis management. The country was already, before the pandemic, one of the main manufacturers of surgical masks and respiratory protection. \u201cChina&#39;s advantage in material aid is increased because much of what the world needs to fight the coronavirus is done in China,\u201d says an article in Foreign Affairs magazine Kurt M. Campbell, CEO of Asia Group. Washington), and Rush Doshi, director of the China Strategic Initiative at the Brookings Institution think tank (in the same city). \u201cNow, through wartime industrial mobilization, [Beijing] has increased production by more than tenfold, giving it the ability to make it available to the world,\u201d note the two authors. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang had agreed to send two million surgical masks, 200,000 respiratory protection masks and 500,000 tests to the European Union. Von der Leyen said the EU is increasing production but that it will take time to get the material ready. She also recalled that when China began to be hit, the European Union sent more than 50 tonnes of protective equipment. \u201cChina has not forgotten\u201d, and \u201ctoday we are at the center of the pandemic, and we are the ones who need this equipment.\u201d This support for the European Union adds to what China has already given not only to Italy but also to other countries, such as Spain or Belgium, and which has also included sending doctors. Not everything is donations, there are also sales (like the one agreed with the Hospital de S. Jo\u00e3o, in Porto, facilitated by local authorities), and not everything is done by the Government, the multimillionaire Jack Ma (from the online shopping platform Alibaba) donated a million masks and hundreds of thousands of test kits for the United States. Chinese President Xi Jinping told Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte that he hoped to create a \u201cHealth Silk Road,\u201d in reference to his New Silk Road project, which has been viewed with particular suspicion by some European countries , especially from the North. As for the head of the Spanish Government Pedro S\u00e1nchez, Xi said that \u201cafter the storm comes the calm\u201d, and that at this point the two should increase cooperation and trade. China&#39;s main strategy, writes Politico, is to show that \u201cthe country that was the origin of the virus is now on the front line of trying to save humanity, while the European Union fails to act and the other superpower of the world is occupied to point fingers\u201d. These are real relief efforts, experts point out, noting that they are not just altruistic and that political ends also deserve attention. &quot;There is nothing wrong with China helping European countries, and others, especially now that it has gained an advantage by containing the coronavirus,&quot; Noah Barkin of the German Marshall Fund think tank told British daily The Guardian. \u201cBut it&#39;s also clear that [Beijing] sees this aid as a propaganda tool.\u201d The biggest asset is aid to European countries and, notes the South China Morning Post, direct aid to the European Union makes a diplomatic difference in relation to actions with individual countries. Here, his attitude contrasts with the lesser solidarity of Europeans, especially towards Italy, the first and most affected. And even more, compared to the attitude of the United States, with the US President, Donald Trump, trying to buy the US exclusive rights to a vaccine to be developed in Germany (the US denied this attempt, the German Government confirmed), and to subject Schengen countries to a previous uncoordinated entry ban. \u201cWhile Trump hits Europe with a travel ban, China is the generous and selfless friend,\u201d says Barkin. He subscribes to newsletters for free and receive the best of current affairs and the most in-depth works from P\u00fablico. In the Foreign Affairs article, Campbell and Doshi point out that \u201cin the last seven decades, the US status as a global leader has been built not only on wealth and power but, just as important, on the legitimacy that comes with the way of governing. domestically, from the provision of global public goods, and from the will to coordinate, and achieve, a global crisis response\u201d. Now on the issue of the current pandemic, which tests all three aspects, \u201cWashington is, so far, failing\u201d. And on the other side, &quot;Beijing is moving quickly and skillfully, taking advantage of the opening created by US mistakes, to fill the void and position itself as the global leader in the response to the pandemic.&quot;"}, {"content": "Covid-19: G20 leaders meet on Thursday via videoconference to discuss action.

LONDON: Companies and tourists out of pocket from the global disruption caused by the virus epidemic in China risk meeting a cold shoulder from insurers, industry experts warn. \n Basic travel insurance policies are unlikely to cover epidemics. Instead, individuals are being advised initially to consult their credit card or travel providers to get refunded for cancelled bookings, and for medical costs. \n Leading British insurer Aviva said customers need to have specific coverage for \"travel disruption\" as part of their policy to be sure of reimbursement for changes to their plans. \n \"We're monitoring the situation closely, but so far the overwhelming majority of claims relate to customers who are travelling to and from China,\" an Aviva spokeswoman said. \n Allianz of Germany said the first port of call for individuals suffering disruption should be their airline or travel agency, rather than their insurer. \n The company said the outbreak was \"clearly a very urgent alert\" but at this stage, normal terms and conditions of insurance contracts applied. \n CORONAVIRUS A\u00a0\"KNOWN EVENT\" \n The General Insurance Association of Singapore (GIA) said that most insurers \"consider the 2019-nCoV a known event\", and have issued consumer advisories on travel insurance claims related to or arising from the event. \n Customers should\u00a0approach their insurers if they are in doubt about whether a claim is covered in their respective policies - this includes\u00a0travel cancellation, flight postponement\u00a0and trip curtailment arising from the coronavirus situation. \n They should also keep themselves updated on insurers' latest consumer advisories, GIA said. \n The eligibility of claims can be affected by a cut-off date for coverage, affected regions visited and reasons for travel disruption, it added. \n For companies such as airlines that are now ripping up their China plans, there may be no recourse from their insurers, according to Clarissa Franks, risk management placement leader at insurance broker Marsh in London. \n Communicable diseases will typically only be covered if airlines\u00a0have taken out specialist coverage. But that would come at a cost that probably outweighs the risk-benefit return, Franks\u00a0said. \n RIPPLE EFFECTS \n It is too early to determine overall costs to the insurance industry from the deadly coronavirus, experts said. \n The reinsurance market at Lloyd's of London has not seen any untoward activity from traditional insurers looking to hedge their exposure to risks arising from this outbreak, two sources in the underwriting trade said. \n But even if they are not covered for communicable diseases specifically, companies will be checking the fine print as ripple effects flow through their China operations and global supply chains, following Beijing's decision to quarantine entire cities. \n As with SARS and other pandemics of recent years such as swine flu, Zika and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the industry will be \"paying very close attention to this\", Association of British Insurers spokesman Malcolm Tarling said. \n He cautioned individuals and companies: \"If someone travels (to China) against government advice, then most policies will be invalidated. If you believe your trip is essential, you need to talk to your insurer first.\" \n  \n RISK CALCULUS \n The closest analogy is SARS, which first broke out in China in 2002 and led to a slew of disputes between companies and their insurance providers. \n For the travel industry alone, the impact of SARS was estimated by the World Travel and Tourism Council at US$30 billion to US$50 billion. \n But China's economy accounted for 5 per cent of the global gross domestic product then, compared to nearly a fifth today, according to World Bank data. \n More Chinese now travel abroad than any other nationality, and they spend the most on average while away. \n The number of infections from the new virus stands at more than 20,000, and the World Health Organization has declared a public health emergency. \n But health experts stress its mortality rate among patients is lower than for SARS. \n In a blog, Risk Management Solutions noted that several sporting and cultural events have already been cancelled in China, \"and all risk stakeholders will be anxious over the number of months before 2019-nCoV (the novel coronavirus) is contained\". \n Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"}, {"content": "British PM Boris Johnson calls PM Narendra Modi to discuss coronavirus crisis.

The World Health Organization (WHO) says that 675 million dollars (about 613 million euros) are needed to implement a global plan to fight viruses in the next three months, a press conference announced this Wednesday. WHO also revealed that experts will meet in Geneva (Switzerland) on 11 and 12 February to set priorities in drug research and development, diagnostics and vaccines. So far, there are nearly 25,000 people infected and nearly 500 deaths caused by this virus. For now, WHO has requested a $675 million fund to fight the virus in the world and in China between February and April. Of that, $60 million (about \u20ac54 million) will go to WHO operations and the rest to countries that are especially at risk. This is the Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan budget, which includes activities and resources for international organizations to combat the new coronavirus. The objective is to limit transmission between people, especially in the most vulnerable countries, as well as to identify, isolate and take care of patients early, or even minimize the economic and social impact. \u201cMy biggest concern is in countries that today do not have systems in place to detect people infected with the virus,\u201d said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. &quot;Urgent support is needed to strengthen health systems that detect, diagnose and protect further transmission between humans and health professionals.&quot; Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of WHO, also said that \u201cvery soon\u201d a WHO team will be going to China. &quot;The effectiveness of the outbreak response depends on preparedness measures,&quot; said Mike Ryan, director of WHO&#39;s emergency programme. &quot;This is why we are looking for resources to safeguard the most vulnerable countries.&quot; One of the big questions is also the advance in treatments for the new coronavirus. So far, there is no specific drug or vaccine against the virus. Due to some speculation about the development of new treatments, WHO was keen to stress this week that &quot;there are still no effective therapies against this 2019-nCoV&quot; and that several experts will meet this month to prioritize these advances. Even though there is no specific treatment, the Chinese government has suggested antiviral drugs used to treat HIV, namely lopinavir and ritonavir, and the inhalation of a dose of nebulized interferon-alpha twice a day. Gilead Sciences is also testing an antiviral therapy for the Ebola virus in patients infected with the new coronavirus. As for the vaccine, scientists in Australia have developed a laboratory-grown version of the virus, which could be an important step in developing a vaccine. Also, the Alliance for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) has already announced that three different research teams are developing vaccines and that the aim is for clinical trials to begin in June. Russian Health Minister Mikhail Murashko also said on Wednesday that scientists in Russia expected to take at least between eight and ten months to develop a vaccine for the virus. \u201cToday, the process of developing a vaccine does not take place in a short period of time. A vaccine is being developed in at least eight to ten months,\u201d he said, quoted by Russian news agency Interfax. Last week, Russia announced that it was working on a vaccine with China. Choosing a new name for this virus \u2013 temporarily designated 2019-nCoV by WHO \u2013 may seem somewhat minor. \u201cThe [official] name of the new virus is long overdue because the focus so far has been on the public health response,\u201d says Crystal Watson, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Safety (USA), quoted on the BBC website . However, there are some reasons why choosing the name becomes more of a priority. &quot;When we don&#39;t have an official name, there is a danger that people will start using terms like &#39;Chinese virus&#39; and that they might create a backlash against certain populations.&quot; The choice of name is up to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV, its acronym in English). In accordance with committee guidelines, the name should not include geographic locations, names of people, the name of an animal or type of food, or references to a culture or industry. This name should be short and descriptive, such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). An ICTV group is already deliberating on the new name. Official names can also become an issue. In fact, in 2015, WHO criticized the name MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) as it could provoke, for example, a negative reaction against members of religious and ethnic communities. There is still a lot to unravel about the virus, but one of the data that is thought to have already been acquired is what transmission can occur in the period before the onset of symptoms. Initially, one of the strongest evidence in favor of this hypothesis came from a Chinese woman who had had a meeting in Munich: she would have infected other people and would only have symptoms days later. This situation was published in The New England Journal of Medicine. However, the investigators had only relied on reports from German patients. The Robert Koch Institute, the German public health agency, and the Bavarian State Health and Food Safety Authority spoke with the Chinese patient and have now been informed that she still had symptoms during her stay in Germany. Despite this new information, other data support the hypothesis that asymptomatic transmission occurs. This Wednesday, the case of the youngest person infected with the new coronavirus was also announced. Chinese media reported that a baby was diagnosed with the virus just 30 hours after he was born, reports British newspaper The Guardian. According to Chinese state television CCTV, the virus had been detected in the baby&#39;s mother before delivery. This Wednesday, four more cases were also confirmed in Singapore, including a six-month-old baby. Still on the transmission of the virus, it was confirmed last week that a doctor who issued an alert about the coronavirus is also infected. The story of this ophthalmologist, Li Wenliang, began on December 30th when he wrote a message to his group of college friends. In that message, he mentioned that in his hospital there were seven patients with symptoms similar to those of SARS. He also asked his friends and their families to be careful. He subscribes to newsletters for free and receive the best of current affairs and the most in-depth works from P\u00fablico. As the message eventually went viral, police accused him of spreading rumors, which could land him in prison for seven years. According to the Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds, seven other doctors received the same warning. The doctor ended up having to sign a declaration in which he admitted his fault and promised not to do the same again. A few days later, he ended up getting infected by the new coronavirus, after having treated a patient. The new coronavirus has yet to reach Africa, but Africa&#39;s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has already activated its emergency operations center to tackle the virus and is organizing a workshop in Senegal for 15 African countries. An isolation ward is now ready at the hospital in Khartoum, Sudan. Laboratories in Senegal, Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, Madagascar or Sierra Leone already have the necessary equipment to detect the virus. Passengers arriving at airports from Cameroon or Gambia are being monitored for fever and other viral symptoms. The Democratic Republic of Congo has already prevented its citizens from traveling to China. Burkina Faso asked Chinese citizens to postpone their travels.

All the three patients from Kerala recently returned from the affected Wuhan city.\nIndia on Tuesday further tightened visa rules by cancelling the existing visas for Chinese and foreigners who had visited the country in the last two weeks.\nOn February 2, India temporarily suspended e-visa facility for Chinese travellers and foreigners residing in China in view of the outbreak.\nCurrently, 647 Indians and seven Maldivians, who have been evacuated from Wuhan and Hubei are in 14-day quarantine at a medical camp in Manesar, near Delhi.\nChinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told the media here that 16 foreigners in China have been infected with the virus.\nShe, however, declined to provide details of their nationalities in her Tuesday media briefing, citing privacy concerns.\nAccording to reports, those infected included four Pakistanis and two Australians.\nWuhan has thousands of foreigners as it is an education hub.\nHundreds of Pakistani have been pleading to their government to evacuate them citing successful evacuation by the Indian government.\nChina has struggled to contain the virus despite implementing unprecedented measures, including virtually locking down more than 50 million people in Hubei.\nWhile the virus cases increased by the hour, Chinese health officials attributed the spiralling rate of cases and the death toll to shortages of hospitals mainly in Hubei and its provincial capital Wuhan.\nAlso Chinese officials have converted the national auditorium and gymnasium in Wuhan into a hospital to exclusively treat growing number of coronavirus cases.\nMeanwhile, the World Health Organisation said on Tuesday that the outbreak of the deadly virus does not yet constitute a \"pandemic\".\nIn its report on Tuesday, they WHO said dramatic measures taken by China to rein in the virus has prevented significant spread abroad.\nThe UN health agency's chief also called for greater global solidarity, accusing some governments of wealthy countries of being \"well behind\" in sharing data on virus cases.\n\"While 99 percent of cases are in China, in the rest of the world we only have 176 cases,\" the UN health agency's chiefs aid in a technical briefing to the WHO's Executive Board in Geneva.\nEarlier, the WHO categorised the coronavirus as Public Health Emergency of International Concern."}, {"content": "covid-19: connection between s\u2019pore church clusters found, after new testing method identifies couple as missing link. SINGAPORE \u2014 A link between two Covid-19 church clusters, where the source of infection had previously eluded the authorities, was finally established. This was done through a serological test, a new testing method developed by Duke-NUS Medical School.\u00a0 \n The test is able to detect past infections in someone\u00a0who has recovered from it. Individuals\u00a0who had contracted\u00a0the coronovirus before will have high levels of virus-specific antibodies in their blood which can be picked up by this test.\u00a0\u00a0 \n The authorities ran\u00a0this test on Case 83, a 54 year-old Singaporean man,\u00a0and Case 91, a 58-year-old Singaporean woman and the latest case to be announced on Tuesday (Feb 25). They then discovered that both of them\u00a0had earlier contracted Covid-19 but were\u00a0not detected at the time. \n They also found\u00a0that the two, who are married,\u00a0had a link with\u00a0another married couple from Wuhan (Cases 8 and 9) who had visited Life Church and Missions Singapore. Both couples were there on the same day on Jan 19. \n Case 91, the wife,\u00a0developed symptoms on Jan 23 and Case 83, the husband, had symptoms on Jan 28. \n On Jan 25, both of them\u00a0attended a Chinese New Year gathering on Mei Hwan Drive near Ang Mo Kio Ave 1 which other confirmed cases attended, including Case 66, a 28-year-old Singaporean man who worked at Grace Assembly of God church.\u00a0 \n On Feb 1, 6\u00a0and 10, the wife\u00a0sought treatment at a general practitioner (GP) clinic. \n At the same time, records also showed that her husband\u00a0had gone to see a GP\u00a0repeatedly on Feb 1, 5, 6 and 10.\u00a0 \n During the period under investigations later, the couple\u00a0were not sick\u00a0and did not show symptoms, but records by the Ministry of Health (MOH) showed that the wife\u00a0had gone to the emergency department of Sengkang General Hospital earlier on Jan 26 with symptoms consistent with Covid-19.\u00a0 \n She was not marked\u00a0as a suspect case at the time\u00a0because she had no recent travel history to China. The case definition has since been expanded to include those who have not been to\u00a0China in the last 14 days. \n On Feb 18, both of them showed up\u00a0at\u00a0the National Centre for Infectious Diseases\u00a0to undergo tests, including the\u00a0serological tests. It\u00a0was then confirmed that they had earlier been infected with the virus. On Feb 19, results showed that the husband had\u00a0Covid-19\u00a0while results for the wife were\u00a0confirmed\u00a0on Feb 22. \n Together with help from the police doing contact tracing, the authorities\u00a0found that the Chinese New Year gathering on\u00a0Mei Hwan Drive was the common event that this Singaporean couple\u00a0attended together with Case 66\u00a0from the Grace Assembly of God church. \n  Illustration: Samuel Woo/TODAY \n As of Tuesday, there are\u00a023\u00a0cases from the Grace Assembly of God cluster \u2014 making it the biggest cluster \u2014 and seven cases from\u00a0Life Church and Missions Singapore in Paya Lebar.\u00a0 \n Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, director of medical services at MOH, said that the serological tests gave the authorities the confidence to establish that the cases reported at the Grace Assembly of God cluster was not a case of widespread community transmission from other sources. \n Rather, it was a result of a sequential series of events, he\u00a0said at a media briefing on Tuesday by the multi-ministry task force\u00a0managing the public health crisis. \n MOH said that the spread between the clusters started with Case\u00a08 (a 56 year-old woman) and Case 9 (a 56 year-old man), who are Chinese nationals.\u00a0 \n The couple arrived in Singapore on Jan 19 from Wuhan, China \u2014 the epicentre of the outbreak.\u00a0\u00a0 \n They likely infected the Singaporean couple who\u00a0went on to pass the infection to Case 66 at the Chinese New Year gathering, the ministry said. Case 66 later\u00a0passed the infection to his colleagues at Grace Assembly of God church. \n Case 66\u00a0was thus found to be the primary case in the Grace Assembly of God\u00a0cluster.\u00a0 \n Some people were exposed to him\u00a0at a staff meeting at the Tanglin branch of the church and they in turn infected other church members, MOH said.\u00a0 \n Writing on Facebook, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that the authorities \u201cdiscovered an important link\u201d between two existing clusters, including the biggest cluster at Grace Assembly of God.\u00a0 \n He noted that Cases\u00a083 and 91 had only mild symptoms earlier\u00a0and had not been diagnosed with Covid-19. But the new serological test later\u00a0confirmed that they had been infected earlier, and linked the two clusters together.\u00a0 \n \u201cThis breakthrough would not have been possible without close cooperation among the Ministry of Health, Singapore Police Force and researchers from Duke-NUS Medical School, who developed the serological test, the world's first, here in Singapore. My thanks to all of you for a job well done!\u201d he added.\u00a0"}, {"content": "big read: 17 years on, s\u2019pore puts sars lessons to test in fight against wuhan coronavirus. SINGAPORE \u2014 Like many others on the frontline during the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) pandemic in 2003, the resources of a family clinic in Chua\u00a0Chu Kang had been stretched thin. \n Personal protective equipment \u2014 N95 respirators, sterile gloves and full-body gowns \u2014 was scarce at a time when the world had never seen a virus like it, and people everywhere were desperately scrambling to stockpile emergency supplies for themselves.\u00a0 \n Speaking to TODAY, Dr Tan Tze Lee, a general practitioner at the Edinburgh Clinic, recalled the difficulties that frontline healthcare workers faced when procuring equipment to protect themselves from the killer virus.\u00a0 \n By the time Sars was contained in May 2003, it had infected 238 people and killed 33 in Singapore. Two in five of those infected had been healthcare workers. \n While Dr Tan\u2019s clinic thankfully encountered no cases, it remained on high alert for Sars patients in the four months of the epidemic in Singapore, throughout which the medical staff had to don full protective gear. But everyone was not ready for the crisis, said Dr Tan, who is also president of the College of Family Physicians Singapore.\u00a0 \n Many continued to work but were extremely concerned that they might bring the virus home and put their loved ones at risk, he added.\u00a0 \n \u201cThe healthcare practitioners in Singapore were ill-prepared, which resulted in sombre outcomes. Since then, we have learnt our lesson and measures were instituted to prepare us for any future pandemic event.\u201d \n \u201cHere we are today, ready to fight the 2019-nCoV,\u201d he said. \n The current outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus \u2014 or 2019-nCoV, the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) temporary name for the virus \u2014 was first confirmed in Singapore on Jan 23. To date, all cases were imported, including a Singaporean who was in Wuhan, and there has been no evidence of community spread in the Republic.\u00a0 \n The WHO has yet to declare the virus \u2014 which has spread to several countries \u2014 as a pandemic. Nevertheless, it was declared a global health emergency on Friday (Jan 31).\u00a0 \n The first cases were reported in Wuhan in China\u2019s Hubei province and believed to be linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which sells live animals.\u00a0 \n As of noon on Friday, there were 16 confirmed cases with the virus here, 35 cases were still waiting for their test results and 198 had already tested negative.\u00a0There are no deaths in Singapore thus far. \n At the heart of the city-state\u2019s response plan is the Disease Outbreak Response System (Dors), a crisis management plan which did not exist in 2003, but was drafted after Sars and refined again in the wake of the swine flu (or H1N1) pandemic in 2009.\u00a0 \n  Medical workers conduct routine checks to guests\u00a0before the start of an NKF show at a Mediacorp studio as a safety precaution against SARS in 2003. TODAY file photo \n \u201cAfter Sars, we made a thorough review of the facilities we had \u2013 the infrastructure, hospitals, isolation wards, and the scientific testing and capabilities,\u201d said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week.\u00a0 \n \u201cI think we are much better prepared now.\u201d\u00a0 \n Currently, Singapore is at Dors condition (Dorscon) Yellow, signifying that the virus is severe and can infect from person to person, but is chiefly occurring outside Singapore. The next step up is Dorscon Orange, which would have applied in the case of Sars, whereby the virus is spreading in Singapore but not widely, and is being contained. \n While the plans are in place and some measures have kicked in, Singapore\u2019s national strategy is still largely untested \u2014 since the Wuhan coronavirus is believed to be in its early stages in the Republic, medical experts and Sars veterans told TODAY.\u00a0 \n However, there are ample signs that the lessons from Sars are being applied as Singapore shores up its defences, they said. They believe that unlike during\u00a0Sars, Singapore is far more ready now. \n LESSONS LEARNT \n Singapore has had two brushes with pandemics in recent memory \u2014 Sars and H1N1. \n While Singapore was able to contain and recover from both, the varying nature of the viruses, as well as the changes in medical science, meant that dealing with each required different approaches. \n Doctors had limited options when treating Sars patients and could only administer supportive care, and there was nothing that could be done to prevent infection. In comparison, vaccines and treatment options were available when H1N1 claimed 18 lives in Singapore and infected more than 400,000 people, out of which about 1,300 had to be hospitalised. \n Sars first arrived in Singapore in late February 2003, and was detected in\u00a0a woman with an atypical pneumonia on March 1, 2003 at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH). At the time, no one knew how deadly and virulent it was and the first patient led to a cluster of 42 cases at the hospital.\u00a0 \n A Ministry of Health (MOH) taskforce was set up on March 15, two weeks after the mysterious strain appeared in Singapore and three days after the WHO issued a global alert on the outbreak that began in Hong Kong. \n But the command and control structure then was \u201cwholly inadequate\u201d in a crisis situation that was both fluid and unprecedented, a study in the Austrian Journal of South-east Asian Studies concluded in 2012. \n  Church goers being screened for their body temperature by the thermal imaging system at\u00a0New Creation Church before attending prayers in 2003. TODAY file photo \n   Authorities conducting temperature screening at Tuas checkpoint on Jan 24, 2020. Photos: Najeer Yusof/TODAY \n The structure was led by the health authorities, when in hindsight, it required \u201cmore than a medical approach since resources had to be drawn from a number of government agencies that did not fall under the rubric of the MOH\u201d, said authors Allen Lai and Tan Teck Boon, who were from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. \n They noted that it took five weeks after the first case was reported for the bureaucracy to adapt, though by then, the outbreak had already spread quickly out of TTSH.\u00a0 \n On April 7, 2003, a national control structure was created in response to Sars, comprising a nine-member inter-ministerial committee led by then Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng to provide strategic and political directions during health crises. \n Helping to coordinate across silos were a core executive group of senior civil servants, and an operations committee spanning ministries. Their functions were later consolidated during the H1N1 crisis, which meant that this leaner bureaucracy was quicker to respond to emerging situations on the ground. \n With the Wuhan coronavirus, observers told TODAY that it was evident that the Government had reacted more quickly than in Sars and H1N1 when it came to establishing a multi-disciplinary decision-making body.\u00a0 \n Professor Ooi Eng Eong, an infectious diseases expert and virologist at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, noted that a multi-ministry taskforce on the Wuhan coronavirus was formed on Jan 22, several hours before the first suspected case came to the attention of the authorities at 10pm the same day. The patient \u2014 a 66-year-old Chinese national tourist from Wuhan \u2014 tested positive the next day, becoming the first confirmed case in Singapore. \n \u201cIf you look at the response time, it is a fact that the ministerial committee formed before the case appeared, and we can see that a lot of systems are\u00a0already in place, occurring across ministries and not as siloed as back then when Sars caught us all by surprise,\u201d said Prof Ooi, who is also deputy director of the Emerging Infectious Diseases Programme at Duke-NUS Medical School. \n The taskforce was formed to direct the whole-of-government response to the outbreak, coordinate the public\u2019s response and work with the international community. \n Jointly chaired by Health Minister Gan Kim Yong and National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, the taskforce comprises a cross-section of Cabinet ministers spanning various portfolios. They are: \n Adviser: Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat \n Mr S Iswaran, Minister for Communications and Information \n Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Trade and Industry \n Mr Masagos Zulkifli, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources \n Mr Ng Chee Meng, Secretary-General of the National Trades Union Congress \n Mr Ong Ye Kung, Minister for Education \n Mrs Josephine Teo, Minister for Manpower and Second Minister for Home Affairs \n Mr Desmond Lee, Minister for Social and Family Development \n Dr Janil Puthucheary, Senior Minister of State for Transport, Communications and Information \n Dr Chia Shi-Lu, a Tanjong Pagar GRC Member of Parliament who chairs the Government Parliamentary Committee for Health, said that this time, the chain of command is clearer. \n He noted that even before the taskforce was formed, the MOH had already begun tracking the outbreak in China at the start of the year. Temperature screening measures were put in place at Changi Airport from as early as Jan 3. \n But the high political signature of the panel had led some to question whether too many cooks were spoiling the broth, Dr Chia noted. \u201cIn fact, some have asked me: Are we overdoing it?\u201d he said.\u00a0 \n \u201cI believe it is very important for everybody to come into the picture \u2014 you have to, because at this early stage, (the outbreak) affects so many different parts and you need leadership from them, and you cannot rely solely on MOH to coordinate everything,\u201d he added. \n While information about the Wuhan virus is still emerging, Singapore\u00a0is not in the same position as in the initial stages of the Sars outbreak in 2003, where it was \u2014 in the words of then Health Minister Lim Hng Kiang \u2014\u201cflying blind\u201d.\u00a0 \n During the Sars crisis, Singapore only had two means to detect those infected with the virus: Their clinical symptoms and their travel history. Detecting these were not easy at the time as temperature screeners were also a rare resource, unlike today. \n \u201cWe have to depend on people taking temperature, and we have to depend on people being truthful to us in their contact history,\u201d said Mr Lim then, describing Sars as a tremendous challenge. \n Dr Tan Yia Swam, First Vice-President of the Singapore Medical Association (SMA), said that in the Sars crisis, \u201cthere were too many unknowns, and precautions came too late, and too slowly\u201d. Sars was zoonotic in nature, with the disease starting in animals before spreading to humans.\u00a0 \n As a result, policies and procedures regarding risk stratification, contact mapping, contact tracing, quarantine and others were developed on the fly as the epidemic erupted, she said. \n \u201cToday, all of the above have been developed and tested before in exercises and they are now put into action. Of course, these plans, policies and procedures must be modified in line with the epidemiology of the disease, but we are not working from scratch, unlike the past experience with Sars,\u201d she added.\u00a0 \n  Tan Tock Seng Hospital's\u00a0moderate risk area during the 2003 Sars period. TODAY file photo \n   Notices at Tan Tock Seng Hospital informing visitors and patients of the Wuhan coronavirus. Photos: Raj Nadarajan/TODAY \n Addressing the media on Monday, Mr Lawrence Wong said that in the taskforce\u2019s national response to the virus, it is able to \u201cmarshal all available resources\u201d to tackle the scourge. \n In terms of capacity, Singapore has already beefed up its healthcare and isolation capacity since 2003. This includes the 330-bed National Centre for Infectious Diseases that opened last year, and new hospitals such as Khoo Teck Puat Hospital in 2010, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital in 2015, and Sengkang General Hospital in 2018, he said. \n During Sars, TTSH was known as \u201cSars Central\u201d, the designated hospital to handle patients. This was borne out of a policy to restrict transmission of the virus to other hospitals, after a patient \u2014 who was unaware that he had been infected with the virus during his stay in TTSH \u2014 created a new viral cluster at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) when he went there for a surgical problem after his discharge from TTSH.\u00a0 \n This policy changed in 2009 during the H1N1 outbreak, with the Health Ministry imposing a standardised infection control measure on all healthcare facilities, empowered by timely tweaks to the Infectious Diseases Act. More than 400 family clinics were made \u201cH1N1-ready\u201d and equipped with the Tamiflu vaccine to handle the outbreak. \n Similarly, all public hospitals are capable of handling the Wuhan virus today, and come equipped with isolation rooms, which were in short supply in 2003.\u00a0 \n When it came to medical supplies, Dr Chia recalled how there was hardly a stockpile of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers then, such as N95 respirators. \n \u201cBecause an N95 mask needs to fit well for it to perform its function, having a properly fitted mask was (hard to come by) during Sars, and we had to find time to do the fitting too,\u201d said Dr Chia, who was an orthopaedic surgeon at SGH at the height of the crisis.\u00a0 \n \u201cToday, most of us are already fitted with our own personal equipment, even as new staff. Everything is in place today,\u201d he said. \n Visitors, staff and patients entering Gleneagles Hospital will have to undergo a screening at the entrance. Photo: Justin Ong/TODAY \n For the general public, the Government will be disbursing a pack of four surgical masks\u00a0to each of the 1.37 million Singapore households in a one-off exercise between Feb 1 and Feb 9. This was also done in 2003 when all households received a free emergency kit, containing N95 masks and themometers. \n This time round, the mask distribution comes amid long queues at pharmacies around the island as people clamour to buy masks, and retailers say their stocks of surgical masks and N95 masks are running low or sold out. The Government had released 5 million masks from its stockpile over nine days to the retailers but they were all snapped up in hours.\u00a0 \n Said Dr Chia: \u201cThe message is that there is enough for the whole of the population and in reserve too.\u201d \n SMA\u2019s Dr Tan said his association met with the College of Family Physicians Singapore over the Chinese New Year weekend to carry out \u201ccomplex logistics arrangements\u201d to ensure that there is a steady supply of surgical and N95 masks to replenish stocks for the frontline healthcare workers. \n \u201cWe are all monitoring the situation closely, and are ready to step up efforts when the need arises,\u201d he said. \n Experts noted that contingency plans have been put in place too \u2014 student hostels are converted into quarantine facilities in anticipation of future cases, and the Outward Bound Singapore on Pulau Ubin has been marked as a possible quarantine site. \n  Nanyang Technological University's Graduate Hall 1, which is designated as a quarantine facility. Photo: Raj Nadarajan/TODAY \n TRICKY BALANCE IN THE FACE OF IMPONDERABLES \n On Monday, Mr Lawrence Wong also called on Singaporeans to be psychologically prepared that the Wuhan virus could be worse than Sars given the many \u201cimponderables\u201d and \u201cuncertainties\u201d regarding the infection, though he stressed that there is still no evidence of community spread of the disease in Singapore. \n Over the past week, however, the first reports of human-to-human transmissions outside of China have surfaced in Taiwan, Japan, Vietnam and Germany. \n Mr Lawrence Wong said Singapore\u2019s approach \u201cis to anticipate and move as swiftly as we can\u201d. \u201cBut every action we take really has to be based on evidence, data and international medical guidelines,\u201d he added.\u00a0 \n Unlike Sars, which impacted Singapore when little was known about it, there is now a greater understanding about the coronavirus, a family of viruses that include the Wuhan strain and Sars. \n But data gaps still exist, said Professor Tikki Elka Pangestu, a visiting fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and a former director of the WHO\u2019s research policy and cooperation department in Geneva.\u00a0 \n Prof Pangestu told TODAY that not much is known of the proportion of mild and asymptomatic cases versus the severe and fatal ones, which currently makes it difficult to evaluate the Wuhan virus\u2019 true epidemic potential and complicates the outbreak response. \n There is also the worry that the virus could mutate into a more virulent and more highly transmissible strain. \u201cThis needs close monitoring and another data gap will be in how quickly this development can be evaluated,\u201d he said. \n Despite these gaps, Singapore has \u201creacted much more swiftly and comprehensively\u201d than in 2003, Prof Pangestu added. \n  With the evolving Wuhan coronavirus situation, people are taking precautions to prevent the spreading of germs by wearing masks. Photo: Najeer Yusof/TODAY \n A rule of thumb for any country\u2019s approach in health crises, he said, is to base decisions on scientific evidence and rational analysis in the context of its own capacities.\u00a0 \n \u201cI think the Singapore approach is the correct one given the current information and evidence available \u2014 robust but not over-reactive and flexible enough to accommodate new developments,\u201d said Prof Pangestu.\u00a0 \n He noted that overreaction risks imposing an unjustifiable burden on the country, potentially impacting normal daily routines and the livelihoods of certain vulnerable segments of the population. Underreaction, on the other hand, would lead to a more extensive spread of the virus. \n \u201cCalibrating the balance is tricky, but as I said, base your decisions on the existing scientific evidence,\u201d said Prof Pangestu. \n Prof Ooi from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health added: \u201cThere is a risk and cost to overreaction and a cost to underreaction. Nobody knows what is the right answer and there is no hard science to it \u2014 this is a judgement call and there is no right or wrong.\u201d \n Where there is a dearth of knowledge on imported pandemic cases, Singapore\u2019s national strategy is flexible with the changing circumstances, and the plan recommends taking border control measures that would \u201cerr on the side of caution with more intense efforts until such time when the disease profile becomes clearer\u201d.\u00a0 \n Addressing the media on Friday, Mr Lee said: \u201cI think as a Government, in a way, we are overreacting\u00a0because we are trying to look ahead to see what can go wrong and take preemptive steps to prevent that from happening.\u201d \n Within a week, the taskforce moved from allowing travellers from Wuhan to enter Singapore while subject to enhanced screening on Monday, to imposing a complete entry ban on all nationalities who have been to China in the past 14 days on Friday. \n The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority has also stopped issuing all forms of new visas to those with People\u2019s Republic of China passports. \n HANDLING A PSYCHOLOGICAL CRISIS\u00a0 \n Although the memory of Sars may have faded for some, experts say that the psychological lessons from it have remained until today, such that more Singaporeans are aware of the need to cooperate with the authorities during a health crisis.\u00a0 \n For example, social media is rife with examples of Singaporeans calling out bad actors, such as online sellers who hoard surgical masks to resell, or profiteering behaviour by certain businesses. The Government has also acted quickly to combat such behaviour. \u00a0 But Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, believes that the Sars legacy can also be a double-edged sword: The prospect of another Sars-like epidemic might lead to needless panic, or worse, \u201ckiasuism\u201d.\u00a0 \n  Surgical masks sold out at Guardian Pharmacy at Changi Airport on Jan 29, 2020.\u00a0Photo: Nuria Ling/TODAY \n In a viral outbreak, being\u00a0 \u201ckiasu\u201d means that people only think for themselves, preventing mutual cooperation from happening, he said. \n Urging Singaporeans to do better, Dr Leong said they should be prepared for the viral outbreak but not overdo it. If fear and panic take hold, they can overwhelm the country\u2019s response \u201clike a tsunami\u201d, he said.\u00a0 \n This means Singapore\u2019s national response has to preemptively address concerns that could lead to panic, he said. \n \u201cYou have no time to get ready. Better to be ready (for the worst) now than not ready at all\u2026 There is little room for mistakes (that create more panic),\u201d said Dr Leong. \n Dr Chia believes that Singaporeans are generally behaving in a rational way so far, based on his conversations with residents as an MP or his interactions with patients. \n \u201cDuring Sars, there was a lot more fear and a sense of real danger for everyone. We had people trying to evade quarantine, refusing to cooperate or going for medical screening\u2026 But so far there are no cases of people who are trying to evade authorities, in other countries, yes, but not among Singaporeans,\u201d he said. \n The rise of social media, which was non-existent during Sars, can also give rise to disinformation that fuels further panic. \n On the threat of fake news, SMA\u2019s Dr Tan said: \u201cSocial media may do more harm than good in this kind of situation where fake news may spread faster than a virus and trigger unwanted behaviours. We urge all readers to exercise judgement when reading stories from various sources, and to keep referencing to official websites for accurate information.\u201d \n STRONGER LEGISLATION\u00a0 \n Compared with the Sars crisis, Singapore has more legislative levers now to deal with fake news and anti-social behaviour \u2014 the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act being one of them. \n Lesser known are the many enhancements to the Infectious Diseases Act over the years since 2003, which give the authorities greater powers to enforce orders that were issued in the fight against a gazetted outbreak. \n The Act allows people who break home quarantine orders to be arrested without a warrant and to be jailed or fined on conviction. It was amended last year to allow officers to use \u201cphysical means\u201d to enforce the order by bringing an absconder back to the place of isolation, in lieu of arrest. \n It also makes explicit that persons under legal orders that restrict their movement in Singapore, would not be allowed to leave the country, unless otherwise permitted. \n The breadth of such powers in Singapore gives the authorities the ability to ensure that evasion tactics, such as those described by Dr Chia, cannot happen again. The issue became such a problem during the Sars crisis that the health authorities had to resort to draconian measures, such as installing video surveillance cameras in the homes of people who were ordered to be quarantined.\u00a0 \n The lack of legal powers has created some difficulties for several foreign governments in dealing with the Wuhan coronavirus. Earlier this week, two Japanese citizens who were brought back to Japan from Wuhan on a chartered flight declined to go for medical screening when they landed in Tokyo. \n Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told the Japanese Parliament: \"While quarantine officers did their best to persuade them to go for further tests, they refused, and unfortunately there is no legal basis to force them to do so.\" \n MORAL SUASION AND IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC COMMS\u00a0 \n But over the longer term, evidence suggests that government measures such as quarantine and travel restrictions are not as effective as instilling a voluntary sense of social etiquette and responsibility among the people. \n Having a buy-in from the public is especially essential when the authorities need the people\u2019s support to carry out certain measures, noted Prof Pangestu. \n  \u200bPreschool children getting their health checked by teachers at My First Skool at Buangkok Crescent on Jan 28, 2020.\u00a0Photo: Nuria Ling/TODAY \n Prof Pangestu said: \u201cYou need the public\u2019s cooperation for your measures to be successful, such as to follow good hygiene practices, be alert to any symptoms, promptly seeking healthcare, awareness of potential risks, and to counter the spread of misinformation on social media.\u201d\u00a0 \n This will be critical during the \u201csurge response\u201d\u2014 when situational changes cause a sudden need for the authorities to ramp up its measures, such as activating quarantine sites that are being held in reserve. \n A lack of moral suasion would erase the ability for the Government to implement these measures, experts said. They noted how in Hong Kong, protestors bombed a general hospital and a residential building that the authorities had wanted to use as a possible quarantine facility. \n Over the past week, South Korean protesters \u2014 mostly residents \u2014 also used tractors to block access to facilities earmarked as quarantine centres in the cities of Asan and Jincheon, which are about 80km from Seoul. \n Experts said cooperation from the masses largely relies on public education as well as proper and accurate communication of risk, which is not always a guarantee considering the complex flow of information in a crisis situation that can lead to miscommunication.\u00a0 \n An April 2003 article in The Straits Times,\u00a0\"All the right moves for Sars but info\u2019s a bit slow, no?\",\u00a0by its then\u00a0news editor Bertha Henson, described how the MOH was asked at a press conference to confirm a tipoff that SGH nurses might have Sars. The authorities said no, but it later emerged the next day that 21 SGH staff were on the Sars suspect list. \n \u201cThe kindest thing I can say about this sudden announcement is that the ministry gets its information later than the media,\u201d wrote Ms Henson then. \n Referring to the incident, Professor Chee Yam Cheng, the current president of the Singapore Medical Council, wrote in a series of memos about Sars in 2003 that \u201cquick dissemination of information \u2014 and accurate information \u2014 is almost as important as transparency in a health emergency\u201d. \n Prof Pangestu believes that in general, Singaporeans are united and support what the Government is trying to do to contain the situation. \n \u201cBut public reaction is hard to control especially with fake news on social media. The idea that \u2018perception is reality, anything is the truth\u2019 often operates in this kind of (crisis) environment. That is why public risk communication is so important,\u201d he said."}, {"content": "Covid-19. Brussels supports repatriation of EU citizens on cruises in Japan. The European Commission announced this Wednesday that it will co-finance the repatriation of European Union (EU) citizens who were on board the cruise ship Diamond Princess, docked in Yokohama, Japan , via planes leaving Italy. After a two-week quarantine due to the new coronavirus (Covid-19), these European passengers will be repatriated on Italian planes, the first aircraft having already flown to Japan and the second will depart this evening, the community executive said in communicated. It will be up to the Italian medical team, on board each of these flights, to assess passengers on site and &quot;only those who have been reported as negative cases of Covid-19 or who do not show symptoms of the disease will be able to embark&quot; in these repatriation operations, he explains. Brussels. &quot;Upon arrival in Europe, passengers will start a new quarantine period organized and monitored by each Member State&quot;, adds the community executive, adding that the official numbers and nationalities of these passengers will only be &quot;known in the next few days&quot;. This support provided by Brussels follows on from the activation of the European Civil Protection Mechanism, and the European Commission is expected to co-finance the costs of these repatriation operations. So far, under this mechanism, Brussels has already supported the repatriation of 400 EU citizens to China, on planes organized by France and Germany. Cited by the note, European Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenarcic, points out that &quot;the EU continues to work 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to support both Member States and China&quot;. &quot;Currently, we are still working to ship supplies to China in the next few days,&quot; said the official. About 500 passengers left the cruise ship Diamond Princess, which is docked in Yokohama, Japan, this Wednesday after a two-week quarantine due to the new coronavirus (Covid-19). The quarantine, much criticized by passengers confined on the ship, failed to prevent the contagion of more than 600 people on board. The quarantine&#39;s failure was underscored when authorities today announced another 79 cases of infection by the new coronavirus, Convid-19, bringing the total on the ship to 621. People testing positive for the new coronavirus are being taken to medical centers to receive treatment. Japanese authorities are expected to spend the next three days conducting the disembarkation of around 2,000 passengers.

PARIS/WASHINGTON - Business activity collapsed from Australia, Japan and Western Europe to the United States at a record pace in March as measures to contain the coronavirus pandemic hammer the world economy, cementing economists' views of a deep global recession.  \n The highly contagious coronavirus, which causes a respiratory illness called COVID-19, has caused entire regions to be placed on lockdown and in some places soldiers are patrolling the streets to keep consumers and workers indoors, halting services and production and breaking supply chains.  \n \"The global health crisis is rapidly morphing into a global recession, as there is a clear tension between preventing infections and ruining the economy,\" said Edoardo Campanella, an economist at UniCredit Bank in Milan. \"However, a wise policy coordination between health and fiscal authorities should allow a V-shaped recovery once containment measures are relaxed.\"  \n Data firm IHS Markit said on Tuesday its flash U.S. Composite Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, dropped to a reading of 40.5 this month. That was an all-time low and followed a reading of 49.6 in February.  \n Last month's decline in the index, which is seen as a good measure of economic health, was the largest in the series' history. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in business activity. The survey underscored the rapidly deteriorating economy, highlighted last week by a government report showing the biggest rise since 2012 in the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits during the week ended March 14.  \n Economists are predicting claims will accelerate to a record 1.5 million or more when data for last week is published on Thursday.  \n The message was equally grim from the 19 countries that use the euro. IHS Markit's flash composite PMI for the euro zone plummeted to a record low of 31.4 in March.  \n That was by far the biggest one-month fall since the survey began in mid-1998 and below all forecasts in a Reuters poll which gave a median prediction of 38.8.  \n In France, services activity fell to a record low and manufacturing saw its steepest drop since the global financial crisis more than a decade ago.  \n A PMI for the services sector in Germany, Europe's largest economy, showed a record contraction in activity, while sister surveys showed Britain's economy shrinking at a record pace.  \n IHS Markit said the March figures suggested the euro zone economy was shrinking at a quarterly rate of around 2%, and the escalation of measures to contain the virus could steepen the downturn.  \n With most asset markets tanking, global central banks have been rolling out extraordinary measures on an almost daily basis to stop the rot. But some analysts say infinite monetary policy easing may not be enough and fiscal steps are crucial.  \n There was some optimism on that front, with senior Democrats and Republicans saying on Tuesday they were close to reaching a deal on a $2 trillion stimulus package to aid the U.S. economy.  \n Hopes for a large fiscal stimulus sparked a sharp rebound in global stock markets, with the Dow Jones <.DJI> raking up its biggest one-day percentage gain since 1933.

Given rising infections and death toll, health experts, economists and politicians have cautioned against such a move, which they say could backfire, with Americans remaining fearful of going out.  \n Trump and Vice President Mike Pence held a conference call with major Wall Street investors on Tuesday.  \n \"Sending the public back to work at this time would be premature,\" said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM in New York. \"The U.S. is better off taking a one-time hit to economic growth, as efforts to terminate the virus continue, rather than run the risk of multiple economic shutdowns.\" (Graphic: U.S. stocks have fallen hard - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3867/3828/Pasted%20Image.jpg)  \n Mirroring the emptying of supermarket shelves around the world, indebted corporates have rushed into money markets to hoard dollars, with a global shortage of dollar funding threatening to cripple firms from airlines to retailers.  \n PMI surveys from Japan showed the services sector shrinking at its fastest pace on record this month and factory activity contracting at its quickest in a decade.  \n This was consistent with a 4% contraction in 2020, Capital Economics senior economist Marcel Theliant said. The postponement of the Tokyo Olympics is expected to deal a heavy blow to the world's third-largest economy.  \n The U.S. Federal Reserve on Monday promised bottomless dollar funding and an array of programs to help keep companies afloat. For the first time, the Fed will back purchases of corporate bonds, backstop direct loans to companies and \"soon\" will roll out a programme to get credit to small and medium-sized businesses. It will also expand its asset purchases by \"as much as needed.\"  \n The Fed last week slashed borrowing costs to zero and took other emergency steps to keep the commercial paper, U.S. Treasury debt and foreign dollar funding markets functional.  \n G7 finance ministers and central bank governors on Tuesday pledged to expand fiscal and monetary actions for as long as necessary to restore growth and confidence.  \n With the International Monetary Fund predicting a global recession, the world's 20 largest economies agreed on Monday to develop an \"action plan,\" but without specifics.

SINGAPORE \u2014 The move to impose travel restrictions from coronavirus-hit China could have impacted bilateral relations, which was why Singapore made a \u201cspecial effort\" to explain why this measure was necessary, Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said in Parliament on Monday (March 2). \n Singapore had given Chinese officials a \u201cheads-up\u201d before its public announcement on Jan 31, which had barred any new visitors of any nationality with recent travel history to mainland China from entering the city-state, said Dr Balakrishnan in the debate on his ministry\u2019s budget. \n He was addressing questions from Mr Vikram Nair, Member of Parliament (MP) for\u00a0Sembawang Group Representation Constituency (GRC) and\u00a0Tanjong Pagar GRC MP Joan Pereira on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' efforts during\u00a0the Covid-19 outbreak. \n In his speech, Dr Balakrishnan said that\u00a0the disease\u00a0has now spread globally and\u00a0that diplomacy was key in coordinating information as well as repatriation missions for Singaporeans, when two flights brought back 266 Singaporeans and their families from Wuhan in China's Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak. \n \u201cOur embassy in Beijing had to coordinate closely with the PRC (People\u2019s Republic of China) and Hubei provincial governments to arrange these repatriation missions,\u201d he said. \n Yet, Singapore was aware that its difficult decision to impose travel restrictions on travellers from mainland China could affect\u00a0diplomatic relations,\u00a0Dr Balakrishnan said. \n These measures were not directed at any country, nationality or race, he stressed, adding that stringent measures were necessary to prevent the coronavirus from spreading in Singapore, or being re-exported to other countries. \n In his speech, Mr Sam Tan, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs,\u00a0later explained in Mandarin that high-level officials in China had said that they understood why Singapore had to impose the travel restrictions. \n \u201cWhen Minister Balakrishnan spoke to Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi over the phone early this year, he also thanked the Chinese government for their overwhelming assistance, for letting more than 200\u00a0 Singaporeans and their families to smoothly leave Wuhan via an airplane and return to Singapore,\" Mr Tan said. \n \"At the same time, we also assisted Chinese citizens stranded in Singapore to return to Wuhan.

During the recent Chinese New Year celebrations, the Wuhan virus was the hot topic around my family\u2019s dinner table, with many relatives fretting about how virulent the new coronavirus is. I\u2019m sure similar conversations took place across the island. \n Judging by online activities, the virus is the talk of the town. \u201cWuhan virus\u201d has been a top search term on Google and trending on Twitter for many days now. \n Turn on the television or check out a news website and you will also see plenty of coverage on the Wuhan coronavirus, which the World Health Organisation (WHO) has dubbed 2019-nCoV. \n The outbreak has caused global alarm, and understandably so. It is a new pathogen, and scientists know little about it. \n Fear of the unknown is a very human trait that has helped keep our species alive through the millennia. It keeps us from blundering into potentially dangerous situations without first finding out more about what to expect and how to prepare ourselves. \n But we should also avoid letting our emotions get the better of us. \n Reflexivity \u2014\u00a0the act of critically examining our own thoughts and feelings \u2014\u00a0is important. \n Before concluding that the ongoing viral epidemic is a catastrophe, take a step back and understand the reasons why many people are afraid. \n Much of it has to do with the availability heuristic.\u00a0Heuristics are mental shortcuts our minds use to make thinking faster and less effortful. Unfortunately, they are error-prone. \n The availability heuristic is used when we make judgements about the likelihood of something. Quite often, the judgements we arrive at turn out to be inaccurate. \n A classic example is this: We tend to be afraid of flying in airplanes but not riding in cars. But statistically speaking, we are more likely to die in a car accident than a plane crash. \n Why does the availability heuristic make such mistakes? This is because it judges how likely something is based on how easy it is to think of examples of that thing happening. \n We can think of many examples of fatal plane crashes because such incidents tend to be widely covered by the media. \n But traffic accidents usually go unnoticed because they are an everyday occurrence and the media rarely covers them unless they involve multiple casualties or cause significant damage. \n The influence of the availability heuristic was very apparent in another epidemic \u2014\u00a0the 2009 swine flu, caused by the Influenza A H1N1 virus. \n I was only 12 then, and I remember how the grownups, their eyes glued to the day\u2019s newspaper, spoke to one another in hushed tones about how bad the pandemic was and how many people were dying. \n Eventually, I caught the bug. But it was nothing a three-day stay in an isolation ward and a brief course of Tamiflu couldn\u2019t fix. \n H1N1 is still around today, but has faded into obscurity. It is now just another flu virus \u2014\u00a0one of dozens responsible for the seasonal flu. \n Of course, we now know that the 2009 variant of H1N1 was a relatively mild strain. It infected up to 200 million people but its mortality rate was a modest 0.02 per cent.\u00a0The mortality rate in Singapore was even lower at 0.004 per cent, with 18 fatalities from some 415,000 cases. \n It was a good illustration of how people\u2019s imagined fears, fuelled by media coverage, can make a relatively small problem seem like a huge one thanks to the availability heuristic. \n It\u2019s hard not to overestimate your likelihood of dying from H1N1 if you\u2019re constantly reading reports about how thousands have already succumbed. \n To put the numbers in context, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers) viruses \u2014\u00a0which are cousins of 2019-nCoV \u2014\u00a0have a 10 per cent and 34 per cent mortality rate respectively. \n The mortality rate of 2019-nCoV itself stands at below 3 per cent for now, though this could change if new information emerges about the virus or if it mutates into a more dangerous form. \n Meanwhile, the humble seasonal flu sickens up to a billion people \u2014\u00a0equivalent to roughly 15 per cent of the world\u2019s population \u2014\u00a0every year, killing up to 650,000. \n Although this works out to a mortality rate of less than 1 per cent, the sheer number of cases means that even now, we are far more likely to come down with \u2014\u00a0and subsequently die from \u2014\u00a0the regular flu than the Wuhan virus. \n So if you see someone coughing, keep your mind in check. Don\u2019t immediately assume that they have the Wuhan virus. It\u2019s probably just the regular flu. \n And when you are thinking and discussing with others about the outbreak, do your best to seek out the facts and use logical reasoning. \n Because the virus is new and little is known about it, people may fill the void of information with speculation and hearsay. \n It has already happened here. Fake news that individuals had died from the virus in Singapore has circulated on at least two occasions, forcing the Government to debunk the misinformation and even issue a general correction direction through the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act\u00a0Office. \n It can be very tempting to share such rumours with family and friends, because they are dramatic and prey on our emotions. \n But apply some media literacy techniques first, before deciding whether to press the \u201csend\u201d button. \n Read about past epidemics and how viruses work on free information platforms like Wikipedia. Consume news from multiple outlets so you can corroborate the facts across different sources. \n As Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said on Jan 27 at a press conference about the Wuhan virus situation in Singapore: \u201cThis is not just a fight on the medical front, but a fight on the psychological front. We have to stay together, and do not panic.\u201d \n In short, let\u2019s not scare ourselves unnecessarily, and refrain from scaring one another too. \n \u00a0 \n ABOUT THE AUTHOR: \n Jonathan Tiong is a fourth-year student at the National University of Singapore where he is majoring in Communications and New Media."}, {"content": "Work to start on three possible China virus vaccines: epidemic response group.

On March 12, the Chinese government declared that the peak of broadcasts had ended in the country. The new coronavirus, responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic, has infected more than 210,000 people worldwide, of which more than 8,750 have died. Of those infected, more than 84,000 have recovered from the disease. The outbreak began in China in December and has already spread to 170 countries and territories, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a pandemic situation. The most affected countries after China are Italy with 2,978 deaths for 35,713 cases, Iran with 1,135 deaths (17,350 cases), Spain with 558 deaths (13,716 cases) and France with 175 deaths (7,730 cases). In light of the advance of the pandemic, several countries adopted exceptional measures, including the quarantine regime and the closure of borders.

LONDON - Extending school and work closures at the coronavirus' ground zero in China may delay a second wave of infections, researchers said on Thursday, urging the rest of the world to take note.  \n With containment measures largely successful and the epidemic's epicentre now in Europe, China has loosened a two-month lockdown in the city of Wuhan where the new coronavirus is thought to have jumped from wildlife to people late last year.  \n But a study in The Lancet Public Health journal suggested continuing Wuhan's shutdowns until April would push a potential second wave of COVID-19 - the disease caused by the new virus - until later in the year. That would give health services more time to recover and expand, potentially saving lives.  \n \"The city now needs to be really careful to avoid prematurely lifting physical distancing measures, because that could lead to an earlier secondary peak in cases,\" said Kiesha Prem, a specialist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), who co-led the research.  \n \"If they relax the restrictions gradually, this is likely to both delay and flatten the peak.\"  \n The study used mathematical modelling to simulate either extending or relaxing school and workplace closures in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people whose name has become synonymous with the coronavirus for much of the world.  \n By lifting control measures now, a second rush of infections may occur in late August, the analysis suggested. But keeping lockdown measures until April would likely delay a second peak until October \u2014 giving healthcare workers a chance to regroup.  \n  \n RESURGENCE FEARS  \n Those findings were \"crucial for policy makers everywhere\", said Tim Colbourn, an expert in global health epidemiology at University College London, who was not directly involved in the study.  \n Stunned by the disease's rapid spread, governments around the world are trying to replicate China's draconian lockdown measures while also working out the risk of recurrences once the epidemic peaks have passed in their countries.  \n \"Our results won't look exactly the same in another country,\" said Yang Liu, an LSHTM expert who also worked on the research. \"But we think one thing probably applies everywhere: physical distancing measures are very useful, and we need to carefully adjust their lifting to avoid subsequent waves of infection ... If those waves come too quickly, that could overwhelm health systems.\"  \n World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Wednesday expressed the same view, saying lockdowns were the best way to curb transmission.  \n \"The last thing any country needs is to open schools and businesses only to be forced to close them again because of a resurgence,\" he said.

BEIJING/WASHINGTON/NEW YORK - China is withdrawing the press credentials of American journalists at three U.S. newspapers, intensifying a bitter fight between the world's top two economies that has widened to include the coronavirus outbreak and media freedoms.  \n Beijing announced on Wednesday what it said was retaliation against U.S. restrictions on Chinese journalists that includes revoking the accreditations of American correspondents with the New York Times <NYT.N>, News Corp's <NWSA.O> Wall Street Journal and Washington Post whose credentials expire by the end of 2020.  \n The move is a sharp escalation of a dispute that saw Washington last month force Chinese state media firms to register as foreign embassies.  \n Beijing then expelled three Wall Street Journal correspondents - two Americans and an Australian - following an opinion column by the newspaper that called China the \"real sick man of Asia.\"  \n Washington then slashed the number of journalists permitted to work in the United States at four major Chinese state-owned media outlets to 100, from 160 previously. It cited a \"deepening crackdown\" on independent reporting inside China.  \n Beijing said the expelled journalists would not be permitted to work in mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau. It said they must hand back their press cards within 10 days.  \n The expulsion is expected to affect at least 13 journalists, according to the Foreign Correspondents Club of China, which said it \"deplores\" China's decision.  \n China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment on how many journalists are affected.  \n Beijing also said the China branches of the three papers plus the Voice of America broadcaster and Time magazine must \"declare in written form information about their staff, finance, operation and real estate in China.\"  \n  \n WAR OF WORDS  \n The latest development follows a war of words between Washington and Beijing over the outbreak of the new coronavirus, which causes a highly contagious, sometimes fatal, respiratory illness COVID-19.  \n The virus originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year and has so far killed 7,400 people globally, bringing normal life in many parts of the world to a standstill.  \n U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters at a State Department news conference that Beijing's move on Wednesday would deprive the world and the Chinese people of information in \"incredibly challenging\" times brought about by the coronavirus.  \n \"I regret China's decision today to further foreclose the world's ability to conduct the free press operations that frankly would be really good for the Chinese people,\" he said. \"This is unfortunate... I hope they'll reconsider.\"  \n Media executives denounced the move.  \n \"We unequivocally condemn any action by China to expel U.S. reporters,\" Washington Post Executive Editor Marty Baron said in a statement. \"The Chinese government's decision is particularly regrettable because it comes in the midst of an unprecedented global crisis, when clear and reliable information about the international response to COVID-19 is essential.\"  \n Dean Baquet, executive editor at The New York Times, also condemned the decision.  \n \"It is a grave mistake for China to move backwards and cut itself off from several of the world's top news organizations,\" he said.  \n Matt Murray, editor in chief at The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Newswires, said: \"We oppose government interference with a free press anywhere in the world. Our commitment to reporting fully and deeply on China is unchanged.\"  \n Time Editor in Chief and CEO Edward Felsenthal said: \"We oppose any effort by the Chinese government or any other government to expel reporters or intimidate those whose job is to provide accurate information, especially during this crucial period for the world.\"  \n A representative of Voice of America was not immediately reachable.  \n  \n 'ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS'  \n A striking aspect of Beijing's move was its decision to bar the journalists from working in Hong Kong and Macau, two semi-autonomous territories of China with their own media accreditation rules. In the past, foreign journalists kicked out of China were allowed to work in Hong Kong.  \n That raised questions about Hong Kong's autonomy under the \"one country, two systems\" agreement that still prevails between the territory and the mainland.  \n \"There's no precedent for China dictating who can and can\u2019t report from Hong Kong openly,\" said Steven Butler, the Committee to Protect Journalists' Asia programme coordinator. \"It very seriously erodes Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy and freedom of the press.\"  \n The Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club in Hong Kong said it was alarmed at the decision to expel the journalists and even more concerned that they would be banned from working as journalists in Hong Kong.  \n It said Hong Kong must provide assurances that foreign journalists working in Hong Kong and those applying to work in the city will continue to be issued employment visas without interference from the Chinese government.  \n Beijing said on Wednesday that its actions \"are entirely necessary and reciprocal countermeasures that China is compelled to take in response to the unreasonable oppression the Chinese media organizations experience in the United States.\"  \n Pompeo said he did not think Beijing's latest move was a balanced response. \"This isn't apples to apples,\" he said, charging that the Chinese journalists who had faced restrictions were part of \"propaganda outlets.\"  \n China has repeatedly denounced the Wall Street Journal's \"sick man\" column as racist and, after the newspaper declined to apologise, revoked the visas of the three reporters in Beijing. Another reporter with the paper had to leave last year after China declined to renew his visa. REUTERS"}, {"content": "China reports 5,000 new coronavirus cases, cruise ship disembarks in Cambodia.

The World Health Organization (WHO) announced this Tuesday that the epidemic of the new coronavirus that has emerged in China is not yet a pandemic. &quot;Currently, we are not in a pandemic situation,&quot; a term that applies to a situation of global spread of a disease, said Sylvie Briand, director of WHO&#39;s department of global preparedness for infectious risks. &quot;We are in an epidemic phase with multiple outbreaks&quot;, she added to the press.

How a worldwide pandemic can create a political \u201cpandemonium\u201d. The spread of Covid-19 and the imminence of a large-scale pandemic could affect global geopolitics and are putting governments with social problems that are difficult to resolve. Analysts consulted by Lusa agency believe that a pandemic can create situations of &quot;pandemonium&quot; and stress that several government officials fear the social repercussions of the uncontrolled spread of the virus in a &quot;global village&quot; where phenomena do not recognize borders. A visible case of this concern is the US President: concerned about the impact of the new coronavirus on his re-election bid this November, Trump prevented a US citizen, who had been infected on the Diamond Princess ship in Japan, from being treated in his home state of Alabama, calling Republican senator Richard Shelby to make sure his instruction was carried out. Analysts say the impact of Covid-19 in the US elections could be a &quot;double-edged sword&quot;: in the first instance, the US economy is affected in the long term, weakening the position of Trump, who has used the flag. economic performance; in a second scenario, the outbreak is short-lived, affecting the production of goods for a few months, with supply resuming on election eve, in a compact form, favoring Trump&#39;s position. According to the North American newspaper Politico, Trump has already asked his advisers to analyze all the scenarios and requested a detailed report on emergency measures from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC, in a document made public, warned the US President of the risk of &quot;the public health system becoming overcrowded, with high rates of hospitalization and deaths&quot;, also warning of the impact of a pandemic on transport systems. The problem is global and the big variable is to know what dimension it will reach, says Jos\u00e9 Pedro Teixeira Fernandes, a researcher at the Portuguese Institute of International Relations (IPRI-Nova). Speaking to Lusa, this expert warns of the risks that governments run if a pandemic spreads for long periods of time. &quot;The problem is of a degree&quot;, explains Teixeira Fernandes, referring to a situation that may involve many thousands of people infected in the same country, over a long period, affecting not only health services, but also the supply chains of goods. essential. For now, in Europe, where cases of infection are beginning to multiply in various regions, governments are looking for mechanisms to contain the disease, triggering administrative mechanisms for the isolation of the virus. Even in France, where there is a strong tradition of individual rights - which make it impossible, for example, that a person who decides to disappear cannot be searched by the police, even under the pretext of &quot;family interest&quot; - the government has announced that it will make mandatory hospitalization for infected people. The issue of mandatory hospitalization of a patient infected with a highly contagious virus is being discussed in several countries, including Portugal, where experts are divided in the legal reading of solutions. Constantino Sakellarides, a specialist in Public Health and who was responsible for the General Directorate of Health in Portugal, said that Portuguese law allows for the mandatory quarantine of a patient infected with the virus and even provides for the possibility of declaring a state of calamity, which should be proposed by the Government to the President of the Republic. In the opposite direction, Francisco George, who was also Director General of Health, considers that it will be necessary to make changes to the Constitution to institute mandatory internment for reasons of public health. &quot;In Portugal, it is time for deputies of the Assembly of the Republic to amend subparagraph h) of number 3, of article 27 of the Constitution, in order to allow mandatory internment for reasons of Public Health. It cannot be postponed&quot;, wrote Francisco George, in an opinion piece recently published in the P\u00fablico newspaper. Caroline Barnett, professor of public health at the University of Paris, says the risk of this kind of measure increases with the scale of the problem. &quot;The problem is when the state seeks the mandatory internment of hundreds or thousands of people, often without ensuring the proper conditions for all these internments,&quot; Barnett told Lusa, referring to a scenario that could occur in several countries, the short term. For this expert, an uncontrolled situation of virus propagation can lead to political &quot;pandemonium&quot;, with several governments having to recognize their inability to deal with thousands of deaths and health systems deficient in the means to receive millions of infected. In Europe, the European Commission is looking for solutions that are less intrusive than mandatory internment, with mechanisms for isolating the spread of the virus that avoid the need for compulsory internment, namely through the activation of the European Civil Protection &quot;pool&quot; - an organization established to streamline coordination of efforts among member countries for rapid response to disasters. A relevant political decision in the European community concerns the closure of borders in the Schengen area, which the European Commission said this week is not yet being considered. European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, Stella Kyriakides, said the World Health Organization has not advised restrictions in Europe to justify moving away from this solution. Jos\u00e9 Pedro Teixeira Fernandes recalls that such a measure goes against the very spirit of Schengen, but recognizes that an emergency situation can justify it, for a short period of time. The governments of Italy and France, whose countries border each other, have announced that they are aware of this possibility, after the Italian provinces of Lombardy and Veneto have been heavily affected by the spread of the new coronavirus. For the rest, the Italian Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte, has been criticized by regional authorities for his more relaxed approach to the issue of coronavirus, even criticizing local decisions to close schools and other public spaces. Conte tried to allay fears that his government would not be able to contain the virus after he was forced to admit that a hospital in northern Italy had poorly treated a case of infection, contributing to the spread of Covid-19. Politically, the most delicate border is the one that separates Italy from Austria, two countries that are in open confrontation over the discussion of the European budget and that also seem to have different views on how best to contain the coronavirus. The Austrian government has already given signs that it would like to see the borders better guarded, but the Italian government has said it sees no reason to suspend Schengen, asking the European Commission to quickly release the 232 million euro fund to curb the spread of Schengen. Covid-19. Diplomatically, the problem is also serving as a pretext to regulate the growing flow of Chinese tourists in some Asian regions. Singapore authorities are blocking Chinese entry into the territory after the territory&#39;s minister of business and industry announced that the tourism sector was overly dependent on China, using virus protection measures to justify medium and long term in moderating its entry. Teixeira Fernandes recalls that the Covid-19 case is a strong threat to the position of China, the initial focus of the epidemic, at the moment it is launching its economic expansion program, especially in the face of the United States, with which it has a trade war for nearly two years. The IPRI-Nova specialist recalls yet another case of a country in conflict with the United States, Iran, which is also grappling with a serious problem with the spread of the virus, which will also be weakened by its enemies."}, {"content": "A nightmare for us, a miracle for the environment? Covid-19 can have significant impacts on CO2 emissions. Months ago, no one, not even Greta Thunberg, would have dared to draw such a radical scenario: that a pandemic could be responsible for the biggest decrease in carbon dioxide emissions, worldwide, in the last decade. In other words, that a humanitarian dystopia could turn into a kind of ecological miracle. With the drop in oil consumption, the world is emitting a million tons less carbon dioxide a day. And all this because of Covid-19. The International Energy Agency (IEA) this week released a report that indicates global demand for oil is set to contract this year for the first time since 2009. That the pandemic is having an impact on the environment is beyond doubt. In China alone, where the new coronavirus emerged, there has been a 25% drop in CO2 emissions in recent months due to factories that have closed in Hubei province. If this trend continues, wrote Environment Editor Jonathan Watts two weeks ago, global emissions could drop to 2008/09 values, before the financial crisis. Even the drastic reduction in home-work and work-home travel across Europe is not to be factored into the equation. \u201cThe idea that we need to move, every day, to a central location to work can be the result of inertia more than anything else. Faced with the real need to move around using the mouse [the computer] rather than the car, we may find that the benefits of work flexibility extend to everything from gasoline consumption to the need for large office parking lots.\u201d , American environmentalist Bill McKibben told the British daily. However, if it is true that emissions \u2013 at the industrial and aviation level \u2013 are plummeting, the increase in energy consumption by citizens who are in quarantine also weighs on the balance of emissions. \u201cIf you come to a cold house and you have to heat it, it will incur costs that, on average, will not offset the savings from not having to drive to work,\u201d explained Christopher Jones, climate policy expert at the University of California, to \u201cScientific American\u201d magazine. A coincidence: in 2016, the United Nations determined that the limit that would be imposed on carbon emissions on international flights would be based on values \u200b\u200brecorded in the year 2020. The expectation was that airlines would continue to grow \u2013 and emissions from CO2 too, of course \u2013 and so a ceiling was set; since 2013, emissions have increased by 26%, it should be noted. Now, due to Covid-19, it has been almost decades since there were so few planes in the air, and emissions were so low, notes the \u201cIndependent\u201d. World air traffic dropped 4.3% in February; in China, the number was more radical: 70%. The pandemic significantly reduced the average volume of CO2 emissions. The number of planes in the air \u2013 at least at the European level \u2013 is minimal. \u201cOne possible beneficial outcome of the virus, if we can see some light in this tragedy, is that the baseline [determined by the UN] is 2020, and right now aviation is a kind of flat line,\u201d said Katherine Kramer, responsible for climate change at the Christian Aid association, in the British Parliament, this Wednesday. That is, by the end of the year, if there is no change in the UN calendar, the \u201cemissions baseline will be much lower\u201d than was expected four years ago, she explained. Remember: aviation is one of the sectors that contribute most to climate change: in 2018, domestic and international flights emitted around 895 million tons of CO2."}, {"content": "Unlike other countries, Portugal does not require returnees to quarantine.

Everything is in place, including with regard to \u201ctherapeutics and diagnostic methods to be implemented\u201d, says Fernando Maltez. In the case of the hospital in S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o, in Porto, the prevention plan \u2013 which will be updated \u201caccording to knowledge of the evolution of the epidemic\u201d \u2013 includes specific \u201cphysical spaces and means\u201d that are allocated to this response.

But it said it would ensure that inflation remains within its fresh target.\nOn the recent budget announcements, RBI said income tax concessions under the new optional regime will help boost domestic demand and welcomed the government\u2019s infrastructure push.\nShaktikanta Das also admitted that RBI is concerned about the recent developments on global trade due to the coronavirus outbreak.\nHere are some key takeaways from RBI\u2019s sixth bi-monthly monetary policy review in 2019-20.\nOutput gap negative\nThough RBI expects private consumption to drive growth in the upcoming fiscal, it says the output gap remains negative in the present scenario due to a mix of domestic and global economic factors. While RBI did not opt for a rate cut, Governor Shaktikanta Das said the central bank has enough tools at its disposal to act if economy weakens further.\nFY21 growth outlook\nRBI has estimated GDP growth at 6 per cent for 2020-21. For the first six months of the next fiscal, growth has been predicted at 5.6-6.2 per cent while 6.2 per cent rate has been estimated for the third quarter of FY21. RBI\u2019s projection indicates that an economic recovery can be expected by the second half of 2020-21, given there is a steady decline in inflation and other domestic disturbances.\nBudget commentary\nShaktikanta Das said the RBI welcomed decisions taken by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in Budget 2020-21, especially on the tax front and the government\u2019s infrastructure outlay. He said the income tax concessions under the optional income tax rate will boost consumer demand while the infra push was in line with higher rural spending.\nCoronavirus concern \nThe Reserve Bank of India expressed serious concern over the coronavirus outbreak in China with respect to global trade. It said the rapidly spreading virus, which has globally claimed than 500 lives, may even impact India\u2019s economy adversely. However, Governor Das said the impact of the coronavirus outbreak is uncertain till now. He also called for a rapid action plan to deal with the growing trade drawbacks due to the outbreak. In India, there are no new cases of coronavirus after three from Kerala were diagnosed positive. But businesses in India are already facing the heat of the outbreak. The diamond industry in Surat says it could lose business up to Rs 8,000 crore as key markets continue to remain shut. Companies from all sectors who import materials from China are also facing the heat.\nInflation projection hiked\nRBI continues to remain worried about inflation, especially since demand for food commodities have increased globally after the coronavirus outbreak. RBI has projected CPI inflation upwards to 6.5 per cent for the present quarter and 5.4 per cent for the first half of FY21, which is expected to go down to 3.21 per cent in the third quarter of FY21. While inflation projection has been increased from the earlier policy review, inflation is expected to come down as a result of falling vegetable prices, especially onions. A better Rabi sowing season may also contain inflation.\nDon\u2019t Discount RBI \nRBI said its policy stance should not be seen as a future policy action and that it has many ways of tackling economic growth when required. Shaktikanta Das said RBI will continue to maintain an accommodative stance, indicating that it will act whenever necessary to beat slowdown. Have many instruments at our disposal to address slowdown, Das said.\nSmall saving schemes interest rates \nThe RBI\u2019s MPC also indicated that there is a need for adjustment in interest rates for small savings schemes. Small savings school include the Public Provident Fund (PPF), National Savings Certificate (NSC) and others. It remains to be seen whether the government acts on the RBI\u2019s advice.\nGood Rabi sowing\nAnother positive mentioned by the MPC is higher Rabi sowing of 9.5 per cent up to January 31. Production of vegetables was also estimated to go up by 2.6 per cent, as per the MPC. This is a good indication as it could lead to moderation in the prices of vegetables.\nBetter indicators \nWhile there are some existing factors that need to be addressed, RBI said there has been an improvement in industrial activity. The Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), prepared by IHS Markit, rose from 52.7 in December 2019 to 55.3 in January 2020. India\u2019s service sector activity also touched a seven-year high in January, indicating a recovery.

WASHINGTON, March 22 (Reuters) - Several months before the coronavirus pandemic began, the Trump administration eliminated a key American public health position in Beijing intended to help detect disease outbreaks in China, Reuters has learned.\nThe American disease expert, a medical epidemiologist embedded in China\u2019s disease control agency, left her post in July, according to four sources with knowledge of the issue. The first cases of the new coronavirus may have emerged as early as November, and as cases exploded, the Trump administration in February chastised China for censoring information about the outbreak and keeping U.S. experts from entering the country to help.\n\u201cIt was heartbreaking to watch,\u201d said Bao-Ping Zhu, a Chinese American who served in that role, which was funded by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between 2007 and 2011. \u201cIf someone had been there, public health officials and governments across the world could have moved much faster.\u201d\nZhu and the other sources said the American expert, Dr. Linda Quick, was a trainer of Chinese field epidemiologists who were deployed to the epicenter of outbreaks to help track, investigate and contain diseases.  As an American CDC employee, they said, Quick was in an ideal position to be the eyes and ears on the ground for the United States and other countries on the coronavirus outbreak, and might have alerted them to the growing threat weeks earlier.\nNo other foreign disease experts were embedded to lead the program after Quick left in July, according to the sources. Zhu said an embedded expert can often get word of outbreaks early, after forming close relationships with Chinese counterparts.\nZhu and the other sources said Quick could have provided real-time information to U.S. and other officials around the world during the first weeks of the outbreak, when they said the Chinese government tamped down on the release of information and provided erroneous assessments.\nQuick left amid a bitter U.S. trade dispute with China when she learned her federally funded post, officially known as resident adviser to the U.S. Field Epidemiology Training Program in China, would be discontinued as of September, the sources said. The U.S. CDC said it first learned of a \u201ccluster of 27 cases of pneumonia\u201d of unexplained origin in Wuhan, China, on Dec. 31.\nSince then, the outbreak of the disease known as COVID-19 has spread rapidly worldwide, killing more than 13,600 people, infecting more than 317,000. The epidemic has overwhelmed healthcare systems some countries, including Italy, and threatens to do so in the United States and elsewhere.\nIn a statement to Reuters, the U.S. CDC said the elimination of the adviser position did not hinder Washington\u2019s ability to get information and \u201chad absolutely nothing to do with CDC not learning of cases in China earlier.\u201d\nThe agency said its decision not to have a resident adviser \u201cstarted well before last summer and was due to China\u2019s excellent technical capability and maturity of the program.\u201d\nThe CDC said it has assigned two of its Chinese employees as \u201cmentors\u201d to help with the training program. The agency did not respond to questions about the mentors\u2019 specific role or expertise.\n\u201cCDC has had a 30-year partnership with China CDC and close collaboration,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe had the right staff to engage China and ability to provide technical assistance were it requested.\u201d\nThe CDC would not make Quick, who still works for the agency, available for comment.\nAsked for comment on Chinese transparency and responsiveness to the outbreak, China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs referred Reuters to remarks by spokesman Geng Shuang on Friday. Geng said the country \u201chas adopted the strictest, most comprehensive, and most thorough prevention and control measures in an open, transparent, and responsible manner, and informed the (World Health Organization) and relevant countries and regions of the latest situation in a timely manner.\u201d\nOne disease expert told Reuters he was skeptical that the U.S. resident adviser would have been able to get earlier or better information to the Trump administration, given the Chinese government\u2019s suppression of information.\n\u201cIn the end, based on circumstances in China, it probably wouldn\u2019t have had made a big difference,\u201d Scott McNabb, who was a CDC epidemiologist for 20 years and is now a research professor at Emory University. \u201cThe problem was how the Chinese handled it. What should have changed was the Chinese should have acknowledged it earlier and didn\u2019t.\u201d\nAlex Azar, secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS)said Friday that his agency learned of the coronavirus in early January, based on Redfield\u2019s conversations with \u201cChinese colleagues.\u201d\nRedfield learned that \u201cthis looks to be a novel coronavirus\u201d from Dr. Gao Fu, the head of the China CDC, according to an HHS administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \u201cDr. Redfield always talked to Dr. Gao,\u201d the official said.\nHHS and CDC did not make Azar or Redfield available for comment.\nZhu and other sources said U.S. leaders should not have been relying on the China CDC director for alerts and updates. In general, they said, officials in China downplayed the severity of the outbreak in the early weeks and did not acknowledge evidence of person-to-person transmission until Jan. 20.\nAfter the epidemic exploded and China had imposed strict quarantines, Trump administration officials complained that the Chinese had censored information about the outbreak and that the United States had been unable to get American disease experts into the country to help contain the spread.\nAzar told CNN on Feb. 14 that he and CDC director Redfield officially offered to send a CDC team into China on Jan. 6 but still had not received permission for them to enter the country. HHS oversees the CDC.\n\u201cDr. Redfield and I made the offer on January 6th - 36 days ago, 60,000 cases and 1,300 deaths ago,\u201d Azar said. \u201cWe made the offer to send the CDC experts in to assist their Chinese colleagues to get to the bottom of key scientific questions like, how transmissible is this disease?

Last week, the Chinese government announced that Americans from three U.S. news organizations, The New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, would be expelled from China.\nThe decision to eliminate Quick\u2019s job came as the CDC has scaled back the number of U.S. staffers in China over the last two years, the sources told Reuters.\n\u201cWe had already withdrawn many technical public health experts,\u201d  the same expert said.\nThe CDC, however, disputed that staffing was a problem or that its information had been limited by the move.  \u201cIt was not the staffing shortage that limited our ability\u201d it said.\nThe U.S. CDC team in Beijing now includes three American citizens in permanent roles, an additional American who is temporary and around 10 Chinese nationals, the agency said. Of the Americans, one is an influenza expert with expertise in respiratory disease.

No American CDC staffer besides Quick was embedded with China\u2019s disease control agency, the sources said.\nChina in recent weeks has reported a dramatic slowdown in new cases, the result of drastic containment measures including the lockdown of Hubei province, home to 60 million people. Nevertheless, the infectious disease experts who spoke with Reuters said, the United States could use people like Quick with contacts on the ground, especially if fears of a second wave of infections materializes.\nThomas R. Frieden, a former director of the CDC, said that if the U.S. resident adviser had still been in China, \u201cit is possible that we would know more today about how this coronavirus is spreading and what works best to stop it.\u201d\nDr. George Conway, a medical epidemiologist who knows Quick and had served as resident advisor between 2012 and 2015, said funding for the position had been tenuous for years because of a perennial debate among U.S health officials over whether China should be paying for funding its own training program.\nYet since the training program was launched in 2001, the sources familiar with it say, it has not only strengthened the ranks of Chinese epidemiologists in the field, but also fostered collegial relationships between public health officials in the two countries.\n\u201cWe go there as credentialed diplomats and return home as close colleagues and often as friends,\u201d Conway said.\nIn 2007, Dr. Robert Fontaine, a CDC epidemiologist  and one of the longest serving U.S. officials in the adviser\u2019s position, received China\u2019s highest honor for outstanding contributions to public health due to his contribution as a foreigner in helping to detect and investigate clusters of pneumonia of unknown cause.\nBut since last year, Frieden and others said, growing tensions between the Trump administration and China\u2019s leadership have apparently damaged the collaboration.\n\u201cThe message from the administration was, \u2018Don\u2019t work with China, they\u2019re our rival,\u2019\u201d Frieden said.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Situated in central China, the city of Wuhan was placed under a de facto quarantine last week, with exits and entries banned by authorities for an indefinite period, taking residents by surprise. The Portuguese government initially considered a withdrawal by land to Shanghai, in eastern China, from where the Portuguese would fly to Portugal. However, passage over land would require authorization from the provinces that separate Hubei from Shanghai, which would take longer and would require Portuguese citizens to be quarantined in one of those territories before leaving China. The Portuguese government is also considering carrying out that operation in conjunction with evacuation efforts from other EU countries, within the European mechanism foreseen for this type of situation. The Wuhan region is under quarantine, a situation that affects 56 million people.

The spread of the new type of corona virus in China is now also dampening consumer sentiment in this country. After an optimistic start to the new year, it has worsened somewhat. In its monthly consumer climate index, the Nuremberg market researcher GfK predicts a decline of 0.1 points to 9.8 points for March. In the previous month the value had risen by 0.2 points. The company cited the uncertainty caused by the spread of the coronavirus as the reason for the stagnating development. Because of the strong interdependence of the economy, this could also have an impact on companies in Germany, said GfK consumer expert Rolf B\u00fcrkl on Thursday in Nuremberg. \u201cIf the supply of intermediate products or parts from China is interrupted, this has a negative effect on employment in our company. The threat of short-time work and job losses then depress consumer sentiment, \u201dhe explained. The corona virus may also have negative effects on German exports to China. \u201cThe growth forecasts are being scaled back significantly in China. Purchasing power is also no longer available to that extent - of course that also applies to Germany as an export nation, \u201demphasized B\u00fcrkl. Despite the economic weakness caused by the trade dispute between the USA and China and the corona virus, the signals from the German labor market have so far been encouraging, which is stabilizing consumer sentiment overall, the expert said. Due to the stable employment situation, employees could expect income increases this year as well, even if they were not as high as they were last year. The pensioners could also hope for a substantial increase in their salaries. Supported by the low interest rate policy of the European Central Bank, the propensity to buy is also maintaining its good level, according to GfK. At 53.6 points, this indicator is slightly above the comparative value of the previous year. In contrast, consumers&#39; propensity to save remains in the basement. \u201cSaving is and will not remain a very attractive alternative to consumption,\u201d said B\u00fcrkl. In contrast, private consumption remains an important factor in the stability of the economy. According to the expert, GfK is maintaining its forecast that private consumption will increase by one percent this year. For the past year, the forecast was an increase of 1.5 percent. When it comes to economic growth in Germany, the Nuremberg market researchers are also assuming an increase of 1.0 percent in the current year.

China will cut tariffs on US products worth 75 billion dollars (68 billion euros) in half from February 14, the Ministry of Finance announced in Beijing on Thursday. The second world power thus fulfills the conditions of the trade truce signed with Trump in January. Meanwhile, Washington is preparing to adopt reciprocal measures. The decision comes at a time of tension between the two countries after China protested the American reaction to the coronavirus epidemic. The cut will be applied to the tariffs imposed since last September 1 on 1,600 products such as soybeans, seafood, poultry or tungsten lamps for medical research. After this decision, the rates of 10% will go to 5%, and those that were at 5% will be cut to 2.5%. The announcement comes a month after US President Donald Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He signed a truce in the trade war that both countries have been waging for almost two years in Washington. Among other commitments, China agreed to increase its purchases of US products by about $ 200 billion over the next two years. But after that agreement the confrontation between the two powers grew. Beijing has accused the US of generating panic over the disease after it was the first country to ban the entry of travelers from China and also the first to evacuate its consular staff from Wuhan, the city where the epidemic began. . &quot;The US has yet to offer any substantial aid to China. What he has done can only generate and spread fear, &quot;a Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Monday. China now says that it remains committed to the goal of eliminating all additional levies on respective imports imposed since the trade war began in early 2018. Beijing had already announced the cancellation of the rate increase it applied to various medical products from the United States. To facilitate their importation and use them in the fight against the coronavirus, which has already killed 566 patients - almost all in China - and infected more than 28,000 people in this country. The economic impact of the coronavirus exacerbates fears that Beijing will not be able to expand its purchases of US products on time. The White House economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, had declared that the epidemic, which has paralyzed the economic activity of the second world power, will delay purchases. Since the beginning of the quarantine in a dozen cities in Hubei, the focus of the epidemic, and the prolonged stoppage due to the lunar New Year holidays, then extended to avoid a massive return operation, the factories continue to be closed. He is not the only one who has pointed out that possibility. The Global Times newspaper, controlled by the Communist Party, pointed out that the Xi Jinping government is considering appealing a clause that provides exemptions in compliance with the trade truce with the United States due to force majeure - \u201cnatural disaster or other unforeseeable event outside the control of the parties \u201d- due to the impact of the coronavirus. The newspaper, which quotes a trade expert close to the Chinese government that it does not identify, clarifies that it is unlikely that talks with Washington on the possibility of applying this clause would not begin until after the first quarter. Analysts are confident that the coronavirus, and the tough measures China has taken to try to prevent its spread, will have a significant, if only temporary, effect. Oxford Economics lowered its growth forecast for China for this year from 6% to 5.4%, although it considered a recovery likely in the second quarter.

[L3N2AO07M]  \n \"The Trump administration continues to take the spread of the COVID-19 Coronavirus Disease very seriously. Today, the administration is transmitting to Congress a $2.5 billion supplemental funding plan to accelerate vaccine development, support preparedness and response activities and to procure much needed equipment and supplies,\" said Rachel Semmel, a spokeswoman for the White House Office of Management and Budget.  \n The money will be used for therapeutics, vaccine development and the stockpiling of personal protective equipment such as masks, the White House said.  \n Of the $2.5 billion request, $1.5 billion represents new funding. The rest would come from funds already budgeted by Congress, such as unused money to fight the Ebola virus.

He has sought to downplay the impact of the virus, saying it could fade in April with warmer weather - something health experts said is unknown.  \n Trump has praised the work of Chinese President Xi Jinping, even as his advisers have questioned the reliability of the information Beijing has shared on the virus and expressed frustration over its reluctance to accept U.S. expertise in combating it.  \n The Trump administration is also grappling with where to send Americans evacuated from the Diamond Princess who tested positive for the virus after backing off plans to quarantine them in a federal facility in Alabama.  \n In a statement on Monday, HHS cited a \"rapidly evolving situation,\" but said the Alabama centre was \"not needed at this time\" and that it was looking for alternatives.

SINGAPORE - An estimated 20 per cent of the people infected with the Wuhan virus will become very ill, such as with more severe pneumonia, says a Singapore infectious diseases expert. \n That is the current estimate and this may change when more is known about the Wuhan coronavirus, also known as the 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), says Dr Shawn Vasoo, the acting clinical director at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). \n There are currently four confirmed cases of the 2019-novel coronavirus in Singapore. The patients had all travelled from China where the virus is spreading fast. \n With concerns growing, The Straits Times asked Dr Vasoo to explain what else is known about the virus that has so far reportedly killed more than 50 people in China. \n A: In some people, the virus infects the lower respiratory tract (lungs) and this results in pneumonia. Not everyone will get pneumonia but in most diagnosed cases so far, pneumonia, of varying severities, has been commonly described. \n A: As there are currently no proven specific anti-viral medications for the 2019-novel coronavirus, one overcomes the infection with our immune system, and recovers thereafter. \n Not all cases of pneumonia are severe, but most patients who have fared poorly are those who have gone on to develop severe pneumonia. \n Severe cases may have more concurrent chronic medical problems such as cardiovascular disease or lung disease. \n Currently, an estimated 20 per cent of the people infected with the 2019-novel coronavirus will become very ill (more severe pneumonia). However, this estimate may change as we learn more about this disease. \n A: The common symptoms include fever, cough, in more severe cases, shortness of breath, especially when there is pneumonia. Occasionally some symptoms may be absent, for example fever. \n A: It is not possible to distinguish clearly between the common cold, influenza and the 2019-novel coronavirus. \n Even influenza, which is more common, can lead to severe disease and pneumonia. It also causes death. \n However, unlike in Wuhan, there is currently no widespread community transmission in Singapore. \n Hence, we would be concerned about a possible 2019-novel coronavirus infection only if one has travelled to China or if one has been in contact with a known case of the infection. \n As for dengue, respiratory symptoms are less common and fever, rash, muscle aches and headaches are more common. \n A: You should seek medical attention if you are not feeling well in general, particularly if symptoms have not improved in two to three days. You should seek immediate medical attention if you have risk factors for the 2019-novel coronavirus as described above, so your doctor can assess you. \n A: If you have symptoms you can see your family doctor or polyclinic who will make the initial assessment. \n If more urgent medical attention is needed, or if it is a medical emergency, you should seek medical attention at the nearest emergency clinic or hospital. \n A: Avoid travelling to affected areas, in particular the Hubei province. If you are travelling to China, you should exercise caution and observe good hand hygiene (hand washing or use of hand sanitisers) and avoid crowded places. \n A photo of a man with a mask on at Plaza Singapura MRT on Jan 26, 2020. ST PHOTO: KELLY HUI \n A: As infection by the 2019-novel coronavirus and other common respiratory viruses are spread by respiratory droplets carrying the virus, surgical masks can prevent inhalation of these droplets. \n You should wear a surgical mask if you are ill to prevent spreading whatever respiratory virus you have to others (this is most commonly influenza and the common cold viruses). This is part of being civic conscious. \n Surgical masks may help prevent infection from respiratory viruses in general, if one is around sick people. \n Those who are more prone to infection, such as the elderly or those with poor immune systems, would want to consider wearing them. \n I would discourage the routine use of N95 masks as mask fitting is typically required for its proper use. \n It is also more stuffy and uncomfortable if used for prolonged periods, and may actually be less effective than a surgical mask if used improperly. \n There is no known transmission of the 2019-novel coronavirus in the community in Singapore at this point, so the routine use of a mask to prevent this particular infection is probably unnecessary. \n However, If you are going to an affected area, you should strongly consider the use of a surgical face mask. \n A: This may vary, as patients have developed symptoms as early as in two days while others may develop symptoms later, for example in 10 to 14 days. The average is estimated to be about one week. \n A: You are most likely infectious when you have symptoms, in particular fever and cough."}, {"content": "Malaysian diplomatic missions to continue operations in china - Wisma Putra.

After new evidence of infection with the Sars-CoV-2 coronavirus became known, hope has faded to keep the lung disease out of Germany. What is being done to contain the spread and what is known about the virus and the disease? According to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), a further import of cases to Germany must be expected. Further transmissions of Sars-CoV-2, chains of infection and outbreaks in the country are also possible. Local infections could initially remain undetected, said the Vice President of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), Lars Schaade, on Wednesday in the RBB. It is &quot;quite possible that we do not all recognize these outbreaks immediately&quot;. One must expect that this will lead to further spread. The experts currently estimate the risk to the health of the population in Germany to be low to moderate. A wave of infections in this country could mean, among other things, full waiting areas and doctor&#39;s offices, occupied intensive care beds and completely overloaded health departments, the Berlin virologist Christian Drosten recently explained. Experts see it as problematic that the annual flu wave is currently rolling through Germany - and the health system is already putting a lot of strain on the health system. For this reason, the goal is to delay the spread of the coronavirus as much as possible, as the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) recently explained. &quot;We have to try to slow down the spread with reasonable effort in order to alleviate an intense stress pulse on the health system,&quot; said Drosten. \u201cThe number of infections should be extended over the longest possible period of time.\u201d It is still not possible to give a certain value of how many other people an infected person infects on average. The virus spreads through droplet infection, for example when coughing and speaking. Initial results indicate that the virus can also be spread via the digestive system and surfaces for at least a few days. According to Clemens Wendtner, chief physician of infectious diseases and tropical medicine at the Munich Clinic Schwabing, a previously underestimated risk may be that \u201cquite relevant amounts\u201d of Sars-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples from patients in the initial phase of Covid-19 disease , explained. That is still a difficult question. The RKI says that there are currently insufficient data for a final assessment of the severity of the new respiratory disease. According to an analysis recently presented by China&#39;s health authority, 2.3 percent of those infected with Sars-CoV-2 die in the country. The elderly and those with serious pre-existing conditions such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes are particularly affected. For people over 80 years of age, the death rate calculated from the data available there is just under 15 percent, so an average of around 15 out of 100 infected people in this age group in China die. In the group of 10 to 39 year olds, 0.2 percent of those infected die, i.e. around 2 out of 1,000 people affected. Experts assume that the mortality is actually lower than calculated in China, among other things because many mild infections are not recorded in the Chinese statistics. So far, however, there are no reliable analyzes of mortality from other countries. Most people have mild cold symptoms with chills and a sore throat or no symptoms at all. In addition, there can be a fever, cough and breathing problems, such as those that occur with the flu. Headaches or diarrhea are also possible. According to the Chinese health authority, more than 80 percent of those infected have a mild course of infection, and almost 14 percent become seriously ill. Almost five percent have life-threatening effects such as respiratory arrest, septic shock or multiple organ failure. The incubation period - the period between infection and the onset of symptoms - is usually 2 to 14 days according to the current status. That is why suspected cases are isolated for two weeks. There is no special therapy for Covid-19. Seriously ill patients are treated symptomatically: with antipyretic agents, therapy for any additional bacterial infections and sometimes mechanical ventilation. In individual cases, antiviral drugs are also tested. No. A number of laboratories around the world are currently researching vaccines such as those available for the flu. However, developing a vaccine takes a long time. WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan believes the first vaccine tests on humans could begin in three to four months. A certified vaccine for widespread use will probably only be available in 18 months. The US biotech company Moderna reported on Monday that it had developed a vaccine candidate and delivered it to the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Its director Anthony Fauci announced the first clinical studies for the end of April, according to CNN. He also calculated that it would take one to a year and a half before a vaccine is available. To protect against this and other viruses, experts recommend normal hygiene measures: regular hand washing, disinfectants and distance from the sick. Experts estimate the benefits of normal breathing masks - as can currently be seen everywhere on the streets in China and other countries - to be rather low. It can help to limit hugs and handshakes and not to touch surfaces that have been touched by many people, such as doorknobs, grab handles and elevator buttons. In principle, it is unclear how long the virus will survive on surfaces, says the World Health Organization. Studies suggested that it could be a few hours or days, depending on conditions such as surface, temperature or humidity. The authority rates the probability that an infected person contaminates goods with the virus as low. The risk of a recipient being infected by a parcel that is exposed to different conditions and temperatures during transport is also low. Imported food and goods such as toys, computers or clothing are also unlikely sources of infection, says the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment. Experts emphasize the importance of observing general hygiene rules, such as washing your hands regularly. According to the RKI, anyone who has had contact with an infected person should first contact their health department, regardless of whether symptoms have occurred or not. Travelers from risk areas who have symptoms should consult a doctor after making an appointment by telephone with reference to the trip. The essentials are regulated by the nationwide Infection Protection Act (IfSG). A spokesman for the Bavarian Ministry of Health sums up: &quot;If necessary, important basic rights such as freedom of the person, freedom of assembly or inviolability of the home as well as the right to physical integrity can be restricted.&quot; Require skin and mucous membranes. Also \u201csuspects of illness\u201d and \u201csuspects of contagion\u201d - as the law puts it - can be banned from working. To protect others, people could also be &quot;isolated in a suitable hospital or in some other suitable manner,&quot; says the law."}, {"content": "There are no weddings or funerals.

None of them is the worst possible forecast, noted today Laurence Boone, chief economist at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), but they range from the \u201cbest\u201d \u2013 if the The new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (in the origin of Covid-19 disease)\u200b remains essentially contained in China and the known foci \u2013 or the more serious, if it spreads more globally. In the hypothesis of \u201cbest case\u201d, finished \u201cbeginning of last week\u201d, explained this morning Laurence Boone at a press conference, global economic growth takes a cut of 0.5% (or 200 billion dollars) to 2, 4% (compared to 2.9% in 2019, which was the same growth forecast for the organization, last November, for 2020). In this forecast framework, growth will be 3.3% in 2021 (a little above the 3.1% expected in November) said the chief economist of the OECD, estimating the organization that, in this view, all impacts will gradually start to dilute up early next year. A scenario that cuts world economic growth by 0.5% implies a 4% drop in domestic demand in China and Hong Kong in the first quarter of this year, to which is added another 2% in the second quarter. And globally, a 10% drop in markets and non-food raw materials in the first half of 2020, explains the OECD. In this reading, the growth of the euro zone will be 0.8%, remaining at 1.2% in 2021, down from the previous OECD forecast of 1.1%. The OECD forecasts get worse for France (grows 0.9% in 2020, compared to 1.3% in 2019 and compared to 1.2% forecast in November for this year) and Italy (0% stagnation compared to a growth of 0.2% in 2019 and a cut compared to the 0.4% that the OECD predicted four months ago). For Germany the forecast is 0.3% in 2020, compared to 0.6% in 2019. In November 2019, the OECD estimated that the German economy would grow 0.4% this year. In China, the forecast growth for 2020 is 4.9%, compared to 6.1% in 2019. Here, the forecast cut between November and today is 0.8 percentage points. In the most pessimistic scenario, with a \u201cdomino\u201d effect \u2013 being that \u201cthis is not the worst possible scenario\u201d, stressed this morning Laurence Boone, who bypassed all direct questions about the possibility of a potential recession in the short term, global or by countries \u2013 the impact on world GDP will be 1.5%. That is, recalled the chief economist of the OECD &quot;almost half of the economic growth [global] predicted [by the OECD] four months ago&quot;. At that time, as mentioned above, the forecast was that in 2020 global growth would be 2.9%. In this scenario, in addition to the forecast of a reduction in China&#39;s domestic demand, in the same order as the \u201cmore optimistic\u201d scenario, there is an extension to other regions: a decrease of \u201cmore than 2% in demand in most Asian countries -Pacific\u201d and in the more developed economies in the Northern hemisphere during the second quarter of this year, with a 20% drop in the capital market and in the price of non-food raw materials, along with \u201ca 50 basis point increase in the premium investment risk in all countries\u201d. The OECD is particularly concerned about the \u201cconfidence shock\u201d in world markets, reflected last week in major \u2013 if not all \u2013 markets in Asia, Europe and the US. And this, defended this Monday Laurence Boone, &quot;is not a shock that can only be faced by central banks&quot;. There is what, said the organization&#39;s chief economist: to deal with and increase confidence in the capital market. &quot;This is not a crisis that can be tackled by central banks, but by budgetary authorities.&quot; Governments \u201cmust act now to curb the advance of the [new] coronavirus, protect populations and businesses from its effects, and support economic demand,\u201d advises the organization.

The border between information and scaremongering, or on health issues is very tenuous and the appearance of a new coronavirus in China has once again put the media to the test. The debate among the readers of EL PA\u00cdS jumped since the first news was published three weeks ago. Since then, almost every day there is someone who criticizes the newspaper because he believes that it exaggerates the problem. Others think otherwise. The controversy does not end despite the fact that the newspaper itself has publicly called for caution and restraint. The problem of the new virus was identified on December 16 in a hospital in Wuhan (China), but Beijing did not inform the World Health Organization (WHO) until December 31. Ten days later, EL PA\u00cdS published on the web the first information with this headline: A virus similar to SARS, responsible for the mysterious pneumonia in China. The text indicated that there were 59 infected people, but no deaths. The comparison with SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which caused 774 deaths in 2002 and 2003, sparked the first criticisms. This was commented by a reader on the web: \u201cCome on, to alarm. 59 affected by pneumonia at most, zero deaths \u201d. Another replied: \u201cWell, it&#39;s to be alarmed. If the virus comes from an animal (as is believed), there is a serious public health problem that can cause an epidemic \u201d. It was the beginning of a debate that exploded when the newspaper began publishing the issue in its print edition on January 17. The headline on page 26 of that day was: WHO monitors the progress of the virus discovered in China and detected in two other countries. By then, the disease had claimed a fatality. And two more on the 20th, when the headline on the web was this: The deadly Wuhan virus spreads through China. Reader Pedro Bra\u00f1as told me by mail that he found him &quot;unacceptably alarmist.&quot; &quot;It doesn&#39;t strike me as a responsible headline for a serious newspaper.&quot; Seven days later, there were already 4,400 infected in about twenty countries - most in China, but the infection had already reached Europe - and the death toll exceeded one hundred. Even so, some readers maintained critical positions like these: &quot;This strange virus has all the media putting the population on emotional alert as if it were the epidemic at the end of the world&quot;; &quot;Scaremongering, you have to sell&quot;; &quot;This timely broadcast of each case only serves to transmit paranoia and scaremongering.&quot; Several readers wonder why the newspaper narrates this infection and not the serious effects of the flu. In the 2018-2019 season, CF recalls, the flu cost the lives of 6,300 people in Spain. Oriol G\u00fcell, health specialist and signatory of several information on the coronavirus, maintains that the newspaper is covering widely, but also with prudence, &quot;information of great scientific and medical relevance and, therefore, of undoubted interest for readers&quot; . Between 20 and 27, two news stories about the coronavirus were among the ten most read in the newspaper and on 30 was the most followed when the WHO declared the international alert. &quot;We do not know the magnitude that this epidemic will have and reporting its evolution day by day is an inescapable obligation of the media,&quot; says G\u00fcell. He adds that the common flu (such as tobacco, traffic or suicides) causes thousands of deaths a year, but &quot;they are already known phenomena&quot;, while the Wuhan coronavirus &quot;is something new with still unforeseeable consequences.&quot; To justify such coverage (fifty texts in 15 days), G\u00fcell recalls that the magnitudes of this infection are unprecedented: 10,000 infected in 25 countries (Spain included) and more than 200 deaths in a month, confinement of 56 million people in 13 Chinese cities, global stock market impacts, prevention measures in thousands of airplanes and airports, repatriations of foreigners ... Objective data support that the behavior of the newspaper has not been excessive. EL PA\u00cdS only addressed the issue when there was evidence of the seriousness of the case: on January 9 on the web and on January 17, on paper. Until the 21st, no calls appeared on the front page and the 24th was, for the first time, the main story on the front page with an informative, not alarmist headline: China isolates 21 million people to stop the spread of the virus. The newspaper even published an editorial on the 29th titled Weighting, in which it said: &quot;We must keep a close watch, but without falling into alarmism that could aggravate the damage inherent to an epidemic of this nature.&quot; As The Economist has noted, &quot;the world is better prepared than ever to stop the Wuhan coronavirus.&quot; This is so because the governments - the Chinese, the first - and the health authorities have learned from serious mistakes of the past.

SYDNEY (BLOOMBERG) - The global cost of the coronavirus could be three or four times that of the 2003 Sars outbreak that sapped the world's economy by US$40 billion (S$54.5 billion), according to the economist who calculated that figure. \n The sheer growth in the Chinese economy over the last 17 years means the global health emergency triggered by the coronavirus outbreak, which originated in Wuhan, has far greater potential to gouge global growth, according to Warwick McKibbin, professor of economics at the Australian National University in Canberra. \n \"It's just a mathematical thing,\" McKibbin said in a phone interview. \"Most of the GDP loss that we saw in the Sars model, and in reality, was China slowing down. And so, with China much bigger, you'd expect the billions would be much bigger.\" \n While difficult to pinpoint a precise cost as the crisis is still unfolding, the impact will be experienced mostly through changes in \"human psychology,\" he said. \"Panic is what seems to be the biggest drain on the economy, rather than deaths.\" \n Markets have been whipsawed by panic, Paris-based Amundi Asset Management said in a Jan 29 note. Chief investment officer Pascal Blanque and his deputy Vincent Mortier said the novel coronavirus provided the trigger for a pause in a stock market rally that began in October. \n McKibbin's forecasts are in line with those of other analysts. \n Nomura International expects the blow to China's growth could exceed that seen during the Sars outbreak. Real GDP growth in the first quarter could \"materially drop\" from the 6 per cent pace in the fourth quarter, maybe by even more than the 2 percentage point deceleration seen in the second quarter of 2003 from the first, Nomura economists led by Lu Ting wrote in a report to clients. \n Bloomberg economists Chang Shu, Jamie Rush and Tom Orlik, said: \"Back in 2003, China accounted for just 4 per cent of global GDP. Fast forward to 2020, and its share has increased to 17 per cent. That means the global spillover if China's growth slumps will be larger. \n \"Hong Kong stands out as the most exposed - our simulation shows a hit of 1.7 percentage points (ppt) in the first quarter. South Korea and Vietnam would also suffer, each slowing by 0.4 ppt. Japan would take a 0.2 ppt hit.\" \n More contagious than Sars but less deadly, the insidious nature of the coronavirus, dubbed 2019-nCoV, is such that it often presents as mild cold-like symptoms and can go undetected, which could potentially protract out the crisis for longer than the 2003 epidemic. \n The new virus, which emerged in central China in late 2019, is reported to have infected almost 10,000 people in two months, eclipsing the 8,096 Sars cases reported from November 2002 through 2003, when the contagion spread from China across South-east Asia and to North America and Europe. \n \"If a country had a bad epidemiological outcome, then their shocks were likely be a lot bigger than countries that were able to control it well,\" McKibbin said, referring to his findings from examining the impact of Sars."}, {"content": "Paris Live Monday 20 January 2020.

WASHINGTON - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week as employers continued to hold on to their workers, but the coronavirus pandemic is expected to lead to an increase in layoffs as companies battle supply chain disruptions and sagging demand for some goods and services.  \n Some businesses are already cutting jobs and demand is weakening, at least at the factory level. Other reports on Thursday showed companies announced more than 600 layoffs through March 12 tied to the outbreak, while producer prices fell by the most in five years in February as prices for energy products and services such as hotel accommodation, shipping and air travel dropped.  \n Financial markets are expecting the Federal Reserve will aggressively cut interest rates again at its policy meeting next week to counter the coronavirus, which investors fear is the catalyst that will derail the longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year.  \n \"It's just a matter of time before the fallout from the coronavirus starts to show up in increased layoff activity,\" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.  \n Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 211,000 for the week ended March 7, the Labor Department said. Jobless claims are the most timely labor market indicator. They have declined for two straight weeks.  \n Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 218,000 in the latest week.  \n The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 1,250 to 214,000 last week.  \n Unadjusted claims for Washington state, hardest hit by the virus, which causes a respiratory disease called COVID-19, rose modestly last week.  \n The World Health Organization on Wednesday termed the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. The virus with flu-like symptoms has killed at least 38 people in the United States and sickened more than 1,300. Overall, more than 4,700 people have died from COVID-19 and over 127,000 have been infected.  \n The Fed last week slashed its benchmark overnight interest rate by a half percentage point to a target range of 1.00% to 1.25%, in its first emergency rate cut since the financial crisis. Financial markets have fully priced in a rate reduction of as much as 75 basis points at the U.S. central bank's March 17-18 policy meeting.  \n Economists are predicting the Fed will reduce its benchmark overnight interest rate to zero by year-end, given low inflation expectations, underscored by a plunge in Treasury yields.  \n The dollar jumped against a basket of currencies after the European Central Bank announced more stimulus to fight the coronavirus but did not lower rates. Stocks on Wall Street continued to drop, with the Dow Jones Industrials index on course for its worst day since 1987 as investors took a dim view of President Donald Trump's decision to suspend travel from Europe. U.S. Treasury prices rose.  \n  \n WEAK PRODUCER PRICES  \n The disease originated in China, the main source of inputs used in factories, as well as goods consumed in the United States. While some Chinese factories have resumed operations after Beijing extended the Lunar New Year holidays in an effort to curb the spread of the virus, they are running below capacity. The coronavirus is hurting demand for transportation, especially air travel, as well as entertainment and recreation, and leisure and hospitality services.  \n Companies in the energy sector have also been affected as crude prices have tumbled, a decline that has been exacerbated by an oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. The United States is now a net exporter of oil and weak crude prices are likely to hurt capital expenditure and employment in the sector.  \n A separate report on Thursday from global placement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas showed as of the morning of March 12, employers had laid off 633 workers. Most of the job cuts were in the entertainment and leisure industry. Transportation, technology and energy sectors were not spared.  \n The trend could persist, with a third report from the Labor Department showing the producer price index for final demand dropped 0.6% last month, the biggest decline since January 2015, after surging 0.5% in January. In the 12 months through February, the PPI increased 1.3% after gaining 2.1% in January.  \n Economists had forecast the PPI dipping 0.1% in February and rising 1.8% on a year-on-year basis. While the coronavirus-driven bottlenecks in the supply chain could boost prices for inputs, that is likely to be offset by weak oil prices and falling demand for services.  \n In February, wholesale gasoline prices plummeted 6.5% after declining 1.5% in January. Gasoline accounted for nearly one-third of the 0.9% drop in the cost of goods last month. The decline in goods was the most since September 2015 and followed a 0.1% gain in January. Wholesale food prices fell 1.6%.  \n The cost of services dropped 0.3% in February after rebounding 0.7% in January.  \n There were decreases in the cost of airline tickets, water transportation of freight and hotel accommodation, which recorded its biggest decline since April 2009.  \n But the cost of healthcare services rose 0.2% last month after rising 0.6% in January. Portfolio management fees increased 0.3% after accelerating 2.3% in January. They could, however, take a hit from an ongoing sharp sell-off on Wall Street. Those healthcare and portfolio management costs feed into the Fed's preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index.  \n \"There are early signs in PPI that the coronavirus will weigh on various consumer prices significantly in coming months,\" said Veronica Clark, an economist at Citigroup in New York.

Overseas, over 300 cases of coronavirus have been reported, including from three from Kerala.\nMeanwhile, millions of people have started returning to Beijing and other cities in China after the extended holiday of China's New Year.\nThe holidays, which began on January 24 and were due to end on February 3, has been extended till February 9 as part of its efforts to contain the spread of the virus.\nHowever, the employees of most of the offices have been asked to work from home.\nAs the biggest reverse migration began, Chinese officials said on Saturday that the cases of the deadly infection had started declining for the first time after weeks of sharp rise.\nChina's new confirmed cases of novel coronavirus outside Hubei has been dropping for six consecutive days, according to the commission.\nA total of 444 new confirmed cases were reported on Sunday outside Hubei, the data showed.\nThe numbers of new confirmed cases in these provinces during the past days were 890 on Monday, 731 on Tuesday, 707 on Wednesday, 696 on Thursday, 558 on Friday and 509 on Saturday, the commission said.\nThe head of the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Saturday that the UN health agency would send an international mission to China as it received a response from Beijing.\nWHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the team leader would leave early next week with the rest of the experts to follow.\nThe UN health agency said the number of cases of the coronavirus in China was \"stabilising\", which is a \"good news\".\nIt, however, cautioned that it was too early to make any predictions about whether the virus might have peaked.\n\"There has been a stabilisation in the number of cases reported from Hubei,\" Michael Ryan, head of WHO's Health Emergencies Programme said at a briefing in Geneva.\n\"We're in a four-day stable period where the number of reported cases hasn't advanced. That's good news and may reflect the impact of the control measures that have been put in place,\" Ryan was quoted as saying.\nBut he added that it was \"very early to make any predictions\"."}, {"content": "Infrastructure completed five months before the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The organization of the Tokyo2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games announced this Friday that all infrastructure for the sporting events had been completed, about five months before the start. At the beginning of the year, the Aquatic Centre, which will host the swimming and the main aquatic competitions, remained to be completed, one of the most ambitious projects and which was delayed due to a controversy over the technical data of the anti-earthquake systems. The infrastructure for the Games will be inaugurated on March 22, with Tokyo2020 having 43 venues, including the Olympic Village, eight of new construction and which will be permanent, 25 that already existed and ten temporary. The completion of the construction of the venues takes place in a period of great uncertainty and speculation about the future of the Games, which should take place from July 24th to August 9th, due to the Covid-19 epidemic caused by a new coronavirus.

SINGAPORE \u2014 It has been just about a month since the first case of Covid-19 landed in Singapore, but Ms Patricia Zhuang has already had her pay cut by half, to just under S$1,000.\u00a0 \n The 37-year-old sales staff at Vivy Boutique, an apparel store at Novena Square, was converted from a full-time employee to a part-time staff as part of her company\u2019s cost-cutting measures.\u00a0 \n \u201cNow, I\u2019m only earning my pocket money,\u201d said Ms Zhuang.\u00a0 \n It\u2019s a similar story for Mr Rex Xu, a manager at Ker\u2019s Hair Salon, over at Jurong East.\u00a0 \n The decline in the number of customers at the hair salon has led to a drop in his commission, resulting in an overall 50 per cent dip in income, said the 32-year-old.\u00a0 \n \u201cIf this continues, we cannot survive. We need to eat and pay rent,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \n  Ms Patricia Zhuang, who works at a boutique at Novena Square. Photo: Raj Nadarajan/TODAY\u00a0 \n The novel coronavirus, now officially known as Covid-19, originated from the Chinese city of Wuhan and has now spread to 29 other countries and territories, with Singapore reporting 86 confirmed cases as of Friday (Feb 21).\u00a0 \n Not only has the virus infected close to 75,000 individuals globally and caused more than 2,000 deaths, mainly in China, it also left a trail of economic casualties.\u00a0 \n As the authorities in Singapore try to curb the spread of the virus through various measures, such as a travel ban on non-residents who have been to China recently, businesses in the retail and food and beverage (F&B) sectors have borne the brunt of the sharp drop in tourist arrivals and weak consumer spending among Singaporeans.\u00a0 \n The virus-related blow comes on the back of an already challenging retail environment, which has been buffeted by continuing US-China trade tensions and e-commerce competition.\u00a0 \n The plight of Ms Zhuang and Mr Xu was not uncommon among retail and F&B employees as TODAY went around eight different locations across the island this past week to find out how businesses in these sectors were coping with the economic fallout of the Covid-19 outbreak.\u00a0 \n On Monday, the Trade and Industry Ministry downgraded its 2020 full-year growth forecast for Singapore to between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent \u2014 with a possible recession \u2014 from an initial projection of between 0.5 per cent and 2.5 per cent.\u00a0 \n Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had earlier said that the Covid-19 situation already had a greater impact on the economy compared to when Singapore went through an outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) back in 2003, and would likely last longer.\u00a0 \n A \u2018PITIFUL\u2019 SIGHT\u00a0 \n With travel restrictions imposed on non-residents who have been to China in the last 14 days, it is unsurprising that tourist spots have been hit the hardest.\u00a0 \n At Chinatown, staff and business owners of several establishments told TODAY that sales had gone down by 80 per cent.\u00a0 \n \u201cBusiness has dropped so much that it\u2019s very quiet here, nobody at all during the night time\u2026 Everybody here is very worried, it\u2019s very pitiful,\u201d said Ms Kathy Fan, co-owner of Vietnamese restaurant Co Ba Quan, which is located along Chinatown\u2019s Food Street.\u00a0 \n When TODAY visited the street on a weekday afternoon, it was possible to see one end of the road from the other, lined with rows of empty tables. Tourists were few and far between, with some restaurants serving only one table of customers, or none at all.\u00a0 \n One elderly worker could be seen dozing off at an empty table. \n Earlier this week,\u00a0TODAY reported that some Chinese workers, businesses in Singapore \u2014 including those in Chinatown \u2014 are being shunned, amid discrimination faced by some Chinese nationals here.\u00a0The discrimination stems from anxiety over Covid-19, which originated in the city of Wuhan in China.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n  Empty tables at Chinatown, where the outbreak of the coronavirus has hit businesses hard. Photo: Nuria Ling/TODAY \n But the retail slump goes beyond that \u2014 consumers are also avoiding retailers and F&B outlets elsewhere.\u00a0 \n At Jewel Changi, sales staff said that business had gone down by as much as 70 per cent. Queues at fast-food outlets Shake Shack and A&W were also visibly shorter.\u00a0 \u00a0 \n And it is not just retail outlets at tourist spots that have been affected. Businesses in the heartlands from Simei to Jurong East also reported a slump in sales. \u00a0 \n Mr Kelvin Wai, owner of Evergreen Handphone Shop at Simei, said the travel restrictions had also affected his business as 20 per cent of his customers were Chinese tourists who bought mobile phone SIM cards. He has stopped ordering new stock with business down by 40 per cent.\u00a0 \n At The Digital Gadgets, a mobile phone accessory outlet at Westgate mall in Jurong East, its manager, Ms Serena Nguyen, said that her company was trying to push for more online sales via e-commerce websites as business had dropped by 50 per cent at the shop.\u00a0 \n Reports of confirmed Covid-19 cases at Marina Bay Financial Centre, as well as companies\u2019 directive for staff to work from home, have also turned the Marina Bay Link Mall into a \u201cghost town\u201d, said Ms Lyn Lee, founder of Awfully Chocolate.\u00a0 \n Sales of her two stores at the Marina Bay area have been particularly affected, she said.\u00a0 \n When TODAY visited Suntec City around noon on Thursday, there was a decent lunchtime crowd at the restaurants surrounding its iconic Fountain of Wealth. But those located further away were more than half empty.\u00a0 \n Mr Oscar Apiado, the outlet manager of apparel store The Shirt Bar, said that the mall corridors were \u201calmost empty\u201d after 3pm when the lunchtime crowd dwindled.\u00a0 \n At Japanese buffet restaurant Kuishin Bo, staff could be seen standing around, tending to only a handful of customers during the lunch hour. \n Its restaurant manager, Ms Chao Jun, said that the place would typically be three-quarters full during lunchtime, but it was not even a quarter-full when TODAY was there.\u00a0 \n SHORTER OPENING HOURS, STAFF ASKED TO TAKE NO-PAY LEAVE\u00a0 \n With sales dropping by 80 per cent, Ms Chao said staff had been asked to clear leave as there was no longer the need to have the usual manpower strength of five servers on a weekday.\u00a0 \n \u201cNow I only plan for two people to work. Even two people also got nothing to do\u2026 only standing there waiting for customers,\u201d she said. \n Even restaurants which open only for dinner are facing the same problem. Last Saturday, Mr Marjun de Claro, manager at the House of Peranakan at Outram Park, said that the restaurant did not have a single customer for the whole night.\u00a0 \n The \u201czero sales\u201d phenomenon is also happening at retail outlets. Ms Zhuang said that there were several days where the store did not manage one single transaction. There was one particular day where it made a total of S$15 in sales.\u00a0\u00a0 \n When TODAY visited apparel store Ns\u2019 Boutique at\u00a0Square 2 at 2pm on Wednesday, its director Ms Chrislyn Ng said the store had not managed a single sale since it opened at 10.30am.\u00a0\u00a0 \n With business down by 30 per cent, Mr Freddy Ng, operations manager of Wang Tian Kitchen at Outram Park, said that his restaurant is now closed on Saturdays. Operating hours on weekdays have also shortened by about two hours.\u00a0 \n Across the island, several business owners said they have started similar cost-cutting measures, such as reducing the number of part-time staff, or shortening the working hours of their full-time staff, inevitably affecting the income of these workers.\u00a0 \n Several workers also voiced fears about losing their jobs if their companies continue to be battered over the next few months.\u00a0 \n Ms Candy Chen, 47, a sales staff at Just Mobile, a mobile phone accessory store at Nex mall in Serangoon, said her commission had fallen by 30 per cent along with the drop in sales.\u00a0 \n All three employees of Mr Joe Chen, a director of two apparel stores at Novena Square, have been asked to take turns to go on no-pay leave. As a result, they end up\u00a0working only three to four days a week.\u00a0\u00a0 \n He has applied for them to go for skills upgrading courses on the days that they are not working.\u00a0 \n  Like other malls across the island, businesses at Novena Square\u00a0have\u00a0been\u00a0affected. Photo: Raj Nadarajan/TODAY\u00a0 \n CONSUMERS STAYING AT HOME\u00a0 \n With companies activating remote-working arrangements, and more individuals choosing to stay home because of the Covid-19 outbreak, it is not surprising that malls are seeing lower footfall, thus affecting the businesses of retailers and F&B outlets.\u00a0 \n For Ms Michelle Chin, 49, it is not just the malls she is avoiding. She has also stopped going to her church in Bukit Batok.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \u201cWhen (the virus crisis) first broke out, I said I didn\u2019t want to go church. My kids say, \u2018Ma, don\u2019t be paranoid\u2019. But it\u2019s my personal choice\u2026 It\u2019s just a precaution,\u201d said the retiree, who had stopped attending church service for the past three Sundays.\u00a0 \n Some churches and other religious institutions have cancelled or scaled back their regular religious services and holding them online instead, after two Covid-19 clusters were identified at churches. \n Before the outbreak, Ms Chin used to head to Novena Square at least once a day to buy her groceries, and patronised some of the shops in the mall now and then.\u00a0 \n That has all but stopped with the exception of a weekly grocery run.\u00a0 \n Even then, it is a real quick run. \u201cThe minute I get into the mall, I get to the escalator, buy whatever I need and run back,\u201d said Ms Chin.\u00a0 \n While work-from-home arrangements naturally mean that F&B establishments in office areas would see a smaller lunch-time crowd, it does not automatically translate to increased sales at outlets in residential estates.\u00a0 \n To reduce the risk of exposure to the virus, Ms Doreen Yeow started working from home whenever possible even before her workplace made it official.\u00a0 \n Her lunch now consists of home-cooked food, as the 38-year-old engineer has stopped going to crowded places, such as malls.\u00a0 \n \u201cI don\u2019t step out of the house at all,\u201d she said. She only left home twice in the past week, once to visit her parents and another time to attend a class.\u00a0 \n Mr Sean Wei Leong, a 32-year-old risk manager, who also started working from home last week, said he generally avoids crowded areas, such as Orchard Road, although he does head to the suburban malls in Tampines where he lives.\u00a0 \n SOME LANDLORDS EXTEND A HELPING HAND\u00a0 \n Amid mounting calls for help from the retail and F&B sectors due to the Covid-19 outbreak, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat on Tuesday unveiled two special packages totalling S$5.6 billion to help firms and workers, as well as households during his Budget speech. \n The packages dwarf the S$230 million package introduced during the Sars crisis in 2003, and significantly exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations of at least a S$500 million package.\u00a0 \n Part of the S$5.6 billion package is a S$4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package (SSP) meant for businesses and workers affected by the Covid-19 outbreak.\u00a0 \n The SSP includes:\u00a0 \n \u00a0A S$1.3 billion Jobs Support Scheme where the Government will pay for 8 per cent of the wages of local employees, up to a monthly cap of S$3,600, for three months. \n \u00a0Flexible rental payments for tenants and lessees under the JTC Corporation, Housing and Development Board (HDB), Singapore Land Authority, Singapore Tourism Board and Sentosa Development Corporation. \n A waiver of one full-month of rent for tenants at National Environment Agency-managed hawker centres and markets. \n A half-month rent waiver for tenants under government agencies, such as HDB.\u00a0 \n A 15 per cent property tax rebate for Changi Airport and commercial properties. \n \u201cI strongly urge landlords to pass this on to their tenants by reducing rentals,\u201d Mr Heng had said. \n Several property developers, such as CapitaLand, GuocoLand, AsiaMalls and Frasers Property, have said that they will pass on the full savings of the tax rebates to their tenants, in response to TODAY\u2019s queries.\u00a0 \n Marketing campaigns and free parking for visitors, among other initiatives, have also been introduced by some developers to help their struggling tenants. \u00a0 \n At Suntec City, for example, tenants facing liquidity issues can tap a recently set up S$5 million fund which provides \u201cshort term, low-cost borrowing and quick access to funds for working capital\u201d, said Mr Anthony Yip, deputy chairman of APM Property Management, Suntec City's property manager. \n BUSINESSES SAY THEY NEED MORE HELP\u00a0\u00a0 \n On the Budget measures, several businesses told TODAY that they would have preferred more direct help on rental rebates \u2014 such as how Jewel Changi is offering a 50 per cent rebate on rent for its F&B tenants for the months of February and March \u2014 instead of leaving it to the landlords\u2019 discretion whether to pass on savings from tax rebates to them.\u00a0 \n \u201cSavings from the tax rebates are nothing to me\u2026 We are talking about occupancy costs (being) as high as 70 to 80 per cent (out of tenants\u2019 total costs) now,\u201d said Mr R Dhinakaran, president of the Singapore Retailers Association (SRA).\u00a0\u00a0 \n If developers do not provide a direct rebate on rent, a potential consequence would be the closures of several retailers, causing the malls to be empty, he noted.\u00a0 \n \u201cWhat can (the developers) do? They can\u2019t sue everybody who can\u2019t pay rent\u2026 (Retailers) will just pull down the shutters and go away\u2026 That\u2019s a situation, I hope, will not happen,\u201d Mr Dhinakaran said. \n Instead, a \u201cfair approach\u201d during these challenging times would be to pay the landlord a certain percentage of the tenants\u2019 sales as rent, he suggested.\u00a0 \n  Some establishments\u00a0at Jewel Changi Airport have\u00a0seen a 70 per cent fall in business amid\u00a0the Covid-19 crisis.\u200b Photo: Raj Nadarajan/TODAY \n Mr Vincent Tan, president of the Restaurant Association of Singapore (RAS), echoed Mr Dhinakaran\u2019s sentiments, adding that passing on savings from a tax rebate is \u201cway below\u201d what the association is asking for.\u00a0 \n \u201cIn fact, the 15 per cent rebate (announced during Budget) comes from the Government. The developers (are not going to) sacrifice a single cent,\u201d Mr Tan said.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Last week, RAS told the media that it had sent letters to 24 landlords, requesting that they offer rental rebates of up to 50 per cent for February, March and April.\u00a0 \n Awfully Chocolate\u2019s Ms Lee said there was \u201clittle\u201d offered in the Budget that would help retailers directly and materially. Recalling how property tax rebates were also part of the Sars relief package back in 2003, she said that landlords then were reluctant to pass on the savings to their tenants. \n \u201cIt felt as if a great amount of cajoling had to be done before help was given\u2026 Is the same thing going to happen? I can only assume so\u2026 So if the Government\u2019s intention is that these tax rebates are passed down to the tenants, then I think they should be given with a set of parameters and directives. Not left to goodwill and best endeavours,\u201d she added. \n Passing on the savings of a tax rebate may also not be as timely as compared to a direct rebate, said Wang Tian Kitchen's Mr Ng.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \u201cIf for now, I keep paying the same rent, so at the end of the year, the landlord say, \u2018I rebate you 15 per cent\u2019. What\u2019s the point? It won\u2019t help already. The thing is already over by then,\u201d he said. \n Some businesses said they were disappointed that unlike the 2003 Sars relief package,\u00a0 the foreign worker levies were not reduced this time.\u00a0 \n While Ms Chris Lim, a business partner at children edutainment provider Diggersite, said she knows that the Government\u2019s intention is to encourage companies to hire more locals, her hands, unfortunately, are tied.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \u201cOur situation is different. The jobs we have, the locals will not take... (The Government) thinks we should hire locals, but it\u2019s actually not our call,\u201d said Ms Lim, whose business includes a cafe at Suntec City.\u00a0 \n As her company provides edutainment at company events and conducts field trips for children, she has had to temporarily suspend these weekday services, as the Government has discouraged large-scale public gatherings with the raising of the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (Dorscon) risk assessment level from Yellow to Orange.\u00a0 \n As for Mr Wai, who is renting a space from HDB for his mobile phone accessories shop in Simei, he lamented that the half-month waiver for rental is \u201cvery little\u201d and not of much help.\u00a0 \n However, he said he was looking forward to the possibility of setting up flexible arrangements to pay rent, such as through an instalment plan.\u00a0 \n A STRUGGLE TO HANG ON\u00a0 \n With no end in sight to the Covid-19 outbreak yet, and consumers continuing to shun the malls and eateries, businesses are worried about the prospect of closures should the situation drag on longer than expected.\u00a0 \n Mr Heng has repeatedly assured businesses and households that the Government is watching the situation closely, and it will not hesitate to do more if needed.\u00a0 \n Mr Chen, the apparel store director, said that he has an emergency fund that would be able to tide him through this crisis for the next six months, at most.\u00a0 \n \u201cIf worst comes to worst, if after six months and we\u2019re still making losses, then we may have to close one of our stores. Instead of two, we would just run one,\u201d he added.\u00a0 \n Other businesses gave a shorter time frame.\u00a0 \n For example, Diggersite\u2019s Ms Lim said she may have to take more drastic measures, such as retrenching full-time staff, if things do not improve in three months.\u00a0 \n Mr Shah Iskandar, owner of South Asian eatery Az Zumar at Outram Park, said he would assess the situation in a month\u2019s time. \u00a0 \n \u201cIf the problem goes beyond end of March, finances will be very tight for us,\u201d he said. He might have to cut short his eatery\u2019s operating hours, which is currently open for 24 hours daily to just 12.\u00a0 \n That would also mean cutting the number of staff required to sustain the operations, he added.\u00a0 \n Mr Dhinakaran said most retailers would probably be able to hold the fort for only the next two to three months, if things do not get better or if the landlords do not provide substantial rebates in rent.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \u201cSuppliers will also chase for money. You have stock in the shop but not sold, doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t chase\u2026 You have to pay this, pay that, but no sales, how do you pay? Then everybody will put up their hands and say, \u2018Sorry cannot pay\u2019. That\u2019s what will happen,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \n RAS\u2019 Mr Tan said most F&B outlets would be able to sustain business under current conditions for the next three to six months.\u00a0 \n Professor Lawrence Loh, from the National University of Singapore Business School, called on major developers \u2014 the ones with the \u201cdeep pockets\u201d\u2014 to \u201cdemonstrate their social responsibility\u201d and help retailers and F&B outlets struggling to cope with the crisis.\u00a0 \n He pointed out that the economy this time would not undergo a V-shaped recovery, unlike what happened after Singapore eradicated Sars in July 2003.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \u201cIt would be more like a flat U-shaped recovery\u2026 For this Covid-19 outbreak, it\u2019s expected to be longer. It will simmer on, in dribs and drabs... There will be a persistent effect on retail. And even after the outbreak is officially declared to be over, business will not just recover overnight,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \n In the meantime, for service staff like Ms Zhuang and Mr Xu, they would need to tighten their belts and watch their spending \u2014 setting off a spiral of reduced consumption which would further hit retailers and eateries.\u00a0 \n \u201cRight now, having a job is not bad already,\u201d said Mr Xu. \n CORRECTION: An earlier version of the article stated that\u00a0Ns\u2019 Boutique\u00a0was located at Novena Square. This is incorrect. It is located at Square 2. We are sorry for the error.\u00a0"}, {"content": "Wuhan virus: China confirms human-to-human transmission, says medical workers infected. BEIJING - China\u2019s health commission said on Monday (Jan 20)\u00a0 that medical workers have been infected by the deadly coronavirus\u00a0first discovered in the central city of Wuhan, confirming it can be transmitted between people. \n \u201cThe current situation is that it is no longer animal to human transmission, but human to human,\u201d said Chinese pulmonologist Zhong Nanshan, who discovered the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars)\u00a0coronavirus in 2003 and now heads an expert panel under the health commission. \n He cited a case in Guangdong, where the patient had not been to Wuhan but caught the virus from a family member.

Questioned by journalists during a meeting in the Oval Office with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, Trump also said that he reserves the option of extending travel restrictions for more than 30 days or reducing this period &quot;if the problems end&quot; related to the new coronavirus. &quot;It&#39;s possible (that it extends it more than 30 days), and it&#39;s also possible that we cancel it ahead of schedule,&quot; he said.

LONDON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - The new coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China, in December has infected tens of thousands of people in China and beyond and triggered alarm around the world. (here) Here is what we know about the disease it causes and how it spreads:\n* Like other coronaviruses, the new virus - which causes a disease now called COVID-19 - is transmitted from person to person via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes. It can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles or railings.\n* Scientists in China who studied swabs from infected patients say the new coronavirus behaves quite like flu viruses, suggesting it may spread more easily than previously thought.\n* COVID-19 infection has an incubation period of between one and 14 days, and a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association has found new evidence that the virus can be spread asymptomatically.\n* A World Health Organization-led team of investigating scientists in China has said that the epidemic there peaked between Jan. 23 and Feb. 2 and has been declining steadily since then.\n* They also found that the case-fatality rate is between 2% and 4% in Wuhan and 0.7% outside Wuhan.\n* Infectious disease and virus specialists estimate that each infected person in the epidemic is infecting, on average, two to three other people.\n* The WHO said on Monday that the COVID-19 outbreak was not out of control globally and does not have a large-scale death toll, so it was \u201ctoo early\u201d to speak of a pandemic.\n* Coronavirus infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, coughing, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Mild cases can cause cold-like symptoms, while severe cases can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory illness, kidney failure and death.\n* Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that get their name from what they look like under a microscope - they are spherical and their surfaces are covered with \u201ccrown\u201d-like spikes.\n* Animal viruses can mutate or combine with other viruses to create new strains capable of being passed to people. Scientists say the new coronavirus originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via an intermediary animal species.\n* Genetic data suggests the new coronavirus is the result of viral recombination - a process where more than one virus infects the same cell at the same time and creates a \u201crecombinant\u201d virus strain."}, {"content": "covid-19 outbreak expected to last longer than sars and cause greater economic impact, life has to go on: pm lee.

Don't just act on a knee jerk, based on somebody's headline,\u2019\u201d said Mr Lee. \n When asked about more clusters emerging, PM Lee said that this does not yet constitute widespread community transmission as most of these cases are still traceable to a particular source. \n \u201cSo we will have to watch the trend,\u00a0 how the trend goes, whether the numbers go up and also whether the cases are traceable and we can continue to do contact tracing and then squeeze out the clusters one by one,\u201d he said. \n During Mr Lee\u2019s visit at Changi Airport, he also met taxi drivers who were willing to ferry healthcare workers and gave them a care package consisting of hand sanitisers and disinfectant wipes.\u00a0 \n Separately on Friday, he also penned a Valentine\u2019s Day note to all healthcare workers on the frontline.\u00a0 \n Posting a photo of his handwritten card on Facebook, he thanked them for looking after patients \u201cday after day\u201d. \n \"Your loving care and commitment makes all the difference.

Henk Bekedam, the WHO Representative to India, was quoted as saying that the \"commitment of the Indian government from the top level has been enormous, and very impressive\".\nAt the very first level -- unlike China, which long remained in denial mode -- the Indian government was quick enough to activate its health management system and issue necessary travel advisories. Many state governments followed suit, leading to the early detection and isolation of infected patients.\nMoreover, the state machinery -- led by the Ministry of Health and other related agencies -- were prompt enough to issue 'valid precautionary guidelines' to keep the public well-informed and prepared.\nThe monitoring of the coronavirus outbreak at the PMO level has backed this process. Well-coordinated action plans include careful airport checking, active health laboratories and the quick establishment of quarantine facilities across the country. The strategy of the government has been to stick to the prevention is better than cure\u2019 model.\nMore importantly, the Indian government has also been applauded globally for safely flying back many of its citizens -- especially workers and students stuck abroad in the mainland China and other coronavirus-affected countries, speaking volumes about the government\u2019s concern and efforts for its citizens.\nIn addition, Indian efforts have remained completely aligned to guidelines from the WHO, which has been monitoring the crisis since it began and advocating the aggressive testing, tracking and isolation of as many Covid-19 (the disease caused by the novel coronavirus) cases as possible.\nTo sum it up, managing a new virus outbreak is never a easy task for any state, but the way the Indian emergency response system has been activated holds lessons for the other countries in the future.\nAbhishek Pratap Singh has a PhD in China Studies from JNU and teaches at the Deshbandhu College, University of Delhi.

In more severe cases, the infection can lead to lung inflammation, acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.\u00a0COVID-19 BACKGROUNDAccording to the WHO website, its China country office was informed of cases of pneumonia that were detected in Wuhan on Dec 31, 2019.\u00a0On Jan 7, the Chinese authorities confirmed that the novel coronavirus can be transmitted from human to human.Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-COV).A study of the virus' genetic sequence suggested similarities to that seen in snakes and bats.China health officials identified the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan as the source of the transmission of the coronavirus.Besides Malaysia, COVID-19 has spread to Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, Vietnam, Germany, United States, France, Macau, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom,\u00a0Canada, Italy, Russia, Spain, Finland, Cambodia, Sweden, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Belgium.On Jan 30, WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak as a global emergency. By then, it had spread to 18 countries and caused 170 deaths.The declaration was aimed at preventing or reducing transmissions across borders.With 1,489 deaths worldwide as of today, COVID-19 has overtaken SARS which caused 774 deaths in 2003.\u00a0Translated by Rema NambiarBERNAMA\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0"}, {"content": "China reports new virus cases, raising concern globally before key holiday.

The border of Hubei province, epicenter of the virus, opened on Wednesday after a two-month shutdown.\nBut there are concerns that the end of the lockdown will release thousands of infectious people back into circulation.\nAsymptomatic cases present a huge challenge in the control of infectious disease, making it harder to detect and stop transmission.\nIn China, the number of known asymptomatic cases is classified, and it is not included in the official data, though the South China Morning Post, citing unpublished official documents, recently said it was more than 40,000.\nChina had reported 81,218 coronavirus cases, and 3,281 deaths by the end of Tuesday.\nAsymptomatic cases are currently found through \u201ccontact tracing\u201d.

But it remains unclear how many asymptomatic cases remain undiagnosed and therefore unquarantined.\nSome experts warn that undetected, asymptomatic patients could create fresh transmission routes once lockdowns are eased.\n\u201cIt is especially concerning given that many countries have yet to implement sufficient levels of widespread community testing,\u201d said Adam Kamradt-Scott, a public health specialist at the University of Sydney.\nIt is also unclear how much they might infect others.\n\u201cWe know that that is possible, but we do not believe that that\u2019s a major driver of transmission,\u201d said Maria Van Kerkhove of the World Health Organization at a briefing early in March.\nNew studies show that asymptomatic carriers could pose risks. One analysis of the Diamond Princess cruise ship outbreak showed that 33 of the 104 infected passengers remained asymptomatic even after an average of 10 days of observation at the Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital in Japan.\nWhile many appeared healthy throughout, a few other initially asymptomatic passengers quickly became seriously ill.\nAnother study published on March 23, looking at cases in the southwestern Chinese city of Chongqing, said 18% of patients were asymptomatic. Another even found that people are more likely to transmit the disease when symptoms are at their mildest.\nThe Yale School of Public Health said the existence of presymptomatic (asymptomatic) patients meant that screening procedures at airports and other points of entry were insufficient to prevent the coronavirus passing from China to other countries.\n\u201cThe real picture will only come to light when we have a serological test to find out who has been infected,\u201d said Ian Henderson, Director of the Institute for Molecular Bioscience at Queensland University."}, {"content": "China&#39;s GP postponed due to the outbreak of the new coronavirus.

However, the International Automobile Federation (FIA) and Formula 1 have agreed to postpone the race for safety reasons. &quot;As a result of current health concerns, and with the World Health Organization [WHO] declaring coronavirus a global health emergency, the FIA \u200b\u200band Formula 1 have adopted these measures,&quot; explained the entities in a statement quoted by Reuters. \u201cAll parties will take the necessary time to study the feasibility of possible alternative dates for the Grand Prix at the end of the year, should the situation improve\u201d, they add. However, Formula 1 chief executive Chase Carey underlines that, although all hypotheses are being evaluated, it will be difficult to find a date for the race, as this year&#39;s calendar is practically complete. &quot;Right now it&#39;s difficult to make many concrete plans when there are so many unknowns,&quot; Carey told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference in Baku (Azerbaijan)\u200b. He subscribes to newsletters for free and receive the best of current affairs and the most in-depth works from P\u00fablico. Chase Carey also revealed that Formula 1 will pay attention to the spread of the virus outside China, particularly with regard to Vietnam, which is expected to host its first race on April 5th. This Wednesday, the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona was also canceled due to the outbreak. In 33 years of history, this is the first time that the organization has canceled the large mobile phone fair, after dozens of companies have withdrawn due to fears associated with the virus and travel restrictions. According to the latest WHO balance sheet, the new coronavirus has already caused more than 1100 deaths, almost all in China, and more than 45,000 infected."}, {"content": "The colors of resistance in Hong Kong. From a distance it may look like everything is back to normal. \u201cBut nothing is normal anymore,\u201d he says. Not at all. The protests in Hong Kong, whose pictures of burning barricades and beating policemen went around the world in the past six months, have become quieter - and less common. They are not gone, they have just shifted. Kelvin prefers not to give his real name. It is the end of January, the last evening of the Chinese New Year celebrations, and the 22-year-old is on his way to see relatives. The telephone connection is scratchy. \u201cI&#39;m on the subway,\u201d Kelvin says dully, as if through cotton wool. He&#39;s wearing a mask again. But not a heavy one, against tear gas, but a light one - against the corona virus, which has found its way to Hong Kong. The day before, the Prime Minister Carrie Lam declared a state of emergency. The local Disneyland is closing, photos show empty and deserted public spaces, there will be no demonstrations for the time being. However, companies, doctors and nurses are threatening to strike on Monday if the government does not agree to completely seal off Hong Kong for visitors from mainland China. End of the New Year holidays The students in the city should have returned to class on Monday after the end of the New Year holidays. On Friday, however, Lam announced that the schools would be closed until March due to the risk of infection. &quot;The city is in a panic,&quot; says Kelvin. Nothing is normal anymore. But that&#39;s not the point for him now. 2020 everything will be different, the Hong Kong administration chief Matthew Cheung had promised in December. Kelvin laughs bitterly. He has not trusted politics for a long time. About once a week he went to demonstrate last, says Kelvin. And of course there are always brutal scenes, the police are still violent. But the real protest no longer takes place on the street, but on an economic level. In the past few months something has developed that the protesters call the \u201cyellow economy\u201d. In an ever-growing type of online registry, shops, restaurants, even gyms are labeled either yellow or blue. Yellow means: democracy-friendly. Blue: Beijing-friendly. \u201cI&#39;m rigorous,\u201d says Kelvin, \u201cI don&#39;t spend a penny on those who face the protests in cold blood.\u201d It works quite well, he says, the blue shops are getting their first problems. It is the collateral damage of a revolution that ordinary employees can also be hit - their contracts are terminated. It was said to have happened. Important financial and trading center This cannot be verified in detail. But it seems clear that Hong Kong&#39;s economy - after all, an important financial and trading center for China - has suffered from the protests. Prime Minister Carrie Lam is constantly warning of bad numbers. But if this should frighten the demonstrators, it won&#39;t work. If economic pressure on the Beijing government doesn&#39;t work, what then? Kelvin says: \u201cHow you spend your money is like casting a vote in an election.\u201d At the same time, it is a low-threshold form of protest. Everyone can join in without putting themselves in danger. Consumption has long since become political. It fits with this protest movement that the next dynamic strategy developed out of the depths of its creative masses. \u201cBe water, my friend\u201d - this quote from Bruce Lee had been the motto of the demonstrators in Hong Kong for half a year. In early June 2019, hundreds of thousands took to the streets for the first time to protest a change in the law that would allow suspects and criminals to be easily extradited to China. Kelvin was there - even when Hong Kong police officers cracked down on demonstrators for the first time on June 12th. It was an early turning point, after which the initially peaceful protest changed radically. Both sides were arming: the police with more tear gas, rubber bullets, water cannons and clubs; the mostly young protesters with Molotov cocktails and professional equipment. Streets became battlefields, weekly. Hard judgments Kelvin works in a law firm during the week. As an assistant, he takes care of cases of young demonstrators who are to be convicted of gun possession. He spent hours looking at surveillance camera footage to be able to say exactly what happened when and how in an argument with the police. He says he&#39;s happy to be able to do this work, even if it&#39;s not always fair. Because some judges hastened proceedings so that they could convict people quickly; because when in doubt, many always opted for the harder judgment. \u201cLast week,\u201d he says, \u201ca 23-year-old was sentenced to twelve months in prison for helping a protester carry Molotov cocktails.\u201d Reuters recently wrote of around 7,000 people arrested during the seven-month protests . According to police chief Chris Tang, 1,092 of these were convicted. Most of those arrested from June 9 to November 14, 2019 were between 21 and 25 years old, according to Reuters, and the majority of them are male. Half a year of protests not only divided the city into two parts: supporters and opponents of Beijing, but also tore families apart. The conflict is also one between generations, the youth think yellow, the grandparents blue. Fear of Persecution This is the case with 23-year-old Dawn, for example. She also does not give her real name for fear of persecution. For months she has been avoiding confrontations with relatives who are loyal to the Chinese state. Like her over-80-year-old grandfather. Only relatives from the mainland managed to talk him out of his travel plans for the New Year celebrations. By then, he believed the Communist Party was in control of the coronavirus outbreak. She also visited her family for the New Year. Because the relatives ordered the food from a blue restaurant, they also ordered from a yellow one. The scandal did not materialize - because, for once, everyone was talking about the corona virus and not about politics. She regularly sends parents lists of \u201callowed\u201d shops. Sometimes, she says, they stuck to it. For them, as well as for Kelvin, there is no question about it. \u201cI&#39;ve gotten into the habit of checking before I go into a shop.\u201d The yellow ones can also be recognized without the app, she says and laughs: at the queues in front of the doors! Dawn sends links to the apps she uses via Whatsapp. The city maps are covered with yellow, blue and some red dots - attention: mainland capital! A McDonald&#39;s in the Pok Fu Lam district is marked in blue, a window with reasons opens after a click. Including those: On August 25, 2019, vouchers were issued to police officers there. Meat Pie Gor restaurant in Tai Wai is yellow. The owners have sided with the demonstrators. Or Sogno Gelato, the famous ice cream shop in a shopping mall in Tsuen Wan that doesn&#39;t serve police officers; who sold his own creation at the end of the year as a form of protest, tear gas flavor - with black pepper. On the Lennon Wall, the standards according to which the shops are rated is a constant discussion in the Hong Kong swarm intelligence community. Did the owner speak out in favor of the government? Are the entrepreneurs demonstrably pro-Beijing? It has not been so easy to be part of a revolution for a long time if that just means buying the coffee in the right caf\u00e9. Dawn tells of people who were beaten up by police officers when they stuck colorful post-its with wishes and demands on the so-called Lennon walls that were being built on buildings, underpasses and shop facades all over Hong Kong. It had already existed in 2014, with the umbrella movement. Their role model is in Prague, where a wall has been painted with graffiti and slogans as an expression of the protest against the communist regime since the 1960s. &quot;We don&#39;t know what can happen to us if we express our opinions publicly,&quot; says Dawn. \u201cIn the yellow economy we can feel free and safe.\u201d Dawn worked as a social worker until mid-January. Night after night she was on the way to meet homeless youths, runaways and drug addicts. The more intense the protests became, the more often she and her team with minivans also served as revolutionary taxis. They quickly brought the young demonstrators out of the danger zone or home when at some point after 10 p.m. there was no more subway. What she experienced and saw did not leave her untouched. She had panic attacks and could no longer sleep. She still has stomach problems today. Dawn&#39;s work was not without risk, and at the height of the protests, the Hong Kong police also arrested first aiders and social workers. Vacation in Australia Before she looks for a new job, she will travel: two weeks in Australia in February. She will accompany friends, nurses who see their vacation as a research stay. They want to find out if they could imagine life in Australia. Dawn wants that a little too. \u201cIn all honesty,\u201d she says, \u201cI don&#39;t want to have any children here, because I couldn&#39;t guarantee them a good life, no democracy, no freedom and not the opportunity to do what they want.\u201d Your friend thinks the same way. \u201cRationally, we believe that emigration is best for us. We just can&#39;t make it emotionally. \u201dFor Kelvin, too, emigrating is a realistic option. On the weekends he is studying again for his studies in order to have the best possible opportunities in another country with an early graduation. His parents, who think \u201cyellow\u201d like him, are considering moving to Taiwan. Until then, the daily protest will be part of her life. &quot;We are waiting for the right moment to overwhelm the Chinese government,&quot; says Kelvin. &quot;We are ready to go back on the road at any time.&quot;"}, {"content": "hsa appeals for blood donors as stock dips to low or critical levels during covid-19 outbreak. SINGAPORE \u2014 With Singapore\u2019s blood banks closely watching the screening of donors during the coronavirus outbreak, the authorities are appealing for healthy donors to give blood because stocks have dipped to low or critical levels. \n In response to TODAY\u2019s enquiries on Friday (Feb 14), the Health Sciences Authority (HSA), which manages Singapore\u2019s blood banks, said: \u201cOur blood stocks are currently trending downwards. We, therefore, strongly urge donors who are healthy and eligible to step forward as our patients really need your support during this challenging period.\u201d \n With extra precautions in place, such as stringent screening of donors before they are allowed into the blood banks, HSA said that the risk of contracting the novel coronavirus, Covid-19, while giving blood is assessed to be low. \n The Singapore Red Cross said on its website that on Friday, stocks for the A+, B+, O+ and AB+ blood types were at \u201ccritical\u201d levels, and those for the A-, B-, O- and AB- blood types were \u201clow\u201d. \n When blood stocks are at the critical level, this means that donors are urgently needed and urged to donate on the same day. \n For blood types where stocks are low, donors are urged to donate within the week. \n HSA said that blood is needed every day to support the needs of patients in Singapore, and that it was important to maintain at least six days of blood stock at all times for daily transfusion needs and bleeding emergencies. \n Last year, there were 75,655 blood donors, or just 1.87 per cent of the resident population. \n NO EVIDENCE CORONAVIRUS CAN SPREAD THROUGH BLOOD \n For now, there is no evidence that Covid-19 can be transmitted through blood, HSA said. \n Even so, the authority has put in place a slew of measures to ensure the safety of the blood supply and the health of its donors. \n Since last Friday \u2014 when Singapore raised its disease outbreak response code to Orange \u2014 HSA has been screening potential donors and their companions for fever or respiratory symptoms, such as cough or runny nose, and their travels to mainland China, before they can enter the blood banks or mobile donation drives.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Those who are unwell, on leave of absence or have been to China in the last 14 days will be barred entry. \n Apart from beefing up the screening of donors, HSA said that staff members were monitoring their temperatures twice daily, and have been told to wear masks and see a doctor if they have fever or respiratory symptoms. \n \u201cTo further assure our donors, we have also increased the frequency of cleaning to ensure the cleanliness standards of our blood banks,\u201d HSA added. \n INFECTED DONORS TO BE DEFERRED \n As for donors who have Covid-19 infection, their donations will be deferred until more information becomes available, HSA said. \n \u201cThey will only be allowed to donate blood when there is more medical data to indicate when it is safe for donors who have recovered from the novel coronavirus infection to donate blood again,\u201d it added. \n Blood donors told TODAY that they would continue to give blood, although one donor is concerned about visiting the blood banks. \n Undergraduate Tan Hui Lin, 24, who last donated blood in 2018, said that the blood banks are in areas where people tend to congregate. \n HSA\u2019s four blood banks are in Outram, Dhoby Ghaut, Woodlands and Jurong East. \n \u201cMost of us would avoid crowded places\u2026 there\u2019s high inertia to actually leave the house,\u201d Ms Tan said, although she added that she would donate blood if the supply is low. \n Mr Shahroull Khairoullah, 29, a painting company owner who gives blood every three months, said that he would not do so for now because he has been coughing for the past few weeks. \n Business development manager Chan Si Yong, 27, said that HSA\u2019s added precautions were helpful, even though screening procedures were already stringent before the virus outbreak. \n Donors have to fill in a health questionnaire and be checked by a medical screener, he said. \u201cIf you are unwell, they will turn you down.\u201d \n Public servant Andrew Wilfred, 33, said that the coronavirus outbreak would not deter him from donating blood. \n \u201cI trust that the nurses are doing their best to maintain the high standards of hygiene that they have always done.\u201d \n For information on where to go for blood donation and the blood banks' opening hours, go to HSA's website\u00a0or the Singapore Red Cross' website."}, {"content": "Association ensures that gyms &quot;are prepared&quot; for a coronavirus outbreak.

The more physical exercise we do, the greater the capacity we have to resist any type of infection, viral or bacterial,&quot; stated the president of the Portuguese gymnasium association in statements to the Lusa agency. According to Jos\u00e9 Carlos Reis, the association drew up and sent to all clubs a contingency plan with measures to be adopted to contain the spread of the virus: &quot;The gyms are prepared.

Among the measures provided for in the plan sent to gyms are the provision of disinfectants in the exercise rooms, the posting of information on hygiene care in all places, a &quot;more frequent and systematic&quot; cleaning of objects such as taps, handles and doors, counters or handrails, and the definition of an area of \u200b\u200bthe club where people with symptoms of Covid-19 should be referred.

SINGAPORE \u2014 A person\u2019s physical and mental health get messed up on a regular basis when he or she travels frequently for work, and the latest coronavirus epidemic is not helping matters presently. \n Mental health issues are predicted to be one of the top 10 risks that business travellers will face this year. This is based on the latest Travel Risks Outlook 2020 report by global travel risk management company International SOS. \n Yet, these issues remain an overlooked aspect of business travel, especially in today\u2019s hypermobile work climate. \n Dr Low Kiang Wei, medical director of International SOS, said that not only does business travel take a toll on physical health, it also affects individuals on a psychological level due to factors such as time spent apart from loved ones, blurred lines between work and after-work hours, and anxiety due to unexpected increases in workload. \n Navigating travel risks such as natural disasters or epidemics can add on to the stress. \n Infectious diseases outbreaks are also one of the risks highlighted in International SOS\u2019 report. \n So far, health officials in China have confirmed more than 31,000 cases of the new coronavirus, with more than 4,800 of them considered severe. The disease, which causes pneumonia in its severe form, has claimed the lives of more than 630 people in China. \n The virus, also known as 2019-nCov, has also sickened more than 200 people in at least 20 countries. In Singapore, two patients who are warded are under intensive care. \n Dr Low said of the anxiety that travellers face: \u201cWithout appropriate pre-trip awareness, risk mitigation advice, access to 24/7 assistance in case of emergencies such as natural disasters or epidemics, business travellers can also feel unnecessarily stressed about their own safety.\u201d \n Even with the appropriate preparations, an evolving and escalating situation such as the current coronavirus epidemic can considerably increase a traveller\u2019s stress, he added. \n \u201cThere is an element of the unknown and situations can change quickly. \n \u201cIn these circumstances, it is important to provide access to timely, accurate, verified information. Travellers and assignees can also feel increasingly isolated and vulnerable,\u201d Dr Low said. \n Dr Edwin Ong, resident doctor at DTAP Clinic in Siglap, said that stress and anxiety levels can rise when faced with the increased possibility of close contact and exposure to infected travellers, especially when heading to countries that have confirmed the presence of the virus. \n \u201cBusiness travellers may feel that they are putting their health and well-being at risk by having to travel during this unsafe period, and this could weigh down tremendously on their overall mental health,\u201d he said. \n WHAT BUSINESS CLIENTS ARE ASKING \n Ms Wynne Wee, vice-president of Asia Pacific at Workplace Options, which provides employee wellbeing solutions, said that her team has received \u201ca significant number\u201d of requests from companies, partners and individuals in the Asia-Pacific region seeking support during this period. \n However, she added it is too soon to ascertain if the increase in calls is specifically due to the coronavirus outbreak. \n Ms Wee said that clients in the management level who ask for support are concerned about how they can support their teams sensitively in these times while maintaining healthy business outcomes. \n Ms Wee, who is a trained counselling psychologist, said: \u201cAs with everyone else, the same fears (about the new coronavirus) holds true for business travellers, but we can imagine how this fear may be elevated for those who are still required to continue with essential business travel. \n \u201cOn the other hand, if they\u2019re told that travel is put off, this will also have an impact on how one feels about their job security which leads to different concerns.\u201d \n WHAT ONE BUSINESS TRAVELLER IS DOING \n For one frequent flier from Singapore, Ms Syahidah Y, she has greater freedom as the founder of makeup brand Molly Cosmetics to adjust her business travel plans. \n With no obvious end in sight to the outbreak, she has made a self-imposed \u201csemi travel ban\u201d and will limit her business travels to just Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia and Myanmar. \n Otherwise, she also usually flies to China, Hong Kong, Japan and Taiwan\u00a0for work at least twice a month. \n Her hectic business travel schedules often leave her feeling weary and fatigued.\u00a0 \n \u201cWork travel is not as glamorous as people make it out to be,\u201d she said. \n \u201cSure, there are the comforts of travelling in business (class) or staying in fancy hotels, but in reality, the need to be in \u2018work mode\u2019 once you get off the plane, constantly be on your toes and be expected to perform your best for work activities \u2014 these affect you mentally.\u201d \n It can also get lonely, she added. \u201cThere\u2019s limited time in a day. After dealing with work during your travel, you don\u2019t have much time to \u2018enjoy\u2019.\u201d\u00a0 \n HOW WORK TRAVEL MESSES WITH THE MIND \n Dr Ong of DTAP clinic said that the mind and body are interdependent, and neither aspect of health should be ignored. \n \u201cOften times, a much stronger emphasis is placed on physical health instead, such as sleep interruptions from jet lag, unhealthy eating and drinking and lack of exercise. \n \u201cHowever, if left undiagnosed and untreated, mental health issues can fester and worsen in severity, which in turn lead to the very same physical health issues that we are trying to avoid.\u201d \n For instance, long distance or frequent travel affects the body\u2019s natural circadian rhythm, which is responsible for regulating sleep patterns. \n Poor or little sleep\u00a0in turn\u00a0causes increased levels of the stress hormone cortisol, which can lead to the development or\u00a0worsening of mental illness such as depression or anxiety, Dr Ong said. \n In a separate 2018 study, commissioned by the International SOS Foundation, stress, depression, emotional exhaustion and heightened anxiety were reported in a large proportion of international business travellers. \n Almost half, or 45 per cent, of the respondents, reported an increase in stress levels. About a quarter reported heightened depression (27 per cent) and heightened anxiety (23 per cent). \n About 31 per cent experienced emotional exhaustion \u2014 a core feature of burnout \u2014 on a weekly basis, while 41 per cent reported that their mood suffers during business trips, Dr Low said. \n Dr Ong warned that unaddressed mental health issues as a result of work travel can create a ripple effect on other aspects of the person\u2019s life, such as work performance, relationships and social life. \n There are consequences on a larger scale, too. \n HOW IT AFFECTS BUSINESS COSTS \n \u201cMedical claims for mental and physical health issues lead to increased costs for employers. Reduced work performance, absence from work and short-term disability can result in decreased revenue,\u201d Dr Ong said. \n Yet, Dr Low pointed out that only 15 per cent of organisations surveyed in market research company\u00a0Ipsos Mori\u2019s Business Resilience Trends 2020 include mental health issues in their travel policies. \n He said: \u201cThis figure is worrying, given that there are increasing studies and accounts of business travellers suffering from mental health issues. \n \u201cBusiness travel is likely to continue in the coming year, and it is important for businesses to build a holistic and preventive culture of health to protect the wellbeing of their workforce.\u201d\u00a0 \n WHAT COMPANIES CAN DO \n Dr Low said that efforts to address mental health in the workplace need to begin at the C-suite, or management level, and trickle down to the frontline employee. \n International SOS, for example, has in place a range of employee mental health initiatives. It includes the use of an assistance mobile application for employees to receive updates on destination risks as well as briefings on their travel destination, if required from the medical and security teams. \n This has been especially useful in the current coronavirus outbreak situation. \n \u201cTravellers are able to \u2018check in\u2019 (via the app) to let their employer know where they are, and to allow monitoring of travel patterns. It also allows tailored advice based on their travel to be proactively pushed out,\u201d Dr Low said. \n \u201cFor example, a traveller can be alerted to review or change their routing based on alerts or messages being pushed out. \n \u201cManagers can also review daily travel patterns to proactively push out information to their staff. As this (2019-nCov) crisis has evolved, so has our health information \u2014 it\u2019s key that travellers have access to the very latest guidance to help allay their concerns.\u201d \n  Having updated and useful\u00a0information at hand can help take away some of the anxiety that travellers have.\u00a0Photo: Media Raw Stock \n From this month onwards, International SOS employees in Singapore will also be able to dial in to a helpline for professional counselling or talk about their emotional concerns. This phone service, done in partnership with Workplace Options, is now in operation in its China and Europe offices. \n Workplace Options recommends that all companies assess their employee\u2019s fitness and suitability for business travel before giving out work travel assignments. \n Ms Wee said: \u201cNot everyone is cut out for business travel, which can take a huge toll on (a person\u2019s mental health). Having the right fitness, mindset and resilience is important to ensure wellbeing and effective outcomes of business travel.\u201d \n Dr Low said other practices that organisations can put in place to protect their employees\u2019 mental health include: \n 1. Having mental health monitoring aside from physical health checks before and after travels \n Ensure that any post-trip feedback surveys include not just logistics, but feedback on mental health and psychological experience. \n 2. Build an organisational restitution culture \n Encourage business travellers to build rest and recovery into their schedule while on the trip and after returning. Enable flexible work schedules for recovery; this may include working from home or taking prolonged weekends. \n 3. Consider adding employee assistance programmes \n This may include 24/7 access to at least telephonic emotional support, and wellness programmes. \n 4. Make the trips as seamless as possible \n For instance, if they encounter a health or medical issue while overseas and late at night, do they know who to easily call or visit for immediate help?"}, {"content": "Coronavirus pandemic: How the world has dealt with Covid-19, could it have done better?. It looks like a world war against a virus. The novel coronavirus which has acquired pandemic scale both in its spread and declaration by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Now, for the first time, the rest of the world has more coronavirus cases than China, the source region.\nThe total number of Covid-19 patients in the world has crossed 1.67 lakh with China accounting for less than 82,000, according to WHO's latest report. While the world reported 13,903 cases in preceding 24 hours. Only 29 of these were reported from China.\nThe WHO has already declared Europe as the new epicentre of coronavirus pandemic. Incidentally, it was only after the theatre of pandemic shifted from oriental landscape to Europe that the more dominant powers appeared serious in tackling the contagion. Here is an account of how the world has dealt with coronavirus pandemic.\nINSULATION\nThe United States has suspended all flights from Europe. President Donald Trump is expected to declare national emergency. Many European countries such as Germany, France and Britain have followed a similar strategy to insulate themselves. This method has worked for many less developed countries such as Magnolia, which is surrounded by China from three sides, North Korea, located like cheese between the slices of South Korea and China, two of the worst affected countries in the world.\nIndia too imposed massive travel restrictions. India began screening of passengers coming to India in the final week of February. The vigil was up not only at airports but also at the sea ports. The government said more than 27,000 people were not allowed to land in India at sea ports as the paths of the ships had crossed coronavirus affected countries.\nIn nut shell, country-quantine is the most preferred method adopted by various governments to check spread of Covid-19.\nCovid-19 is a pandemic both in its scale of spread and by the declaration of the WHO. However, it is peculiar that there has not been attempts by leading countries to devise a common and coordinated strategy to fight the contagion.\nChina called for international cooperation in early February. The WHO too called for a concerted global effort. But all countries ultimately devised their own specific strategy to deal with coronavirus spread.\nWhen the Donald Trump administration suspended flight operations from Europe, the decision was criticised for having been unilateral in nature. Italy, Iran and other worse affected countries felt constrained in dealing with the crisis leading to sudden spike in the cases of Covid-19.\nIndia, however, showed some initiative recently with Prime Minister Narendra Modi hosting a video-conference with the leaders of the Saarc. Decision was taken to create a Saarc fund to fight coronavirus spread. Such attempts taken in the initial days might have kept the novel coronavirus in check to a large extent.\nAnother tactic reportedly adopted by some countries was of underreporting and covering up the coronavirus outbreak. It began with China.\nFor first two months -- now the first victims of novel coronavirus have been traced back to November 2019 against previously set starting point of mid-December 2019 -- China refused to acknowledge the Covid-19 outbreak.\nThe doctor who first went public with the reporting of coronavirus outbreak was severely reprimanded by the Chinese government. The first health workers alerting the officials and asking people to beware of this contagion were also reportedly warned for \"rumour mongering\".\nLater, that doctor died. Chinese media said he died of Covid-19. This all happened despite Chinese President Xi Jinping telling the public that anyone found hiding the truth would be severely dealt with. Recently, an old aide of Xi Jinping went missing after he criticised the Chinese government for its handling of coronavirus pandemic.\nA pattern of cover-up was also seen in Italy and Iran, the two worst affected countries outside the source zone in China-Hong Kong-South Korea. Italian authorities are said to have dismissed the reports of coronavirus in initial days. They responded only after the situation spiralled out of control. The health infrastructure was found to be inadequate in the country. Same has been the case with Iran, which has already been reeling under the impact of multiple sanctions.\nIn India, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi alleged that the Modi government was in stupor as coronavirus caused havoc in the country. This was an allegation of cover up. Though, the government has been coming out with daily updates on the matter. The government has said that it is on the top of coronavirus situation in the country.\nCoronavirus pandemic has challenged the human capital of the world. In equal measure if not more is the pressure that the governments are feeling over their economic capital. The full scale economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic is still unknowns but economic boosters are already being announced.\nThe US Federal Reserve has cut down the interest rate to zero, and announced a mega $700 billion quantitative easing programme as the economy reels under the coronavirus pressure.\nThe UK has slashed interest rates on loans for small and medium businesses. Germany has announced tax cuts. Australia has announced to pump billions of dollars in its market to avoid coronavirus-induced slowdown.\nItaly announced a $28 billion dollar package to strengthen its health infrastructure. The European Commission followed the similar suit. Iran, for the first time in nealy six decades asked for money from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\nIn India, the Reserve Bank of India has decided to infuse Rs 1 lakh crore in the market to fight off adverse impact of coronavirus pandemic on Indian businesses. The RBI has not altered the regular banking duties but asked the customers to do more digital transactions to avoid contact with bank employees and keep less pressure on the banking staff."}, {"content": "Flip it over. The outbreak of the new coronavirus epidemic caught China&#39;s top leaders by surprise, on an inspection tour of several provinces. The alert inevitably altered his agenda and that of millions of Chinese who were preparing to enjoy their most precious holidays. The pneumonia outbreak is still in the early stage and concerns about its evolution are understandable. In the new Year of the Rat, will the new coronavirus become a kind of mousetrap for the Communist Party of China (CCP)? The CCP has taken over the reins of the crisis. First it was the central political and legal affairs commission, guarding Party and Government officials against the temptation to hide the seriousness of the situation. After the SARS crisis of 2003, it has been understood that opacity constitutes a major mistake that only exacerbates the problem. Timely, accurate, and transparent information appears to have become the norm in this case. Later, the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau issued the slogan of the control of the new coronavirus as the highest priority over any other matter. To the public health challenge of facing a crisis of these proportions in a country, despite everything, in the process of development, with a death toll approaching one hundred and thousands of people affected, the CCP is equally challenged political. Preserving social stability remains a priority. The bewilderment of the first moment was followed by criticism for the slowness of the initial reaction. The authorities have been prompt and relentless in taking unprecedented and energetic measures, and this has silenced them. At least for now. Without hesitation, the CCP tightens its muscles to demonstrate its invincibility. Far from being daunted, the slogan aims to turn the crisis around, turning it into a palpable demonstration of its ability to face the most serious challenges, whatever they may be. A message addressed both to Chinese society and to the rest of the world, even in the scientific order, with an exhibition of ability and competence to find quick answers, perhaps impossible in another time. China still cannot be compared to the West on many parameters, but the West would like to have its ability to juggle a crisis of these proportions, suggests Xi Jinping. That conviction inspires the CCP&#39;s behavior in these difficult hours, an invocation of that nationalism that closes ranks but cannot ignore that this is the second time it has happened. There cannot be a third. This is a very important year for the CCP. In 2021 it will celebrate the first centenary of its foundation. I wanted to present to the world a country in the state of a magazine. His highest aspiration is to proclaim from the rooftops that he has managed to make China a prosperous and wealthy society, a country respected in the world. But a lot will depend on how you get out of this.

The Wuhan coronavirus epidemic increasingly threatens to become a new friction element - one more - in the complicated relations between the United States and China. Beijing has made clear its unease about the way Washington has reacted to the biggest catastrophe in the Asian country in years. Measures such as the suspension of flights or a ban on travelers from China only serve, according to the government of President Xi Jinping, to &quot;create and spread fear.&quot; It is the second time, in just three days, that Beijing has made clear its irritation at what it considers an overreaction by the first power. This Monday, in a press conference offered through the internet -as part of the measures to avoid crowds and prevent contagion-, the spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Hua Chunying, accused Washington that, in addition to giving the gun exit to a global race to close borders and air traffic, &quot;has not yet offered any substantial help to the Chinese side.&quot; The epidemic is still far from being under control in China. The deceased already total 425, more than the 348 that SARS left in this country in 2003. The infected are already more than 19,000, of which at least 2,296 are in serious condition, according to the figures released early Tuesday. And it is going to have lasting consequences. This Monday, the National Reform and Development Commission, the all-powerful body in charge of economic planning in China, acknowledged that it will have a serious negative effect on the country&#39;s economy, especially in the consumer sector. In its reopening after the lunar New Year, the stock market crash despite the Central Bank&#39;s promise of an injection of liquidity for 154,000 million euros to alleviate the effect of the epidemic served as an advance: the main indicator of the Shanghai Stock Exchange , the SSE, fell more than 7.7%, the biggest drop since 2015, while the second Chinese stock, Shenzhen, lost 8.41%. But signs of hope are beginning to appear in the official data, which Beijing and Chinese citizens cling to and which the state media spread with enthusiasm. The number of recovered, 477 according to the numbers of the National Health Commission, has exceeded that of the deceased since this weekend. The cases of contagion outside Hubei, the province focus of the epidemic, have also decreased for two days, a possible indication that the drastic measures imposed by the central government against the spread of the virus are beginning to take effect. Those &quot;green shoots&quot; fuel Beijing&#39;s anger at how the United States has responded, too hastily from his point of view. The trade and technology war, on hiatus after the signing of a first-phase agreement in December, convinced the Xi government that a new \u201ccold war\u201d has begun, in which Washington&#39;s ultimate goal is to prevent the rise of China. . Beijing now interprets the US behavior in this epidemic as yet another attempt to try to weaken it. The White House responds that his behavior is due to public health reasons. \u201cIn a globalized world, the destinations of all countries are closely linked. Faced with a public health crisis, countries should collaborate to overcome difficulties instead of resorting to impoverishing their neighbors, much less taking advantage of the difficulties of others \u201d, Hua has attacked. Over the weekend, the spokeswoman had already stated in a statement that Washington&#39;s actions &quot;are not a gesture of goodwill.&quot; The United States, which has confirmed nine infections on its soil, was the first country to announce that it would repatriate its nationals trapped in Wuhan, the origin of the epidemic, after that city of eleven million inhabitants imposed a sudden quarantine on the 23rd. that blocked all their access. So far it has evacuated about 200 citizens, most of them consular officials, and hopes to organize a second rescue operation. Since this Sunday, and after declaring a &quot;public health emergency&quot;, its borders are closed to any foreigner without family ties with citizens or permanent residents of the United States and who has been in China in the two weeks prior to their arrival (fourteen days is maximum incubation time). In addition, US airlines have also temporarily suspended their flights, at least until the end of March. US President Donald Trump has stated in an interview with the Fox News television network that &quot;we have offered tremendous help (to China), we are the best in the world for that. But we cannot have thousands of people entering that could have this problem, the coronavirus. \u201d\u201c Basically, we have closed so that it does not enter from China. \u201dThe White House has also regretted that Beijing has not accepted, so far, its offer to send public health specialists from its Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Beyond reproaches, the coronavirus may have other effects on the relationship between China and the United States, experts warn. The economic impact of the crisis and the attention it demands from Chinese leaders may complicate Beijing to honor its commitments to steep increases in its imports of agricultural, energy and manufacturing products from the US \u201cTravel restrictions and border closures co At least they will weigh down the logistics to meet those objectives, &quot;says analyst Michael Hirson, from the Eurasia Group consultancy, in a note.

Migrant workers who hold green cards and get negative nucleic acid testing results will be sent out of the province to their workplace directly.\nOn January 23, Wuhan declared unprecedented traffic restrictions, including suspending the city's public transport and all outbound flights and trains, in an attempt to contain the epidemic within its territory. Similar restrictions were soon introduced in other areas in Hubei.\nLocal officials announced plans to gradually ease the severe measures as the virus cases dropped dramatically in recent days.\nHubei, however saw seven new deaths on Monday, all of which were in Wuhan, bringing the total number of deaths in the province to 3,160.\nThe province still has 4,200 patients being treated in hospitals of which 1,203 were still in severe condition and another 336 in critical condition, according to China's National Health Commission.\nHubei has so far reported a total of 67,801 confirmed Covid-19 cases, including 50,006 in Wuhan reflecting on the intensity with which the vicious virus, reportedly emerged from a local live animal market in the city shook the province.\nOn Tuesday, the NHC reported 78 new confirmed cases, including 74 imported infections taking their total to 427.\nThe overall confirmed cases on the Chinese mainland has reached 81,171 by the end of Monday.

Premium travel has suffered after many business events were cancelled across Asia because of the virus. \n Hong Kong-based rival Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd has said it is cutting 40 per cent of capacity across its network, up from 30 per cent earlier, due to weak demand.

The Chinese President, Xi Jinping, assured this Tuesday to the World Health Organization (WHO) that China does not intend to hide the &quot;demon&quot; of the outbreak of the new coronavirus that has already caused more than a hundred deaths in that country. &quot;The outbreak is a demon. We will not allow this demon to remain hidden,&quot; declared the Chinese head of state during a meeting in Beijing with the director general of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, according to the public station CCTV. The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was detected at the end of the year in the city of Wuhan, capital of Hubei province (central China), which has 11 million inhabitants. In the most recent official report of the outbreak, China confirmed 106 dead and more than 4,000 infected. The previous balance pointed to 80 dead and more than 2,700 infected. &quot;From the beginning, the Chinese government has shown openness, transparency and responsibility to release information about the outbreak as quickly as possible,&quot; said Xi Jinping. Xi Jinping&#39;s statements come at a time when many Chinese have denounced a belated reaction by authorities to the new coronavirus, but have also launched criticisms of media behavior. When the first cases of infection emerged, the Chinese &#39;media&#39; accused internet users of spreading &quot;rumors&quot; about a then potential outbreak. When the WHO decreed, between 2002 and 2003, the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which was also detected in Chinese territory, the international organization strongly criticized Beijing for having taken too long to give the alert and for having tried to hide the extent of the problem. SARS has killed 774 people worldwide, 648 of them on Chinese territory. Chinese authorities, who have already admitted that the ability to spread the new virus has been strengthened, have decreed drastic restrictions on travel across the country to try to contain the spread of the outbreak, as well as announced the record-time construction of hospitals in Wuhan and a reinforcement of 6,000 physicians to the coronavirus epicenter province. Alongside these measures, which according to international agencies reveal a change in attitude on the part of Chinese authorities when compared to the SARS crisis, the city of Wuhan has been quarantined and isolated from the world since last Thursday. On the WHO side, and regarding the meeting between Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and Xi Jinping, the spokesman for the international organization, Christian Lindmeier, said in Geneva that the two officials had analyzed the possible withdrawal of foreign citizens from Chinese cities, namely from Wuhan, a scenario that is being considered by several countries, including Portugal. The two representatives also analyzed the measures to be taken to prevent these repatriations from contributing to the spread of the virus. Still on the visit of Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to Beijing, the spokesman said that the director general of WHO also held meetings with the Chinese ministers of Health and Foreign Affairs, Ma Xiaowei and Wang Yi, respectively. At the press conference in Geneva, Christian Lindmeier underlined that the rapid increase in cases of infection does not, at this time, raise reasons to reconvene the WHO emergency committee to assess a possible declaration of international emergency. &quot;Three criteria are needed: that it is an extraordinary event, that poses a risk of rapid expansion in other countries and that requires a coordinated international response&quot;, explained Christian Lindmeier, indicating that, despite not having been issued a global alert, there is already a coordinated response around the world. In addition to the mainland of China, cases of new coronavirus infection have also been reported in Macau, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, United States, Singapore, Vietnam, Nepal, Malaysia, France, Germany, Australia and Canada ."}, {"content": "China's symptom-free coronavirus carriers raise fears of new wave of infections. SHANGHAI (REUTERS) - The existence of a substantial but unknown number of asymptomatic carriers of coronavirus in China has raised concerns among the public that people could still be spreading Covid-19 without knowing they are sick. \n As the virus continues to wreak havoc across the world, China is close to declaring victory and is already easing travel restrictions. \n The border of Hubei province, epicentre of the virus, opened on Wednesday (March 25) after a two-month shutdown. \n But there are concerns that the end of the lockdown will release thousands of infectious people back into circulation. \n Asymptomatic cases present a huge challenge in the control of infectious diseases, making it harder to detect and stop transmission. \n In China, the number of known asymptomatic cases is classified, and it is not included in the official data, though the South China Morning Post, citing unpublished official documents, recently said it was more than 40,000. \n China had reported 81,218 coronavirus cases, and 3,281 deaths by the end of Tuesday. \n Asymptomatic cases are currently found through \"contact tracing\". China identifies people exposed to someone with a confirmed diagnosis, and if they test positive, they are quarantined whether or not they manifest symptoms. \n \"Asymptomatic patients have all been discovered during our contact tracing,\" said Dr Wu Zunyou of the China Centre for Disease Control and Prevention at a briefing on Tuesday. \n \"So will they be able to create transmission? They won't.\" \n Still, the failure to include them in the official data has raised concerns about Beijing's commitment to transparency, and some experts say it could also create a misleading picture about how the epidemic spreads and whether or not it is under control. \n Despite recording zero new infections from last Wednesday to Sunday, the Covid-19 hot spot city of Wuhan disclosed last Friday\u00a0that one newly diagnosed case was not included in the official data because the patient, a 62-year-old man surnamed Zhang, had shown no symptoms. \n Citing hospital sources, the news magazine Caixin also reported that a new case in Wuhan on Tuesday was a doctor who had been infected by an asymptomatic patient. \n China says asymptomatic patients will be added to the list of confirmed patients if they show symptoms at a later stage. \n But it remains unclear how many asymptomatic cases remain undiagnosed and therefore unquarantined. \n Some experts warn that undetected, asymptomatic patients could create fresh transmission routes once lockdowns are eased. \n \"It is especially concerning given that many countries have yet to implement sufficient levels of widespread community testing,\" said Mr Adam Kamradt-Scott, a public health specialist at the University of Sydney. \n It is also unclear how much they might infect others. \n \"We know that that is possible, but we do not believe that that's a major driver of transmission,\" said Dr Maria Van Kerkhove of the World Health Organisation at a briefing early in March. \n New studies show that asymptomatic carriers could pose risks. One analysis of the Diamond Princess cruise ship outbreak showed that 33 of the 104 infected passengers remained asymptomatic even after an average of 10 days of observation at the Self-Defence Forces Central Hospital in Japan. \n While many appeared healthy throughout, a few other initially asymptomatic passengers quickly became seriously ill. \n Another study published on Monday, looking at cases in the south-western Chinese city of Chongqing, said 18 per cent of patients were asymptomatic. \n Another even found that people are more likely to transmit the disease when symptoms are at their mildest. \n The Yale School of Public Health said the existence of pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic\u00a0patients meant that screening procedures at airports and other points of entry were insufficient to prevent the coronavirus passing from China to other countries. \n \"The real picture will only come to light when we have a serological test to find out who has been infected,\" said Dr Ian Henderson, director of the Institute for Molecular Bioscience at Queensland University."}, {"content": "Oil prices rise more than 1%, on course for weekly gain.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Several months before the coronavirus pandemic began, the Trump administration eliminated a key American public health position in Beijing intended to help detect disease outbreaks in China, Reuters has learned.\nThe American disease expert, a medical epidemiologist embedded in China\u2019s disease control agency, left her post in July, according to four sources with knowledge of the issue. The first cases of the new coronavirus may have emerged as early as November, and as cases exploded, the Trump administration in February chastised China for censoring information about the outbreak and keeping U.S. experts from entering the country to help.\n\u201cIt was heartbreaking to watch,\u201d said Bao-Ping Zhu, a Chinese American who served in that role, which was funded by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between 2007 and 2011. \u201cIf someone had been there, public health officials and governments across the world could have moved much faster.\u201d\nZhu and the other sources said the American expert, Dr. Linda Quick, was a trainer of Chinese field epidemiologists who were deployed to the epicenter of outbreaks to help track, investigate and contain diseases.\nAs an American CDC employee, they said, Quick was in an ideal position to be the eyes and ears on the ground for the United States and other countries on the coronavirus outbreak, and might have alerted them to the growing threat weeks earlier.\nNo other foreign disease experts were embedded to lead the program after Quick left in July, according to the sources. Zhu said an embedded expert can often get word of outbreaks early, after forming close relationships with Chinese counterparts.\nZhu and the other sources said Quick could have provided real-time information to U.S. and other officials around the world during the first weeks of the outbreak, when they said the Chinese government tamped down on the release of information and provided erroneous assessments.\nQuick left amid a bitter U.S. trade dispute with China when she learned her federally funded post, officially known as resident adviser to the U.S. Field Epidemiology Training Program in China, would be discontinued as of September, the sources said. The U.S. CDC said it first learned of a \u201ccluster of 27 cases of pneumonia\u201d of unexplained origin in Wuhan, China, on Dec. 31.\nSince then, the outbreak of the disease known as COVID-19 has spread rapidly worldwide, killing more than 13,600 people, infecting more than 317,000. The epidemic has overwhelmed healthcare systems in some countries, including Italy, and threatens to do so in the United States and elsewhere.\nDuring a press briefing on Sunday shortly after this story was first published, President Donald Trump dismissed the Reuters report as similar to other stories regarding the CDC that he described as \u201c100 percent wrong,\u201d without addressing whether the role had been eliminated.\nU.S. CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield maintained the agency\u2019s presence in China \u201cis actually being augmented as we speak,\u201d without elaborating.\nIn a statement to Reuters before the report was published, the CDC said the elimination of the adviser position did not hinder Washington\u2019s ability to get information and \u201chad absolutely nothing to do with CDC not learning of cases in China earlier.\u201d\nThe agency said its decision not to have a resident adviser \u201cstarted well before last summer and was due to China\u2019s excellent technical capability and maturity of the program.\u201d\nThe CDC said it has assigned two of its Chinese employees as \u201cmentors\u201d to help with the training program. The agency did not respond to questions about the mentors\u2019 specific role or expertise.\nThe CDC would not make Quick, who still works for the agency, available for comment.\nAsked for comment on Chinese transparency and responsiveness to the outbreak, China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs referred Reuters to remarks by spokesman Geng Shuang on Friday. Geng said the country \u201chas adopted the strictest, most comprehensive, and most thorough prevention and control measures in an open, transparent, and responsible manner, and informed the (World Health Organization) and relevant countries and regions of the latest situation in a timely manner.\u201d\nOne disease expert told Reuters he was skeptical that the U.S. resident adviser would have been able to get earlier or better information to the Trump administration, given the Chinese government\u2019s suppression of information.\n\u201cIn the end, based on circumstances in China, it probably wouldn\u2019t have made a big difference,\u201d Scott McNabb, who was a CDC epidemiologist for 20 years and is now a research professor at Emory University. \u201cThe problem was how the Chinese handled it. What should have changed was the Chinese should have acknowledged it earlier and didn\u2019t.\u201d\nAlex Azar, secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) said on Friday that his agency learned of the coronavirus in early January, based on Redfield\u2019s conversations with \u201cChinese colleagues.\u201d\nRedfield learned that \u201cthis looks to be a novel coronavirus\u201d from Dr. Gao Fu, the head of the China CDC, according to an HHS administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \u201cDr. Redfield always talked to Dr. Gao,\u201d the official said.\nHHS and CDC did not make Azar or Redfield available for comment.\nZhu and other sources said U.S. leaders should not have been relying on the China CDC director for alerts and updates. In general, they said, officials in China downplayed the severity of the outbreak in the early weeks and did not acknowledge evidence of person-to-person transmission until Jan. 20.\nAfter the epidemic exploded and China had imposed strict quarantines, Trump administration officials complained that the Chinese had censored information about the outbreak and that the United States had been unable to get American disease experts into the country to help contain the spread.\nAzar told CNN on Feb. 14 that he and CDC director Redfield officially offered to send a CDC team into China on Jan. 6 but still had not received permission for them to enter the country. HHS oversees the CDC.\n\u201cDr. Redfield and I made the offer on January 6th - 36 days ago, 60,000 cases and 1,300 deaths ago,\u201d Azar said. \u201cWe made the offer to send the CDC experts in to assist their Chinese colleagues to get to the bottom of key scientific questions like, how transmissible is this disease? What is the severity? What is the incubation period and can there be asymptomatic transmission?\u201d\nDays later, the World Health Organization secured permission to send a team that included two U.S. experts. The team visited between Feb. 16th and 24th. By then, China had reported more than 75,000 cases.\nOn Feb. 25, the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak at home, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused China of mishandling the epidemic through its \u201ccensorship\u201d of medical professionals and media.\nRelations between the two countries have deteriorated since then, as Trump has labeled the coronavirus the \u201cChinese virus\u201d - a description the Chinese have condemned as stigmatizing. Last week, the Chinese government announced that Americans from three U.S. news organizations, The New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, would be expelled from China.\nThe decision to eliminate Quick\u2019s job came as the CDC has scaled back the number of U.S. staffers in China over the last two years, the sources told Reuters.\n\u201cWe had already withdrawn many technical public health experts,\u201d the same expert said.\nThe CDC, however, disputed that staffing was a problem or that its information had been limited by the move. \u201cIt was not the staffing shortage that limited our ability\u201d it said.\nThe U.S. CDC team in Beijing now includes three American citizens in permanent roles, an additional American who is temporary and around 10 Chinese nationals, the agency said. Of the Americans, one is an influenza expert with expertise in respiratory disease. COVID-19 is not influenza, though it can cause severe respiratory illness.\nThe CDC team, aside from Quick, was housed at U.S. Embassy facilities. No American CDC staffer besides Quick was embedded with China\u2019s disease control agency, the sources said.\nChina in recent weeks has reported a dramatic slowdown in new cases, the result of drastic containment measures including the lockdown of Hubei province, home to 60 million people.\nNevertheless, the infectious disease experts who spoke with Reuters said, the United States could use people like Quick with contacts on the ground, especially if fears of a second wave of infections materializes.\nThomas R. Frieden, a former director of the CDC, said that if the U.S. resident adviser had still been in China, \u201cit is possible that we would know more today about how this coronavirus is spreading and what works best to stop it.\u201d\nDr. George Conway, a medical epidemiologist who knows Quick and had served as resident advisor between 2012 and 2015, said funding for the position had been tenuous for years because of a perennial debate among U.S health officials over whether China should be paying for funding its own training program.\nYet since the training program was launched in 2001, the sources familiar with it say, it has not only strengthened the ranks of Chinese epidemiologists in the field, but also fostered collegial relationships between public health officials in the two countries.\n\u201cWe go there as credentialed diplomats and return home as close colleagues and often as friends,\u201d Conway said.\nIn 2007, Dr. Robert Fontaine, a CDC epidemiologist  and one of the longest serving U.S. officials in the adviser\u2019s position, received China\u2019s highest honor for outstanding contributions to public health due to his contribution as a foreigner in helping to detect and investigate clusters of pneumonia of unknown cause.\nBut since last year, Frieden and others said, growing tensions between the Trump administration and China\u2019s leadership have apparently damaged the collaboration.\n\u201cThe message from the administration was, \u2018Don\u2019t work with China, they\u2019re our rival,\u2019\u201d Frieden said.\nTrump\u2019s re-election campaign sent out a statement Sunday evening dismissing controversy about the CDC\u2019S cut as a matter of politics.\n\u201cDemocrats are eager to politicize the coronavirus crisis and weaponize it against President Trump, the statement said. \u201cIn so doing, they\u2019re siding with the Chinese and providing cover for Beijing\u2019s cover-up.\u201d"}, {"content": "China's Wuhan, where the coronavirus emerged, begins to lift its lockdown.

Wuhan will not let people leave the city until April 8.\nSome people at the railway station, such as a woman who only gave her surname as Zhang, said they were there to see if there was any chance people could leave earlier.\nHer grandson came to visit her for the week-long Lunar New Year holiday in January and has been separated from his parents in the southern city of Shenzhen ever since.

There is a new virus in the world, and the question we all ask ourselves is the same: when will it come near us? The nCoV (acronym for \u201cnew coronavirus\u201d) was born thousands of kilometers from Latin America, in a remote region: no city on the continent is among those that receive the most visits from the affected Chinese provinces according to a detailed study. And yet, Google searches for \u201ccoronavirus\u201d have exploded in recent days. In all cases, the alarm comes from a suspicious case. Media and audience are (we are) on the hunt for the Latin American zero patient of nCoV. We have already had several discards: one in the Tamaulipas border, another in Cali, another in northern Argentina, several in Brazil under study right now. Most likely, such a case will come, sooner or later. Everything is moving so fast that it is possible that when you read these lines we already have it among the headlines of the newspaper. But what exactly does that mean? What will it mean for the region that it has imported a still little known respiratory virus? Our brain perceives risks better if it defines them dramatically. We need a character (the disease) and a drastic change in the course of events (the daily routine) to put us on our toes. But the disease seldom behaves according to this Hollywood script, no matter how hard we try to place it within the story. Take, for example, the epidemic of influenza a (swine) born in Mexico in April 2009. From one week to another, the attention of the country (and the entire world) was turned on four characters: H1N1. A sensation of emergency spread quickly, as if moved by electrical impulses, reflected for example in the corresponding Google searches. But the evolution of the epidemic itself was substantially more gradual. What is more: little by little, the scientific teams were distilling the real aggregate impact of the virus, imposing in parallel the necessary containment and response measures. In the end, it was a contagious disease, yes, and surprisingly dangerous for the youngest (when the flu usually affects especially those over 65). But it didn&#39;t mean the mortality catastrophe our minds wanted to dramatize: According to an estimate by the US Center for Disease Control, H1N1 killed roughly the same people as seasonal flu, keeping it below other pandemics in the world. last. Our brains, however, are still bent on looking for dramas even in seemingly cold numbers. One of these figures, which has captured the attention of the audience on social networks about nCoV, is known as R0: the average number of people who will be infected from another already infected by a disease. We were only a few weeks into the epidemic when several epidemiologists came up with their estimates. Some clung to the highest figures to, once again, sound the alarm with messages like &quot;each affected by coronavirus will infect three people.&quot; But the truth is that these estimates were considerably variable. They always are: even with well-known diseases, the R0 value changes enormously depending on the study. It is hardly normal: after all, a disease can behave very differently depending on the social context in which it develops. A viral outbreak in a place without hygienic conditions and with a high population density will not be the same as in a sparsely inhabited rural area. That is why even the most contagious, such as measles, offer enormously wide ranges of contagion. Also, let&#39;s not forget that the averages can be misleading: if it turns out that the contagion value of nCoV in China is 2, this figure is as compatible with the idea of \u200b\u200ba thousand infected transmitting the virus to two people each, as the extreme scenario of ten &quot;super-contagion&quot; that affect fifty more people each (because their work puts them in contact with many people, because there was still no isolation, or for other reasons) and another nine hundred and ninety that infect less than one person per capita. While the first scenario would guarantee an exponential contagion, in the second the control of the virus would be much easier once one identifies the conditions that favor mass transmission. Between both extremes there is a whole world of possibilities that we do not know, and that will determine when and how the nCoV will arrive in Latin America. In reality, what these numbers teach us is that uncertainty is an inescapable aspect when it comes to epidemics. Drama is, in fact, a way of reducing it: if we have a clearly identifiable enemy, fear becomes certainty. But this same bias is what makes us underestimate or ignore those risks to which we have already become accustomed. Even when they suffer a worrying spike. Let&#39;s talk, for example, about the aforementioned measles. In 2016 there were less than a hundred cases in the American continent. Two years later the figure had multiplied one hundred and sixty: about 16,000, accounted for by the WHO, the majority located in Brazil. In 2019 Sao Paulo registered the first death from this disease in two decades. Lack of comprehensive and effective vaccination coverage was the main cause. Malaria, spread through mosquitoes in certain tropical areas, is another case of the return of an adversary who never quite left. But here the weight of the rebound corresponds to Venezuela, which accounted for more than half of the total cases in 2017. Interestingly, although both diseases have drawn disproportionately attention in the respective countries during the last half of 2019, both in Brazil and in Venezuela&#39;s gaze (measured by Google searches) quickly turned to the coronavirus in early 2020, confirming that nothing beats a good, new story of fear and uncertainty. Thus, although our attention follows different logics, while certain diseases are greatly diminished or almost disappeared in the region (cholera is a good example of success), others remain with similar figures (tuberculosis: around 280,000 cases in all the American continent year after year throughout the XXI century) or, like the aforementioned, even recover lost ground. When it comes to looking for causes, there are no simple answers. Mosquito-borne diseases provide a good example. Several Venezuelan doctors on the ground have complained about the absence of state-led fumigations that once served to decimate malaria. But fumigation is not everything: as the magazine of the National Institute of Health of Colombia asked in its March 2016 editorial, of Zika (another virus spread by bites) in Colombia and Brazil, how effective is it really to fumigate in places that do not meet the minimum health conditions (aqueduct, garbage collection)? The director of the Institute of Health and Environment of the Universidad del Bosque, V\u00edctor Olano, pointed out in a later issue of the same publication the need to guarantee these minimum coverage in rural areas as the first line of fire against another disease still present in the continent : yellow fever. We can make a similar reflection in its day with nCoV: although it is likely that all media attention will focus on the design of new drugs, basic proliferation control measures (early identification of cases with their corresponding isolation) and maintenance of healthy immune systems are the most effective, but less spectacular, strategies. Likewise, the best way to prevent this type of epidemic from flourishing is the implementation of hygienic protocols in the treatment of animals by humans, something in which the public authorities also have a lot to say and do. The war against epidemics is not ultimately a matter of a single dramatic battle for the fate of humanity. Neither will it be with nCoV, as it was not with H1N1 (which, although decreased, is still among us). The moral is that, as the Swedish popularizing physician Hans Rosling said, we must tame our thirst for drama and refocus attention, efforts, dedication to what can really have a positive impact. In the case of infectious diseases, vaccines, health protocols and infrastructures, research and the existence of response mechanisms at the international level are our best allies. While the first two points are those that will help us combat already known diseases, research and supra-state capacities are particularly crucial when we are facing a new disease. Aware of this, the World Health Organization agreed on an international regulatory framework in 2005 to ensure commitment to common standards in the region, and throughout the world. Year after year, the WHO itself measures the degree of implementation of the regulations in each country. Although there are obvious differences in the region, the agreement is considerable. There are some worrying points when it comes to readiness, and certain countries are conspicuously behind the rest. Furthermore, it is important to note that these WHO figures do not measure the quality or the effective state of health systems on the ground. Something in which, for example, Venezuela would score well below the rest given the deterioration suffered by its facilities with the crisis of recent years.

Inactivity and uncertainty give China a strange sleepwalking air these days. There are hardly any vehicles or people walking the streets. More than 46 million people are blocked by the quarantine. Many transports, suspended. Classes in schools, canceled until further notice. The shops, closed. The Wuhan coronavirus, which has already killed 170 people and infected more than 7,800, threatens to leave, at least in the short term, profound effects on the country&#39;s economy, which was already facing its lowest growth in decades, 6.1 %. According to the economist Zhang Ming, from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences - the main Chinese state think tank -, in statements collected by Caijing magazine, GDP growth in the first quarter of this year could be reduced by one percentage point and being at 5% or even less, due to the stoppage due to the virus. These days, Chinese cities look like huge deserts. Cinemas, museums, and tourist attractions have canceled their operations. Most of the stores are still closed; those that have opened - with the shop assistants well covered by a mask - hardly register activity, except those that sell groceries. Many restaurants haven&#39;t bothered to reopen even though, under normal conditions, these would be cashier days: now the public avoids crowded places. In Suzhou&#39;s industrial hub, factories are prohibited from reopening until February 8. In Shanghai, companies will not resume their activity until at least the 9. Along with consumption, the sector most affected by the containment measures has been transport. To the blockade of much of Hubei, the province where Wuhan is located - the focus of the infection - is added the recommendation to avoid displacement as much as possible. The airports, in what should be their busiest time of the year, are half empty. Long-distance bus and high-speed train routes have been paralyzed. Travel abroad with tour operators has been suspended. According to official government data, transportation has fallen with respect to the 2019 lunar New Year dates by 28.8%. In the railway sector, the decrease reaches 41.5%. In the air, 41.6%. The situation could not have come at a worse time. The Chinese New Year is, like Christmas or Black Friday in the West, the time of highest consumer spending, a sector that is increasingly important in Chinese GDP. Weak demand and the shocks caused by the trade war between the United States and China had left economic growth at 6.1%, its lowest level in three decades. &quot;The impact of the coronavirus on the Chinese economy may be much more important than that of SARS,&quot; explains Alicia Garc\u00eda-Herrero, chief economist for Asia at investment bank Natixis. Garc\u00eda-Herrero alludes to the syndrome that, also caused by a coronavirus from the same family as that of Wuhan, emerged in 2003 in a market in Canton (southern China) to leave almost 800 fatalities worldwide. Then, that epidemic subtracted one percentage point from Chinese growth during the second quarter of the year, which stood at 9.1%. Retail sales fell by half. Although the blow to the economy was only temporary, and in subsequent quarters growth recovered its previous levels above 10%. But now, Garc\u00eda-Herrero points out, &quot;China depends much more on consumption than it did in 2003, and consumption is definitely going to slow down.&quot; To the luxury and durable goods we must add the hospitality sector. &quot;There are many sectors that are going to be affected, and that are much more important for Chinese growth than they were in 2003, when external demand was the key,&quot; she says. \u201cIn China during 2019, consumption contributed about 3.5 percentage points to the total real growth of 6.1% of GDP. A quick calculation indicates that if spending on these services fell by 10%, total GDP growth would fall by about 1.2 percentage points, \u201dsays the consulting firm S&amp;P Global Ratings in a note. The first signs are not encouraging. In its reopening after the holidays, the shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange have fallen by 2.4%. Due to the closure of the main chains and the suspension of the big premieres, in New Years, when box office records are usually broken, the collection in theaters was only 1.81 million yuan, or about 250,000 euros, according to the company Maoyan ticket sales. It&#39;s a 99% drop from the previous year. &quot;It is a certainty that the coronavirus outbreak will have an impact on economic growth this quarter,&quot; said Mark Williams, of Capital Economics, in a note. Compared to SARS, &quot;while this time the more transparent and active official response may prove more effective in containing the virus, it may also increase the initial economic damage.&quot; A good part of this damage could correspond to the large sector of the Chinese underground economy, the one represented by migrants to urban areas. Back in the countryside to spend the holidays with family members, many have been surprised by the quarantine or have their travel plans altered. The prolonged hiatus of their jobs can leave them without income while it lasts. &quot;After SARS, China adopted an expansionary fiscal policy, including tax cuts, to help the recovery of the most affected sectors,&quot; says Tianlei Huang of the Peterson International Institute of Economics (PIIE). \u201cThis time, China has large fiscal deficits and therefore has less room to apply fiscal stimulus than then. In monetary policy, the central bank may increase liquidity support, but there will be no credit-driven stimulus \u201d. The key, analysts point out, will be how quickly the crisis is resolved. &quot;Depending on how the crisis is reduced, and especially how the Chinese government manages it - not to a small extent how transparent it is - the cost could exacerbate the decline in Chinese growth,&quot; says Huang."}, {"content": "France extends to three cases of the Wuhan virus, the first in Europe. The Wuhan virus has already reached Europe. Specifically in France, where three cases have been confirmed, two in Paris and one in Bordeaux, as reported by the Ministry of Health on Friday. The announcement coincides with the research being carried out by Spain, which is studying whether a woman in the Basque Country who recently returned from China is infected by the coronavirus, since she presents symptoms linked to this disease. This same Friday, the Spanish Ministry of Health ruled out two other possible infections and the United States detected the existence of a second affected by the disease, which has already caused 41 deaths in China, according to the latest figures updated by Bloomberg, and keeps 41 in quarantine million people in that country. When announcing the first two cases early in the evening, the French Minister of Health, Agn\u00e8s Buzyn, warned that everything indicates that these first European cases will not be the only ones. Shortly after, her office confirmed the third case, related to one of the first two detected. &quot;It is likely that there are other&quot; infected people on European territory, said Buzyn, for whom the virus &quot;is a fire that must be delimited.&quot; In all the French cases, these are people who have been to China and, at least one of them, is known to have been in the city of Wuhan. This is the patient admitted to Bordeaux, a 48-year-old Chinese citizen who went to a medical center on Thursday 23 to \u201cconsult for the symptoms\u201d that he presented after his return a day before from China, where \u201che passed through the city of Wuhan\u201d for &quot;professional reasons,&quot; Buzyn explained at a press conference. The victim has been admitted since the day before in Bordeaux &quot;in an isolated room&quot; and &quot;is fine&quot;, although before confirming his illness &quot;he was in contact with a dozen people since his return to France.&quot; The health authorities are going to &quot;contact&quot; these people to verify his health, he said. Less is known about the two Parisian cases. From the first announced, Buzyn revealed that she is admitted to the Bichat hospital in the capital. &quot;We know that this person traveled to China, but we do not know if he was in Wuhan,&quot; added the minister, a doctor by profession. In a statement at the end of midnight, her ministry indicated that another case that was being investigated had been confirmed, and that it is related to one of the first patients. The third person affected, for whom no data has been given beyond that he was also in China, is also admitted to Paris. &quot;All isolation and hygiene measures have been taken,&quot; said the Ministry of Health. Buzyn has insisted that &quot;it is possible&quot; that new affected people will be located in France, although she has assured that everything possible is being done to &quot;contain&quot; the spread of the virus in the country. The minister has asked travelers returning from China not to go to the hospital emergency services at the slightest sign of discomfort, but to contact the health authorities by phone beforehand, &quot;to avoid any potential contagion.&quot; Meanwhile, in Spain, the Directorate of Public Health and Addictions of the Department of Health of the Basque Government has been notified this afternoon of a suspected case of pneumonia associated with the Chinese coronavirus. This is a woman who has recently returned from Wuhan province in China and has pathologies linked to this disease. The affected is admitted in isolation at the University Hospital of Cruces, according to Europa Press. The Basque Department of Health has reported that the analytical sample has already been sent to the National Microbiology Center of Majadahonda, a reference laboratory to carry out this specific analysis, and it is expected to have the result in the next 24-48 hours. In addition, two other cases that were studied in Spain as suspects for the Wuhan coronavirus have tested negative. This was notified by the Ministry of Health on Friday afternoon after the director of the Center for Coordination and Health Emergencies of the Ministry of Health, Fernando Sim\u00f3n, reported that same day that two people were being studied for possible contagion, since both recently arrived in Spain from the Chinese city where the infection originated with some symptoms. The health authorities of the United States have confirmed this Friday a second case in the country of the aggressive coronavirus. Like the first case, detected last weekend in Seattle, it is a person who recently traveled to the city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the health crisis. So far, the virus has caused 41 deaths, all in China, all but two in the Wuhan region. More than 1,100 have been contaminated in that country, of which almost two hundred are in a serious condition. Authorities are also monitoring 1,072 suspected cases. So far, the virus has reached Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, Nepal, Taiwan, Macao, the United States, France, and Japan."}, {"content": "Coronavirus: delivery bottlenecks in industry and trade. The consequences of the coronavirus epidemic in China will increasingly affect Germany&#39;s industry and trade in the next few weeks. Since many Chinese factories have been idle for weeks and are currently only working to a limited extent, there is a lack of preliminary products, parts or complete products that are processed or sold in this country. Among other things, the electronics industry is affected. Not only imports are disrupted, but also deliveries to China. The EU trade ministers originally wanted to discuss the issue on Thursday, but the meeting has been canceled. The average transport time from China to Europe by sea is six weeks; overland by freight train on the New Silk Road it is around three weeks. Therefore, the effects of the Chinese corona shutdown are now having a delay on production and trade in Europe. With imports of 52 billion euros, China is &quot;by far the largest foreign supplier for the German electronics market,&quot; says Andreas Gontermann, chief economist of the Central Association of Electrical Engineering and Electronics Industry (ZVEI). &quot;The delivery problems do not affect the industry across the board,&quot; he says. \u201cHowever, a number of companies report disruptions in the supply and production chains.\u201d Gontermann puts the volume of wholesale products delivered from China to Germany at a value of 10 billion euros per year. &quot;How much of it is at risk of delivery is difficult to estimate,&quot; says Gontermann. And that&#39;s not all: \u201cIn addition, intermediate consumption from other countries can also contain Chinese intermediate consumption,\u201d he explains. The Japanese and South Korean economies are currently slowing down, both countries are very important for the electronics industry. Consumers are also likely to feel the effects in the electronics markets. &quot;Currently there are no delivery bottlenecks due to the restrictions of the coronavirus, we are currently expecting the first possible delivery bottlenecks and rising cost of goods in April,&quot; says Alexander Maier, Senior Vice President at Ingram Micro, a wholesaler for electrical and electronic equipment based in the Munich suburb of Aschheim Electronic products. &quot;We are currently working on strategies to be able to react quickly to these effects and to continue to offer our customers the best possible availability of goods.&quot; The automotive industry is also concerned. &quot;Production is currently running at all locations,&quot; says an Audi spokeswoman in Ingolstadt. &quot;Of course there is no telling how the situation will develop in the medium term - especially with regard to the supply chain. We try to cushion any impending bottlenecks with targeted measures.&quot; Audi is based in Bavaria, where the companies are particularly dependent on foreign countries and generate more than half of their sales outside the German borders. &quot;Supply chains between China and Bavaria are interrupted and, from today&#39;s perspective, will be even more interrupted in the coming weeks, for example if pre-crisis products have been processed and no more follow them,&quot; says Bertram Brossardt, General Manager of the Association of Bavarian Economy (vbw). The most important import goods from China for the Bavarian economy are data processing equipment, electronic and optical products, electrical equipment and machines. \u201cWe expect an interruption in the supply chain roughly proportional to the volume of the individual product groups,\u201d says Brossardt. This should apply analogously to companies in the rest of the republic that are supplied from China. The effects on the supply of medication cannot be assessed by outsiders. According to the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices in Bonn, there are currently no coronavirus-related bottlenecks. But India - where many copycat drugs are manufactured for the world market - last week limited the export of 26 common active ingredients, including paracetamol and several antibiotics. A major wholesaler for medicines is the Mannheim-based Phoenix Pharmahandel - and the company sticks: &quot;We cannot evaluate the subject of your inquiry,&quot; said a spokesman. The pharmaceutical association Progenerika explains that it is not assumed &quot;that there will be supply bottlenecks in Germany due to Corona by the summer of 2020&quot;. What comes next? &quot;Not yet in sight.&quot; (Dpa)"}, {"content": "The informant. He is now the most famous virologist in Germany. In 2003 he deciphered the Sars virus and now developed the first detection test for the new coronavirus from Wuhan. Since then, everyone has asked for his advice. It should actually be impossible to get to Christian Drosten. But the director of the Institute for Virology at the Berlin Charit\u00e9 is radically adhering to a strategy that he made his credo during the Sars epidemic: all information has to be made out, everything has to be made public. This is the only way to keep a virus at bay. So Christian Drosten hurries to his office last Monday - he&#39;s a little late, he has just been in the Foreign Office, looks through a few e-mails, takes a seat at a round natural wood table, leans back and is focused. Given the technical progress, isn&#39;t the situation much better today than it was during the Sars epidemic? &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; says Drosten. On the one hand, a lot of genome analyzes made it possible to find out very quickly that the virus had not been circulating among humans for long. &quot;That is a good way of assessing the epidemic.&quot; On the other hand, the mobility of Chinese society has changed drastically. &quot;I can well imagine that this alone explains the rapid spread of the current virus.&quot; The 47-year-old doctor has been dealing with coronaviruses his entire professional life. When the Sars pathogen (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) began its epidemic at the end of 2002, initially nobody knew what kind of germ it was. At that time Christian Drosten was working at the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg and developing diagnostic tests for infectious diseases. The young scientist managed to identify the pathogen causing Sars, a coronavirus that is similar to the current 2019-nCoV in China. At that time, he and a colleague were able to present a verification test in a very short time. Two years later he was awarded the Federal Cross of Merit. At the age of just 35, Drosten then moved to the Institute of Virology at the University Hospital Bonn, and ten years later he went to the Charit\u00e9. There the virologist and his team have been following every move of the new corona virus for weeks. Without having had it himself in the laboratory, he developed the test for it. Drosten does not claim that he already understands the virus. Like everyone involved, he has to deal with the fact that the data situation changes every hour. At first it was said from China that the virus could not be transmitted from person to person. That was soon out of date. Then it was said that drastic measures such as the cordoning off of entire metropolises could contain the virus in China. A mistake. The image of the corona virus is sharpening more slowly than the fast-paced media world demands. That is why Drosten only formulates one working hypothesis on this day: The new type of coronavirus is basically like Sars. At this point in time, he deduces that 2019-nCoV can only be transmitted by people with symptoms. A day later, it is said that a Chinese woman from Shanghai transmitted the virus to employees of a company in Bavaria, allegedly she was asymptomatic. An alarm signal: In asymptomatic hosts, the virus can travel far undetected and infect many people along the way. A specialist article about the Bavarian case appears in the renowned New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and the WHO declares a global health emergency. A week later it is clear that the Chinese had back pain and was taking an antipyretic drug, which is why the infection was not noticed - and that the authors of the article had not spoken to the Chinese. Christian Drosten&#39;s name was also under the publication. It is uncomfortable for him. Normally you check all the facts in a group of authors, he says, &quot;but in this case I just had to trust the authors who have dealt much longer with the patient&#39;s case history&quot;. As a confirmation laboratory, he only supplied data, and he stands for it. But isn&#39;t this mishap an example that publishing data prematurely is harmful? But Drosten sticks to his demand for maximum transparency. The fact that the patient still gave lectures despite the illness and was able to infect colleagues shows that the virus spreads more easily than initially assumed. But the glitch with the article in the NEJM proves another worrying development. &quot;Today the journals actively put pressure on the speed and want sensation.&quot; And that also applies to high-ranking publications. Drosten published the very first paper on the novel coronavirus in Eurosurveillance, the scientific journal of the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control. &quot;We could have published that in the NEJM,&quot; he says, &quot;but deliberately didn&#39;t do it.&quot; It was more important to him that all data is made fully available online so that everyone can read it. The only thing that helps in a situation with insufficient data is transparency, says Drosten. Because only if all information is immediately available to the responsible institutions can incorrect assumptions be corrected and correct reactions initiated. When he upheld this rigorous demand during the Sars epidemic and published genetic data early on, it was &quot;totally unusual,&quot; he says. And today he is annoyed that some colleagues still did not understand and were holding back important current data. Drosten is also fighting behind the scenes to ensure that science journals introduce new transparency rules. Manuscripts should only be accepted in the context of an epidemic outbreak if the authors simultaneously stored the data on a publicly accessible pre-print server. &quot;This is the only regulation that can work to finally bring transparency into this system or to prevent the system from slowing down progress in fighting epidemics.&quot; The virologist himself also practices transparency in public. A colleague of his says that Drosten is one of the few virologists who fully understand epidemics - both the molecular biological side and the clinical aspects and educational work. He learned from the Sars crisis, says Drosten, that in addition to the transparent dissemination of scientific data, open communication with the population is essential. &quot;Just knowing about the disease back then in Hong Kong was enough to bring patients to the doctor earlier.&quot; If the situation escalates, as is currently the case in Wuhan, &quot;every drastic message is appropriate&quot;. Because only then would people change their behavior: avoid crowds and maintain the necessary social distance. Spreading one&#39;s knowledge now eats up a large part of Christian Drosten&#39;s time. Which is not entirely harmless for him. &quot;I&#39;m not sure if that is so good for me as a scientist,&quot; he says. &quot;You have to be careful not to become a television professor.&quot; At the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organization WHO an accumulation of pneumonia of unknown cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Just a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days later, a group led by virologist Christian Drosten from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers are provisionally calling 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. The Chinese authorities suspect the source of the pathogen to be a food market in Wuhan, where not only fish and seafood but also exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected. Both Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic in 2002 and 2003, around 8,000 people were infected and more than 750 died. Between its discovery in 2012 and the end of 2019, around 2,500 people were infected with the Mers virus, and every third person died from it. In total, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example. Several thousand people have now become ill in China, some of them - most of them probably with previous illnesses - died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first cases of infection outside of China became known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been to Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who was returning from Wuhan, and on January 24, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia, which can be fatal. Since it is a viral disease, antibiotics won&#39;t help. It is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after a dozen or so cases among medical personnel became known. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. As it announced on January 24, the World Health Organization currently expects that an infected person will infect an average of 1.4 to 2.5 other people. If these numbers prove to be true, the virus is less contagious than Sars and so is the flu. The WHO recommends following general hygiene rules: You should wash your hands often and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals. It is not yet possible to say with certainty. The World Health Organization announced on January 28th that around a fifth of the reported cases would become seriously ill from the virus, so if in doubt they would have to be treated in intensive care. According to reports, the first fatalities were patients, some of whom had serious previous illnesses. People with previous illnesses are also particularly at risk from other infectious diseases - such as the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, i.e. change their genetic makeup. That can make them more dangerous to people in the course of an outbreak - but also the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate that is as high as that of the Sars outbreak."}, {"content": "RPT-China stocks off 2020 lows as Beijing calms nerves over virus outbreak.

A new virus has China on alert. It is a mysterious pneumonia, from which dozens of people have been infected in the city of Wuhan and which corresponds to a new strain of a coronavirus similar to the one that caused the epidemic of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome, for its acronym in 2002). in English). This has been confirmed by the Chinese national television, CCTV, according to the investigations of a group of scientists who have managed to isolate the genetic sequence of the infectious agent. Medical tests have confirmed the presence of this new pathogen in 15 of the 59 cases detected since the beginning of December, all of them in Wuhan, capital of Hubei province. The origin of most of these infections has been located in a fish and shellfish market, where live animals were traded. Since then, the area has been closed and quarantined. To date, none of the patients has died and even eight patients, who no longer showed any symptoms, were discharged yesterday Wednesday. Local health authorities have ensured that no human-to-human transmission has been detected. Coronaviruses, which get their name from the corona shape they take when viewed through the microscope, often attack the airways of mammals. To date, only six were known. Four cause mild cold-like symptoms. The other two, on the other hand, are sadly famous: in 2002, the SARS coronavirus, which originated in China, killed more than 700 people worldwide; while in 2015 MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) left 449 dead. Given the background, the news has been received with concern in the country. &quot;I am very afraid. I remember that SARS appeared together before the Spring Festival and then it spread thanks to the means of transport \u201d, wrote a user on Weibo, a social network similar to Twitter. His words refer to the Chinese New Year, which in 2020 will take place on January 25. On the occasion of this national holiday, it is tradition that people return to the family home, causing the largest human migration in the world, with more than 3,000 million displacements: an ideal scenario for the spread of a virus. The mysterious ailment, however, could have already jumped outside the borders of the Asian giant. In South Korea, a woman of Chinese nationality has been placed in isolation on the possibility that she is infected, according to the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) on Wednesday. The 36-year-old woman was diagnosed with pneumonia on Tuesday, after two business trips in which she, among other cities, visited Wuhan.

The World Health Organization does not consider it necessary, at the moment, to establish special measures for travelers. This was announced in a statement made public this morning, ensuring that &quot;new coronaviruses appear periodically [...] and China has a solid health system, capable of responding and managing outbreaks of respiratory infections.&quot; The institution, which has shown its willingness to provide technical support to the country&#39;s health authorities, has ruled that &quot;in the coming weeks more comprehensive information will be needed to better understand the current status and epidemiology of the outbreak.&quot; Scientists responsible for identifying the virus have expressed themselves in the same direction, assuring that their initial finding must be completed with more research. Although it is possible to obtain evidence of the presence of pathogens in a short period of time, producing a vaccine can take years. Professor David Hui Shu-cheong, an expert in respiratory medicine at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, has assured the South China Morning Post that some key details are still to be clarified such as &quot;which animal is the source of the virus, the incubation period and the transmission route \u201d. Some specialists, such as Peng Yihong, a professor at the Beijing School of Medicine, have ventured that the cause of the outbreak could be in &quot;the pathogens contained in the karst caves, the place of origin of many of the shellfish that end up on the market.&quot; ."}, {"content": "Why all coronavirus cases in India are from Kerala. \nThe spotlight is now turned on the connect between Wuhan and Kerala as India's all three positive novel coronavirus cases so far are students of a university in the historic Chinese city, the epicentre of the epidemic.\nWuhan has been a popular destination for Keralites and others as an educational hub with quality and affordable medical courses attracting overseas scholars.\nImpressed by factors like affordability, amenities and international standards in medical education, offered in English, students from Kerala have been flocking to Wuhan University School of Medicine in China.\nWuhan, over 1,000 km from Chinese capital of Beijing and 800 plus km away from the top class metropolis Shanghai, is a historic city and played a key role in the 20th century history of China.\n\"I am very happy about the medical education system at Wuhan university.

Now comes the tricky part - shipping it there: Russell. LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - China\u2019s domestic coal mines are struggling to ramp up production in the face of the ongoing coronavirus epidemic. That\u2019s a situation that may seem positive for seaborne exporters, but in reality it may be challenging for miners to take advantage.\nWhile there may be increased demand for imported coal in China in coming weeks, the problem for major exporters such as Indonesia, Australia and the United States is going to be one of logistics.\nThe coronavirus is starting to have an impact on supply chains and will make it more challenging for shippers to find vessels to go to China. And even if exporters do get their goods to Chinese ports, they will likely face headaches in unloading cargoes and transporting them from docks to end-users.\nBy Thursday, the country\u2019s health authority said, the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak that started in the Chinese city of Wuhan had reached 563, with more than 28,000 others infected.\nWhile the fatalities and infections draw headlines, the impact of the virus is starting to cascade through China\u2019s economy - as well as businesses in countries that trade heavily with the world\u2019s largest consumer of commodities.\nThe challenge of shipping coal to China was illustrated by the Australian government\u2019s decision to impose a 14-day quarantine on vessels leaving mainland China after Feb. 1.\nThis means such vessels will face delays upon reaching Australian ports, as the sailing time between China and both the east and west coasts of Australia is generally less than 14 days.\nVessel queues outside Australian coal ports are already lengthening. Argus Media reported on Feb. 4 that the number of ships waiting outside Newcastle, the world\u2019s largest coal export harbor, was at an 18-month high of 20 vessels.\nThere are some other factors that may be contributing to longer vessel waiting times, such as weather and port and rail maintenance, but the overall trend is clear: Shipments to, as well as from, China are becoming more complicated to arrange.\nOne thing that is working in exporters\u2019 favor is a sharp decline in shipping rates. The rate to ship coal from Newcastle to China dropped to $5.87 a tonne on Wednesday, the lowest in almost four years and about a third of the $16.49 peak reached in September last year.\nAt these freight prices, shipping companies will be losing money on every voyage, while they are also facing higher costs from the mandatory switch to cleaner fuels that kicked in last month as part of a change in global shipping regulations known as IMO2020.\nWhile the cost of shipping may be depressed, the main challenge will be securing vessels with owners prepared to send them to China.\nCertainly, Asian seaborne coal prices have yet to show any meaningful spike from China\u2019s domestic coal woes.\nThe price of 6,000 kilocalorie per kilogram (kcal/kg) coal at Newcastle, as assessed by brokers Tullett Prebon climbed to $69.35 a tonne on Thursday, up from a recent low of $66.30 on Feb. 3, but still below the high so far this year of $72 on Jan. 13.\nThe price of lower-quality 4,200 kcal/kg coal from Indonesia has fared better, with the weekly Argus index rising to a six-month high of $35.48 a tonne in the week ended Jan. 31.\nThe rise in the Indonesian coal price follows similar gains in domestic prices in China, with thermal coal at Qinhuangdao, as assessed by SteelHome ending at 563 yuan ($80.66) on Wednesday, down slightly from 564 yuan on Feb. 4, which was the highest in three months.\nThe coal market appears to be reacting with caution to the coronavirus, with still considerable uncertainty over how much domestic output has been lost, what transport bottlenecks exist currently in China and whether more imported coal will be needed. Even if it is, can it get there efficiently?\nWhat is becoming clearer is that the efforts to contain the virus by limiting economic activity in China is going to have multiple flow-on effects through commodity supply chains.\n(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)"}, {"content": "Coronavirus: Developed countries pump aid to fight Covid-19, Britain latest to face lockdown.

Grace Dowell, a 63-year-old grandmother, has stopped grocery shopping and cancelled all her doctor\u2019s appointments. No one is allowed into her rural Maryland home. Every piece of mail is disinfected.  \n Dowell decided last week that strict isolation was the only way to protect herself, her husband and her mother from COVID-19, the virus that has killed more than 10,000 people across the globe and is proving especially deadly for the elderly.  \n Dowell, a retired labour union worker, has rheumatoid arthritis and a compromised immune system. Her husband Donald, 74, suffers from emphysema. Her mother, Margaret Hildebrandt, 93, also has a lung disease and needs oxygen. Dowell took over her mother\u2019s care from a visiting nurse because she worried an outsider could contaminate the home.  \n \u201cIf my mom gets this, she\u2019d be gone in a day,\u201d said Dowell, who wears a baby-monitor and answers her mother\u2019s calls for help through the night. \u201cMy mom beat cancer nine times. I don\u2019t want her to die from this.\u201d  \n The elderly are especially vulnerable in the global pandemic and health officials and governments are increasingly calling for extreme measures to safeguard them. Across the globe, many cities have all but shut down as officials issue dire warnings for younger people - who can carry the virus without knowing it - to avoid their parents and grandparents. But this growing isolation of the elderly has spawned its own crisis, as families try to balance the need to care for loved ones with directives to stay away, shifting the burden to overstretched governments and medical facilities.  \n Studies suggest the severity of coronavirus rises with age. In Italy, which now has the world\u2019s highest death count, the average age of those dying is 80, according to a study by the Italian national institute of health. In China, where the pandemic started, people 70 and older accounted for just 12 percent of all infections but more than half of all deaths, according to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. In the United States, people 65 and older have thus far accounted for 31 percent of cases, 53 percent of intensive care hospitalizations and 80 percent of deaths, according to U.S. government data.  \n Beyond the grim statistics, the pandemic has spawned countless small dramas of isolation and anxiety across the globe. In a village in Lebanon, a grandmother walled herself off in her home, unable to properly grieve her dead husband. In Spain, nursery home workers produced a Facebook video so residents could reassure their loved ones. And in Colombia - where the government on Tuesday ordered citizens 70 and over to stay inside until May 31 - seniors stocked up on supplies for two months of isolation.  \n \u201cThey need to take these measures because many people are taking the situation lightly,\u201d said shopper Carlos Manrique, 74, as he loaded up on potatoes, eggs and rice at a supermarket in Bogota. \u201cI\u2019m taking care of myself, as God orders.\u201d  \n Just as often, older people greeted the epidemic with defiance.  \n \u201cI am not worried about the coronavirus at all,\u201d said Yutaka Kobayashi, 85, who refuses to wear a mask while working in his Tokyo shoe store. \u201cPeople of my generation were made to wash their hands by their mothers and grandmothers.\u201d  \n  \n (GRAPHIC: GRAPHIC: Coronavirus kills older people at much higher rates - https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS-AGE/0100B5L744Y/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS.jpg)  \n  \n \u2018HELLO GRAN, HOW ARE YOU?\u2019  \n In Italy, where more than 3,400 people have died since the outbreak came to light on Feb. 21, local officials fret about the psychological state of elderly people confined to their homes for weeks in a government lockdown. The town of San Casciano in Val di Pesa launched an initiative called \u201cCiao Nonna, come stai?\u201d or \u201cHello Gran, how are you?\u201d urging all young people to call elderly relatives \u2013 or even older people they don\u2019t know.  \n One nursing home, Nuestra Casa La Grande in Navares de Enmedio, Spain, recorded a video of 24 elderly residents and posted it on Facebook, encouraging each other to blow kisses to the camera for their loved ones.  \n Jonathan Barrios, a 24-year-old student living with his parents in La Parla, Madrid, said he doesn\u2019t dare see his grandparents, who live on the same street. His 80-year-old grandfather has lung cancer. His grandmother, 70, has symptoms of the virus - a fever, cough and difficulty breathing - but can\u2019t get tested because of a shortage of kits.  \n \u201cI feel strange and frustrated,\u201d Barrios said. \u201cAll I can do for my grandparents is to call them.\u201d  \n The forced isolation perhaps cuts deepest for those in mourning. Joey Ayoub, a Lebanese researcher, said his grandfather died this week of problems unrelated to the coronavirus. He worries for his grandmother, who suddenly lives alone.  \n Only six or seven people attended her husband\u2019s funeral, which Ayoub said would otherwise have attracted \u201cdozens and dozens.\u201d They all sat at a distance from one another during a rushed service.  \n \"She can't mourn properly,\u201d he said. \u201cShe cannot do it with friends.\u201d  \n  \n \u2018IF I GET IT, I GET IT\u2019  \n Some families have been hit hard when senior care centres closed, forcing them to take off work to watch over relatives. In the central Japan city of Nagoya, the mayor asked 126 such facilities to shut down for two weeks after a cluster of coronavirus cases was found at one of them.  \n Japan has already weathered serious outbreaks of the virus and has huge numbers of people at risk - more than 28 percent of the nation\u2019s population is 65 or over. But now, some people are venturing out again.  \n \"If I get it, I get it,\u201d said Kazuko Mori, 74, a part-time cleaner in suburban Ichikawa, which had clusters of cases originating at a sports gym and an elderly daycare service. \u201cIf you get too nervous about it all, that isn't good, either.\"  \n Many elderly people said they can\u2019t follow government directives to stay home.  \n In Kibera, a settlement of densely packed neighbourhoods where few homes have running water in Kenya\u2019s capital Nairobi, volunteers knocked on doors to tell people \u2013 especially the elderly \u2013 about the coronavirus. In one courtyard filled with children, Fatima Juma listened intently as Zulela Abdul explained the risks to her and handed over a small bottle of hand sanitizer.  \n Juma, who says she\u2019s about 82, had heard of the disease on television but didn\u2019t know its symptoms. She was fine with washing her hands but rejected the idea of social distancing. She takes care of her grandchildren, the youngest one two years old, while their parents worked. She also needed to see her friends, she said.  \n \u201cThis government directive is not good for me. I need to go to the market,\u201d she said firmly, bangles flashing in the sunlight. \u201cIf there is a death outside, I need to go and console that person.\u201d  \n In Communist-run Cuba, which has Latin America\u2019s oldest population, many people are forced to work long after retirement age to supplement meagre pensions. Even in normal times, they endure long lines at stores and pharmacies.  \n \"I am very worried because I have asthma, and if I get it, I will die,\" said Maria Torres Hernandez, 75, waiting alongside dozens of others outside a pharmacy in central Havana that had just received its ration of supplies. \u201cI have to look after myself.\u201d  \n Angel Pupo Osorio, 80, works as a parking attendant in Havana to supplement his $12-a-month pension, and can\u2019t afford to quit. So far, the disease hasn\u2019t hit his neighbourhood.  \n \u201cI\u2019m going to continue working as long as I can, out of necessity,\u201d said Pupo, wearing his uniform, a scarlet jacket and cap.  \n  \n \u2018ISOLATE MYSELF HOW?\u2019  \n Lucy Mayimela, a 68-year-old grandmother, first heard about the coronavirus on Monday when she made a trip to buy spinach for her fruit and vegetable stand in Kliptown, on the outskirts of Johannesburg. The farmer selling it to her wore a mask and insisted everyone repeatedly wash their hands before touching anything.  \n Mayimela laughed bitterly at a suggestion she heard on the radio that she should isolate herself at home.  \n \u201cIsolate myself how?\u201d she scoffed.  \n She lives in a small shack with six relatives, in a community with a single wash basin and toilet for dozens of people. The produce stand she has run for 36 years provides her family\u2019s only income.  \n \u201cI\u2019ll end up dying of hunger\u201d if people stay indoors, she said. \u201cIf God wants me to die, then it\u2019s my time.\u201d REUTERS"}, {"content": "u.s. cdc reports 44,183 coronavirus cases, 544 deaths.

China&#39;s president today told his American counterpart Donald Trump that countries must &quot;unite against the pandemic&quot; despite growing rivalry, reported the Chinese state press. &quot;China is ready to continue sharing, without reservation, information and experiences with the United States,&quot; Xi Jinping said, according to state television CCTV, in a message of appeasement after a diplomatic crisis between Beijing and Washington, marked by exchanges of accusations . Since the outbreak of the new coronavirus spread, Trump has intensified criticism of China, regularly accusing Chinese authorities of failing to communicate crucial data on the severity of the virus in the initial weeks. According to Xi Jinping, China &quot;wasted no time&quot; and &quot;immediately shared the genetic makeup of the virus with the United States and the World Health Organization&quot; (WHO). &quot;Only a collective response from the international community can win this battle,&quot; Xi said, quoted by the official Xinhua news agency. The Chinese leader also called for the acceleration of cooperation and scientific research on a global scale to defeat an enemy that &quot;does not distinguish between ethnicities&quot; and is &quot;common to humanity&quot;. Trump and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have often referred to the new coronavirus as the &quot;Chinese virus&quot;, sparking outrage in Beijing. The Chinese government accused Trump of &quot;doing away with his responsibilities&quot; and several Chinese diplomats shared conspiracy theories via the social network Twitter, blocked in China, defending that the virus was introduced in the country by the US military, despite the lack of evidence scientific. The telephone conversation held today between the two heads of state had a conciliatory tone. Xi Jinping recalled that cooperation is the &quot;only good decision&quot; at a &quot;particularly crucial&quot; moment in relations between the two countries. &quot;I hope the American side takes concrete steps to improve bilateral relations,&quot; said the Chinese President, pointing to the sale and donation of medical equipment to the United States, which is already the country with the most diagnosed cases of infection. The new coronavirus, responsible for the covid-19 pandemic, has already infected over 505,000 people worldwide, of which around 23,000 have died. After appearing in China in December, the outbreak spread across the world, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a pandemic situation. The European continent, with almost 275,000 infected and 16,000 dead, is currently the one with the highest number of cases, and Italy is the country with the most fatalities in the world, with 8,165 deaths in 80,539 cases registered to date. China, not counting the territories of Hong Kong and Macau, has 81,340 cases (more than 74 thousand recovered) and registers 3,292 deaths. The most affected countries after Italy, Spain and China are Iran, with 2,234 reported deaths (29,406 cases), France, with 1,696 deaths (29,155 cases), and the United States, with 1,178 deaths. On Thursday, the United States became the country with the most cases of infections in the world, surpassing Italy and China, with more than 85,000 cases.

NORWICH: The SARS outbreak in 2002 to 2003 was the first global pandemic of the 21st century. \n There were over 8,400 reported cases and 11 per cent of those infected with the virus died. Its cause was a newly identified coronavirus (a type of virus that causes respiratory infections): SARS Co-V. \n Early cases were linked to wildlife markets and restaurants in Guangdong, China, where researchers found SARS-like coronaviruses in animals including masked palm civets and a racoon dog. \n A Chinese government team subsequently reported that 66 out of 508 wildlife handlers tested in other markets across Guangdong were positive for antibodies to the SARS virus. \n The Chinese authorities responded by imposing a temporary ban on the hunting, sale, transportation and export of all wild animals in southern China. They also quarantined or culled civets reared for human consumption in the many civet farms across the area. \n THE WILDLIFE TRADE THREATENS HUMAN HEALTH \n Civets testing positive for SARS may have secondary infections rather than being the source of the virus. \n They were probably infected during the \u201cspeed dating\u201d of zoonotic viruses circulating among the jumble of different animal species packed together at markets or while being transported to markets, often in China. \n At the Royal Society\u2019s international conference on Lessons from SARS in 2004 and in the related publication, we emphasised that wildlife trade was a threat to human health and a primary cause of biodiversity decline in China and South-East Asia. \n But here we are again, 17 years later, with another novel zoonotic coronavirus, this time in Wuhan, China. Once again, initial human cases were linked to a market selling a variety of live animals. \n A constantly changing range of species have been selected as the culprits in the past few days, including bats and snakes, (the latter results were quickly refuted), and even crickets and wolf cubs. \n But, as yet, there is no scientific evidence that the virus has been isolated from any of these, although a recent report stated that \u201c15 environmental specimens collected in the western section (of the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market) were positive for 2019-nCoV virus through testing and genetic sequencing analysis\u201d. \n  \n The report continues: \u201cDespite extensive searching, no animal from the market has thus far been identified as a possible source of infection.\u201d \n It is not evident what \u201cenvironmental specimens\u201d refers to here and a complete list of those animals present in, or available from, the market would be appropriate to release together with details of which and how many of these have so far been tested. \n Wild rodents, which are often present in these markets, should also have been collected and tested as SARS-like coronaviruses have also been isolated from wild rats in China. \n PERFECT CONDITIONS FOR PANDEMICS \n But we may be chasing our tails, as animals testing positive may not be the source of the current outbreak. We need to step back and learn the broader lessons here. \n The perfect conditions for the emergence of human pandemics from previously unknown zoonotic pathogens has been created as a result of three things. \n First, the shift from subsistence hunting of wildlife to its sale into an international trade network largely driven by demand in China. \n Second, the extensive cross-exposure within this wildlife trade of species and species populations, which would not mix or be in contact in the wild. \n And, third, the exploitation of new source populations as areas become depleted of target species. \n  \n It is also important to emphasise that these wild animals are typically now more expensive to buy (sometime a status symbol) than domestic livestock, so the demand that perpetuates wildlife trade in the region is a dietary choice and not driven by low income. \n WILL REMOVING SUCH MARKETS HELP? \n The solution is collective action to remove the demand and also the supply chains to these wildlife markets and \u201cfarms\u201d (often laundering animals from the wild rather than breeding them). \n The call to close wildlife markets across China \u2013 which started following the SARS outbreak \u2013 has also been echoed by experts in China and in external organisations worldwide, such as the Wildlife Conservation Society. \n We have to hope that the Wuhan outbreak is a wake-up call for regulation of wildlife trade and animal health, action that is urgently needed to protect human health and the environment. \n Diana Bell is Professor of Conservation Biology, University of East Anglia.

Portuguese who are working in Macau&#39;s casinos, which were forced to close due to the outbreak of the new coronavirus, told Lusa this Thursday that they will return to the country for a &#39;forced&#39; vacation. With hotel occupancy rates declining dramatically and gaming rooms closed at the discretion of the Macau Government, the integrated resorts encouraged workers in various departments to anticipate their holidays. Several Portuguese contacted by Lusa, who asked not to be identified because they were not allowed to speak, explained that the casinos offered a bonus system (additional days) to workers who scheduled vacations for the next few weeks. Earlier in the week, information circulated that operators were sending workers home without pay, which prompted a reaction from the Macau government, which expressed its opposition and recalled the obligation for companies to comply with labor legislation. The lack of effective work and travel prices to Portugal, which are cheaper than usual, largely due to the decrease in demand for flights due to the outbreak of the new Chinese coronavirus, convinced the Portuguese to opt for a temporary return to Portugal. For the rest, the general consul of Portugal in Macau and Hong Kong, told Lusa this Thursday that the Portuguese &quot;who are not involved in a continuous professional activity may consider traveling to Portugal to see family and friends&quot;. Macau authorities have taken exceptional measures to reduce the risk of contagion from the new coronavirus, which has killed 563 people and infected more than 28,000 people in China, where the outbreak began, in a city in the center of the country, Wuhan, capital of the province of Macau. Hubei. Macau, where ten people infected with the new coronavirus were identified, closed the casinos and announced the closure of cultural and sporting spaces, as well as all kinds of businesses, which is practically paralyzing the economy, already in recession. On Wednesday, economist Albano Martins told Lusa that Macau could lose 15 billion patacas (1.7 billion euros) of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in just 15 days of economic downturn. And that the Macau Government may fail to collect revenue of 4.7 billion patacas (530 million euros). &quot;This is only a 15-day projection. If the situation drags on, and I believe it does, then the impact will be dramatic, for the economy in general, for game operators in particular, and for people,&quot; he said. . Casino revenues in Macau had already fallen by 11.3% in January, compared to the same period in 2019, a result explained by the authorities by the outbreak of the new coronavirus, which reduced the flow of players in the world&#39;s gaming capital. To illustrate the scale of the tourist loss, the number of visitors to Macau during the so-called &quot;Golden Week&quot; of the Lunar New Year, from 24th to 31st January, was down almost 80% compared to the same period in 2019. In late January , the financial rating agency Fitch Ratings warned that if the coronavirus outbreak continued to spread, the impact would be significant, albeit temporary, on the cash flow of Macau&#39;s casinos.

Last Wednesday (Feb 19), Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat told Bloomberg TV in an interview that the Government has no plans to ease property cooling measures. \n \u201cIt is not on our radar at this point because we need to make sure that we stabilise the economy and we address long term structural issues,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u00a0 \n This is understandable given that the Covid-19 outbreak has led to a percentage point downgrade in the official forecast of Singapore\u2019s economic growth this year. \n At the same time, the outbreak will also have an adverse impact on the private residential market, with spillover effects on the entire real estate value chain and the longer-term stability of the property market.\u00a0 \n Why is this so? \n Let\u2019s take a look at where the market stands today as well as cooling measures such as the Additional Buyer\u2019s Stamp Duty (ABSD). \n Currently, developers now must build and sell all their units in a project within five years to get a remission of the ABSD on the land purchase price. \n Otherwise they will have to pay the 25 per cent ABSD, with interest. \n ABSD was 10 per cent when it was introduced in Dec 2011, before it was\u00a0raised to 15 per cent in July 2013 and the current 25 per cent in July 2018. \n In 2020, developers are going to launch some 10,402 units from 48 projects, based on Cushman & Wakefield Research\u2019s estimate. Of these, 4,765 units or 46 per cent will come from the luxury segment or the Core Central Region (CCR) segment. \n Traditionally, about 28 per cent of the buyers of CCR homes are permanent residents and foreigners from China, which has been hard hit by the Covid-19 outbreak. \n Singapore has since banned travellers who have visited mainland China recently, and the majority of that includes Chinese passport holders who could be the potential buyers of these luxury units. In 2019, non-PR China buyers bought a total of 359 units, of which 141 units were in the CCR. \n At a broader level, demand for private residential units might slow to a trickle soon, judging from the market reactions in our neighbouring countries affected by Covid-19. \n As an indication of how far sales could fall, China home sales plunged by 90 per cent in the first week of February compared to the same period in 2019, according to preliminary data on 36 cities compiled by China Merchants Securities Co.\u00a0 \n Before the virus outbreak, the Singapore market was already expecting a more challenging sales environment in the coming months due to resistance to high prices and launch fatigue especially for smaller developments. The mood is now more bearish due to the virus outbreak. \n The temporary shortage of labour will also have an impact on the property market. \n Construction companies have expressed concerns about failing to meet deadlines due to workers from China not being able to return to Singapore and quarantine orders placed on affected workers in the industry. \n The authorities have urged developers not to penalise contractors and subcontractors for the unexpected delays. \n Beyond a temporary labour shortage, construction companies face a bigger and complex challenge arising from the global supply chain disruption caused by the lock-down in many China cities, with factories remaining shut or operating with reduced capacity. \n In Singapore, construction material and finished products are not expected to arrive in time for assembly or use. As manufacturers in China and the entire world are so interdependent, it is hard to predict how soon manufacturing would resume and at what capacity. \n What has made the situation more dire for Singapore construction firms is the mandatory adoption of the pre-fabricated pre-finished volumetric construction (PPVC) method at many Government Land Sales sites. \n Modern construction technology such as PPVC requires all components to be assembled off-site before they are delivered to the project site under construction. These include door, glass panels, tiles, sanitary ware etc. It does not allow construction to proceed if there is just one missing item. \n Although the current supply chain disruption would likely impact all stages of construction, the impact on PPVC construction would be more pronounced. \n The construction delay and the ripple effect beyond the short to medium term could have serious repercussions on the already fragile residential market. \n In about two to three years\u2019 time, the Singapore residential market could deal with a supply overhang arising from the enbloc boom between 2017 and 2018. \n At the same time, all developers are bound by a five-year ABSD remission deadline that is fast approaching amid slower sales. \n On the supply front, there are 49,173 uncompleted private residential units (excluding executive condominiums) with planning approval. \n Of this, 30,162 remain unsold. There are also an additional 4,575 private residential units that do not have planning approval yet. \n Based on the 9,912 units sold in 2019, it should take developers roughly about five years to clear the existing stock and narrowly escape the ABSD penalty, assuming sales momentum in 2019 can be maintained this year. \n Looking at how things are now, it is unlikely that developers will be able to sell their projects at the same pace as previously anticipated.\u00a0 \n In short, they could be hit with a double whammy \u2013 construction delays and potentially missing the ABSD deadline due to unforeseen circumstances which are no fault of theirs. \n Developers could slash prices drastically to try to move units but this could have a destabilising effect on the market as a whole. \n It is still fairly early days and how long the outbreak will last and how exactly it will affect the broader economy and the property market is still unclear.\u00a0 \n But if the outbreak worsens, there is a case to be made for the authorities to extend the current ABSD deadline. \n The point is not only to provide much needed relief for developers, but to cushion the impact on the property sector. \n As it is, the current ABSD rule is too blunt a tool, as it does not differentiate the larger projects of hundreds or even thousands of units, from the smaller ones. \n As the economy is expected to head south, the larger projects have a much higher chance of missing the deadline, as they typically require a much longer time to sell out all the units especially during challenging times like now. \n An extension of the ABSD deadline would help developers to stagger new home sales and manage risks better arising from supply overhang. \n It would go a long way to help the market, long after the virus blows over, to avert a worst-case scenario that housing units are dumped in the open market in a disorderly manner, hurting both\u00a0consumers and the economy. \n \u00a0 \n ABOUT THE AUTHOR: \n Christine Li is head of research for Singapore and Southeast Asia at global property consultancy Cushman & Wakefield."}, {"content": "World should learn lessons from China in coronavirus fight - China Daily.

SINGAPORE \u2014 The Singapore stock market on Monday (March 9) suffered its largest single-day drop since October 2008, as markets around the globe were battered following\u00a0a plunge in oil prices that\u00a0fuelled rising alarm over the economic impact of Covid-19. \n After weeks of slow and gradual decline, the benchmark Straits Times Index (STI)\u00a0nosedived 6 per cent \u2014\u00a0shedding 178.61 points to 2,782.37. \n It was the worst fall since the height of the global financial crisis and dragged the main market index to its lowest levels since 2016. \n The massive selloff across the globe was triggered by a plunge in\u00a0oil prices after the world\u2019s major oil producers failed to reach an agreement on cutting production, which sparked a price-cutting war in an environment where supply is exceeding waning demand. \n Among many global losers, Japan\u2019s Nikkei sank 5 per cent and Australia\u2019s ASX 200 dived 7.3 per cent. \n Market experts in Singapore warned investors not to take their chances during such turbulent times, and to leave the analysis and guesswork to the professionals. \n The STI, an index which tracks the performance of the top 30 companies listed on the Singapore Exchange, saw all three banks here \u2014 DBS, OCBC and UOB \u2014 fall by at least 6 per cent. Conglomerate Keppel Corp tanked by almost 10 per cent, Genting Singapore dropped 6 per cent and Singapore Airlines was down 4.5 per cent. \n Analysts warned investors against thinking that this might sound like a good time to enter the stock market and pick up some bargains among blue chips. \n They said that\u00a0this is a time to be extra cautious because the confluence of factors that are causing the current market carnage is unprecedented, and there is no knowing how long the market bloodshed will last. \n WHY DID THE MARKET PLUNGE? \n The plunge in the STI, experts told TODAY, was largely due to a meeting of two \u201cblack swans\u201d\u2014 an oil price war and an airline industry robbed of demand from the Covid-19 outbreak. A black swan event is one that comes as a complete surprise and has\u00a0deep consequences. \n On Friday, Russia refused to join the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) in a large production cut as the Covid-19 outbreak continues to slow the global economy along with the demand for oil, the New York Times reported. \n In retaliation, Saudi Arabia decided to cut oil prices by nearly 10 per cent on Saturday. \n Price wars such as\u00a0these have led to steep falls in oil prices before, as in 2016. However, experts said\u00a0that with the Covid-19 outbreak looming in the background, there are no \u201cwinners\u201d in this situation. \n Mr Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB Private Banking, said that when there is a sharp fall in oil prices, there will normally be winners and losers, but in this instance, it is a \u201closer-loser\u201d situation. \n \u201cNormally, the airline industry has been the primary beneficiary of such a sharp plunge in oil prices. Now, no one wants to take (a plane). \n \u201cHad it just been the oil price war without the coronavirus outbreak fears, we would all be travelling to Japan for S$1 priced tickets. But now, even with that pricing, we would be scared to go,\u201d he said. \n Ms Pan Jingyi, a market strategist at brokerage firm IG, said that besides the fall in oil prices, the increase in the number of infections outside of China has caused negative sentiment in the market. \n This is due to the growth in Covid-19 cases in countries such as Iran, Italy and South Korea, where case numbers have spiked from the tens to the thousands in the span of weeks. \n \u201cThe backdrop still being the coronavirus impact\u00a0that\u2019s causing quite a lot of turmoil in the market,\u201d she said. \u201cThe hit on demand is already the general situation in the market, and the market has processed that in.\u201d \n WHAT SHOULD INVESTORS DO? \n Mr Terence Wong, chief executive officer of fund management\u00a0company Azure Capital, said that due to the \u201cmany unknowns out there\u201d, punters should not be investing \u201caggressively\u201d at the moment. \n \u201cIt could have other impacts on other parts of the economy that you may not think about,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you asked me last week, I couldn\u2019t tell that this would happen\u2026 There will be a high degree of risk (to invest) right now.\u201d \n Agreeing, Mr Song said that investment during such dire circumstances should be left to the professionals. \n \u201cWe have the virus outbreak plus a price war, I don\u2019t think laymen are equipped to deal with this kind of fluid landscape,\u201d he said. \n Though the experts generally warned against investing during this period of turmoil, there could be a sliver of opportunity for those willing to take the risk. \n If one had to choose certain industries to invest in, it should be more stable\u00a0industries such as primarily consumer staples, which includes producers of food, household goods and other essentials, Ms Pan said. \n Mr Song added that the healthcare sector, especially health care services and medical equipment manufacturers, are set to do well during this period. \n A larger risk would be to invest in cyclical stocks, those that are tied to the business cycle, Ms Pan said. These include companies in the industrial sector or those that deal with energy production. \n WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THE STOCK MARKET \n The rate at which the market will recover depends not just on the spread of the virus, but the fear among the population, the\u00a0analysts\u00a0said. \n Mr Wong of Azure Capital believes that the market will recover when the number of cases stabilises. Now that the number of cases is still \u201cjumping around\u201d, this will cause uncertainty in the market, he said. \n \u201cIf you look at China, the number of new cases has already been decreasing,\u201d he said. \u201cIf, globally, we didn\u2019t see wild numbers\u2026 I think we could have already made a recovery in the market.\u201d \n Mr Song agreed that consumer fears play a bigger role in curbing demand than the actual number of cases does. \n \u201c(Chances of a rebound) depends on how confident market participants are about the outbreak being contained, the most important being the fear factor,\u201d he said. \n However, when a rebound will come is hard to tell, which makes it difficult to know when one should start investing again. \n Ms Pan said: \u201cWith every market shock, there will be a recovery, but the problem this time is that we are dealing with something that is very uncertain (with the) coronavirus. Perhaps we will need to see a vaccine come through, to be a remedy (to the economy).\u201d \n In the meantime, players in the market can only hope that the worst will be over soon, but there is no indication of how big the hit on the market will continue to be, or how long it will last. \n The analysts said that they expect the STI to fall further to around 2,500-point levels, down from the current 2,782. \n In the last\u00a0five years,\u00a0STI closed at its lowest of\u00a02,539 points in February 2016. \n Mr Wong said that\u00a0it is ultimately wiser to hold off investing during\u00a0an uncertain economy rather than hope to profit from it. \n \u201cYou can see the tide coming, but you can\u2019t tell how big it\u2019s going to be,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s a ripple, that\u2019s fine. But what if it builds up to a tsunami wave? \n \u201cThere\u2019s no need to be a hero\u2026 I still think that cash (rather than investments) will be king right now.\u201d"}, {"content": "WRAPUP 4-U.S. could be next 'virus epicentre', as India locks down, global recession looms.

They become active only when they come into contact with living cells, which they then try to hijack to produce more viruses. \n Even so, viruses are made of biological material and have the biggest population of any biological entity on earth, triggering responses in living things that range from unnoticeable reactions to death. \n Some experts believe that nearly 10 per cent of the current human genome is viral genetic material, as a result of viruses infecting human cells for millennia. \n They belong to a large group of viruses that usually\u00a0infect only animals, and are so named for the crown-like spikes on their surface. \n But from the mid-1960s, scientists began identifying coronaviruses that affect humans, with seven types of these viruses classified to date, according to the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. \n Four of these typically cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses like the common cold, with well-known symptoms such as sore throats, cough, and headaches. \n But the remaining three have more recently caused severe repercussions on human health as scientists scrambled to understand them. \n The first is the infectious\u00a0severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) coronavirus, which killed almost 800 people in 32 countries 17 years ago. \n The other two are the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Mers-CoV), which was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and later spread further, and the latest Wuhan virus (2019-nCov)\u00a0which killed its first victims in the Chinese city of Wuhan. \n Scientists have speculated that the virus from the latest Wuhan outbreak, like the Mers and Sars viruses that preceded it, evolved from coronavirus strains that previously affected only animals. \n This ability of a virus to \"jump\" from animals to humans is not unusual and has given rise to a category of illnesses called zoonotic diseases, which also counts among its ranks diseases caused by non-coronavirus viruses like the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Ebola. \n Zoonotic viruses generally have a single strand of genetic material called RNA, which is more easily copied or mutated than humans' double-stranded DNA, which accounts for their virality. \n To date, the Wuhan coronavirus has been closely linked to Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, which reportedly also peddled live animals like deer and animal parts in addition to seafood. \n Scientists have said such \"unnatural situations\", where animals are brought together and often housed in bad conditions in close proximity to people, create opportunities for viruses to hop between animals. The virus could then have changed so that it is able to infect humans and eventually start spreading between people. \n Every virus typically infects a certain type of living host organism, said Dr Sebastian Maurer-Stroh, deputy executive director of research at the Agency for Science, Technology and Research's (A*Star) Bioinformatics Institute. \n \"Viruses can shift their host preference through mutations... Some viruses mutate much faster,\" he added. \n The Wuhan coronavirus is understood to spread much like the common flu does - through the air when an infected person coughs, through close contact such as shaking hands with an infected person, or touching an object with the virus on it before touching one's mouth and eyes. \n For now, virologists have said that the Wuhan coronavirus - based on reported rates of infection - is likely not as infectious as the Sars virus. But there are concerns that the Wuhan virus' current reported 2 per cent death rate - two out of 100 infected people die - is not representative and that the virus could further mutate to become more lethal. \n Dr Michael Wong, a senior family physician at Raffles Medical, said the virulence of the Wuhan virus cannot be underestimated. \u201cWith mutations, the virus could increase in virulence and transmissibility, leading to a serious pandemic,\u201d he said. \n The Chinese government has classified the Wuhan virus outbreak in the same category as the Sars epidemic, meaning compulsory isolation for those diagnosed with the illness and the potential to implement quarantine measures on travel, said Dr Wong. \n There are also worries that the number of infections is yet under-reported, with many brushing off symptoms as those of the common flu. \n It is a different strain and, for now, has reported a lower fatality rate than the Sars virus. \n The World Health Organisation estimates that the overall fatality rate for Sars patients to be between 14 per cent and 15 per cent, while that for Wuhan is currently at 2 per cent. \n Researchers have said that the Wuhan virus shares only 76 per cent of its genetic material with the Sars virus - a big difference in genetic terms much like \"comparing a dog and a cat\". \n There is, however, speculation that both viruses originated from bats. Recent reports have also suggested that the Wuhan virus might be linked to snakes too. \n No, said professor Paul Tambyah, from the department of medicine at NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine. \n \u201cI don\u2019t think we should panic as panic is never a good approach.\u201d \n Instead, we should be concerned. \n He said there are measures in place to control the outbreak here and elsewhere. The public should be concerned and thus be vigilant about maintaining good hand hygiene, seeking medical attention if unwell and staying home, he said. \n Wear a surgical mask when you have a cold or flu, to prevent the transmission of airborne germs. \n Some doctors have been wearing surgical masks as a precautionary measure at work, so some people may\u00a0wonder if they should dig out their N95 masks too. \n But\u00a0there is no need to, said professor Leo Yee Sin, the executive director of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. Instead, they should wear surgical masks.\u00a0 \n \u201cN95 masks are of a very special design. They are very difficult to breathe in. If you find the N95 mask easy to breathe in and comfortable, you are wearing it wrong and it\u2019s no use,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s only when it is difficult to breathe that you are wearing it correctly.\u201d \n It is thus not recommended for the general public, she said. \n In fact, if you use it wrongly, it may make things worse because you think you are protected when you are not, she said. \n Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital said that everyone with respiratory symptoms must wear masks, now that there\u2019s human to human transmission. \n The MOH on Thursday said Singaporeans should avoid travelling to Wuhan, stepping up a notch from its advice on Wednesday for people to\u00a0defer non-essential travel there. \n The ministry said it updated the travel advisory \"in view of the\u00a0developing novel coronavirus\u00a0situation in Wuhan and other parts of China\", with confirmed cases spreading beyond Wuhan to Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Guangdong, which abuts densely populated Hong Kong. \n It also cited the travel halt imposed by the Chinese authorities on Thursday, as all flights out of the city were cancelled and trains, buses and ferries suspended. \n The MOH\u00a0reminded\u00a0the public to continue to exercise caution and pay attention to personal hygiene when travelling to the rest of China. \n All travellers should monitor their health closely for two weeks upon returning to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell, and also inform their doctor of their travel history, said the ministry. \n If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms like a cough or runny nose, they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of the visit. \n Singapore is stepping up precautionary measures, in anticipation of more travellers in the lead-up to the Chinese New Year holidays. \n The expanded measures include temperature screening for all travellers arriving from China \u2013 not just Wuhan alone \u2013 at Changi Airport from Wednesday\u00a0and issuing health advisory notices to them. \n \u201cHowever, people who are in the incubation period \u2013 likely seven to 14 days based on known characteristics of other corona viruses \u2013 might not have started showing symptoms such as a fever, and, hence, not be detected by the thermal scanners,\u201d said Raffles Medical\u2019s Dr Wong. \n \u201cWith increased awareness of the infection, it is hoped that those who experience symptoms would isolate themselves and see a doctor as soon as possible so as to prevent spreading the infection.\u201d \n There is no specific treatment to cure illnesses caused by human coronaviruses, including pneumonia caused by the Wuhan virus. \n Patients typically recover on their own after some time by depending on their immune system to fight the infection. \n Treatment mostly involves tackling flu-like symptoms from infections and making patients more comfortable, such as providing them with breathing apparatus to help with breathing difficulties. \n In some cases, antiviral drugs are available to shorten the duration or reduce the severity of the illness by decreasing the ability of the coronavirus to reproduce, effectively isolating it. \n A*Star's Dr Maurer-Stroh said that \"as a rule of thumb, a virus that spreads widely is often less severe\". \n A flu vaccine will not help protect you against the Wuhan coronavirus. There is no vaccine to protect against coronaviruses. The influenza virus, that a flu jab protects against, is not a coronavirus. \n However, according to an advisory from Raffles Medical, you should still get a flu jab if you are travelling to exposed areas to prevent you from contracting influenza symptoms and signs that may mislead screening authorities at temperature checkpoints."}, {"content": "Beijing quarantines returning residents as China struggles to pick up economy.

A research error by the authors of a short article published in letter form by the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) last Thursday has fueled scientific debate on one of the key unresolved questions of the epidemic of the disease. Wuhan coronavirus: whether asymptomatic patients can transmit the disease. The letter claimed that a Chinese worker in the automotive sector had spread the disease to two colleagues - and one of them to two others - at the company&#39;s German headquarters during a training course. &quot;During her stay, she had been fine and without symptoms of the infection, but she became ill during the flight back to China,&quot; the researchers published. The authors, however, had not spoken to the woman. One of them, Michael Hoelscher, from the University of Munich hospital, explained to the magazine Science that it was the infected colleagues who explained to them that this &quot;did not seem to have any symptoms&quot; \u00b7 The German public health agency, the Robert Institute Koch did, later, and the woman explained that she had felt &quot;tired, with muscle aches and had taken paracetamol&quot;, an antipyretic, during her stay in Europe. This has led the Institute to send a letter to the NEJM requesting a correction of the article and to inform the World Health Organization (WHO) and other European agencies about the new findings. The article had a great impact on the scientific community since it was the first published in a prestigious magazine that confirmed the progress made by the Chinese Minister of Health, Ma Xiaowei, on Sunday, January 26: that people who developed the disease could transmit the virus for days before showing the first symptoms. &quot;There is no doubt after reading the article that transmission from asymptomatic patients is occurring,&quot; said Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Infectious Diseases and Allergies. Large media around the world, including EL PA\u00cdS, also echoed what was published by NEJM due to its relevance. Despite what happened with NEJM, Fauci is convinced that infections from asymptomatic people are occurring. &quot;I have called one of my colleagues in China, who is a highly respected scientist in health matters, and he told me that he is convinced that some people are asymptomatically developing the infection and that some asymptomatic infected are transmitting the disease&quot; , Fauci has explained to the journal Science. The possibility that asymptomatic patients can spread the coronavirus alerts experts to the difficulties that this would entail in controlling the spread of the pathogen. It would force, for example, to extend the contact studies of patients diagnosed to the days before the symptoms develop and it would reduce the usefulness of control measures adopted at many airports, such as monitoring body temperature. That the incubation periods \u2014when a patient already has the virus but still does not suffer symptoms\u2014 and transmission \u2014when they are capable of transmitting it\u2014 overlap a few days is not uncommon in infectious diseases, including respiratory ones. For this reason, doctors and scientists wait almost from the first phases of the Wuhan epidemic for information and studies that shed light on whether this occurs. &quot;It is something that would increase uncertainty about the effect of some of the prevention measures adopted,&quot; Jes\u00fas Rodr\u00edguez Ba\u00f1o, head of the infectious diseases service at the Virgen Macarena Hospital (Seville), explained to this newspaper last Friday. \u201cThe detection of asymptomatic cases will have implications when we know if this always happens or only in some cases. Several unknowns remain to be resolved, \u201dadded the doctor from the international health service of the Hospital Cl\u00ednic de Barcelona and an ISGlobal researcher. Both researchers agree that the question remains unanswered. Although they emphasize that &quot;in any case, the expansion of the coronavirus is mainly due to patients who are already sick and if the transmissions in asymptomatic patients exist, they have a secondary role in the evolution of the outbreak.&quot; In its daily report on the evolution of the epidemic, the WHO said last Saturday that it has news of &quot;the possible transmission of 2019-nCoV&quot;, the provisional name given to the pathogen, &quot;from some infected people before they develop symptoms.&quot; The agency referred to ongoing investigations &quot;to better understand the preclinical phases of infection and how transmissions may have occurred.&quot; In any case, the WHO also maintains that this type of infection &quot;does not appear to be an important route of transmission of the virus.&quot;"}, {"content": "Covid-19.

What is alarming is that the pandemic is accelerating in many countries.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) fears that after Europe, the United States is on the course of becoming the next hotspot of Covid-19. India is among the countries that are being anxiously followed by WHO and others.\nTo understand how grave the situation of novel coronavirus spread is, let us check the numbers of its progression globally. On December 31, China informed the WHO about cases of pneumonia due to some mysterious ailment in Wuhan city. There have been reports, however, about a viral outbreak in Wuhan.\nOn January 5, China ruled out a coronavirus outbreak saying it was not a SARS virus recurrence (sever acute respiratory syndrome), an illness that had turned epidemic after its outbreak in China and Hong Kong in 2002.\nTwo days later on January 7, China announced having identified the virus as novel coronavirus - 2019-nCoV. On January 11, China reported first death due to novel coronavirus infection in Wuhan. Second death was reported on January 17.\nBetween two novel coronavirus deaths, Covid-19 cases were reported from Thailand and Japan. Soon countries including South Korea, the US, France, Australia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan and Nepal reported cases of novel coronavirus infection. But all cases were traced to infection in China.\nOn January 31, the WHO declared novel coronavirus outbreak an \"international emergency\" recognizing it as a risk to other countries. China had by then report nearly 9,700 cases and 213 deaths due to novel coronavirus.\nThe disease was spreading fast but it accelerated after it reached 1 lakh-mark globally. The WHO said it took 67 days for Covid-19 outbreak to infect first 1 lakh patients on March 7.\nBut to infect another 1 lakh people, the coronavirus took just 12 days. On March 19, the numbers crossed 2 lakh. During this phase, the daily count of fresh novel coronavirus cases kept rising consistently barring on a few days. (See table below)\nThe next 1 lakh patients got Covid-19 in just four days, with global count crossing 3 lakh on March 23. On March 25, the WHO count for global Covid-19 patients crossed 4 lakh. It means the last 1 lakh novel coronavirus patients were added to the list in just two days.\nTotal deaths as on March 25 due to Covid-19 stood at 18,440 with more than 2200 losing the battle against novel coronavirus in the last 24 hours, according to WHO report.\nNow compare this trend with the trend in India.\nIndia reported its first Covid-19 case on January 30. It was the same day that the WHO declared novel coronavirus a global emergency.\nBy February 3, there were three cases in India.\nOn February 20, all three Covid-19 patients were discharged after they recovered from infection.\nBy February 28, India had tested 2,880 samples, of which 1,572 were samples from outside quarantine centres. Only three had tested positive.\nMarch 2, two cases were reported - one each from Delhi and Hyderabad.\nOn March 10, the Covid-19 cases reached 50 and on March 15 it crossed 100-mark (107). On March 20 - with 50 new cases - novel coronavirus cases jumped to 223. That is, India reported 105 cases in 13 days between March 2 and 5. But in just next five days, the country recorded 118 more cases.\nIn another four days, the number crossed 500 on March 24, when official number of Covid-19 patients was 519. That is, India saw almost 300 fresh cases after it breached 200-mark.\nAt noon on March 26, the official data put the number of Covid-19 patients at 649, 593 of them being active cases treated in different hospitals. That is, in 15 days (March 11-26), coronavirus cases in India increased nearly 13 times.\nThe official death count due to novel coronavirus infection stood at 13 while 42 Covid-19 have been cured and discharged from hospitals.\nClearly, India is following the same pattern as other novel coronavirus-affected countries across continents. The only relief here is that the number is not phenomenal given India's proximity to China and its huge population base.

LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - The language commonly used to describe speculative manias is borrowed from epidemiology. A new technology sparks \u201ccontagion\u201d. Investors are \u201cinfected\u201d with greed. Speculative \u201cfever\u201d breaks out. During the panic phase, contagion becomes more \u201cvirulent\u201d. After the South Sea Bubble collapsed 300 years ago, contemporary observers likened the market situation to a plague. In fact, by late 1720 the bubonic plague was spreading across Europe. Today, the world is faced with another epidemic. The response to coronavirus resembles the inverse of a speculative mania, with fear replacing greed, and errors of pessimism those of optimism.\nIn his engaging and eerily well-timed new book, \u201cThe Rules of Contagion\u201d, Adam Kucharski observes that bubbles and diseases go through similar growth phases. Both experience periods of exponential growth. Eventually the spread peaks, the bubble bursts and the number of infections declines sharply. A typical outbreak chart resembles an inverted \u201cV\u201d. Bubbles follow a similar trajectory.\u00a0As the ecologist Robert May observed in 2013, \u201cthe recent rise in financial assets and the subsequent crash have rather precisely the same shape as the typical rise and fall of cases in an outbreak of measles or other infections.\u201d\nFinancial bubbles and epidemics are both prone to cross borders. In 1720, the genie of speculation jumped from Paris to London, and later spread as far as Portugal and Russia. In the early months of 2020, Covid-19 was carried from Wuhan, China to much of the rest of the world. Bubbles produce unreal times: rumours abound and bizarre promotions are launched. Speculators snapped up shares 300 years ago in a company \u201cfor the immediate, expeditious and cleanly manner of emptying necessary houses [toilets] throughout England.\u201d Their descendants have lately taken to stockpiling toilet rolls, a product that England still produces in ample quantity. In an atmosphere of dread, gossip and tall tales spread more virulently than the virus itself.\nBubbles are a form of social contagion. When the markets are soaring, \u201cfear of missing out\u201d drives investors. They lose the capacity to make reasoned judgments. Herd-like behaviour and groupthink prevail. Bullish narratives proliferate. It\u2019s not just that speculators want to hear such stories: Wall Street is incentivised to circulate them. Optimistic visions are maintained in the face of contradictory evidence. During the late 1990s dotcom boom, for instance, Wall Street claimed that internet traffic was doubling every ten weeks. In fact, as researcher Andrew Odlyzko, now at the University of Minnesota, revealed at the time, traffic was growing one-tenth that fast. This inconvenient finding was ignored, and the investment splurge continued, leading to billions of dollars in misallocated capital and the bankruptcy of numerous telecoms firms, including Worldcom.\nThe coronavirus panic has a familiar ring. Charts of reported Italian deaths rising vertically recall bitcoin\u2019s trajectory a couple of years ago. Friends and contacts have taken to forwarding articles by an alarmist coronavirus commentator (not a professional epidemiologist) who boasts millions of readers and claims that his article is the only thing you\u2019ll ever need to read, and will save lives. It\u2019s impossible to say whether this advice is sound or not. But it certainly feels like the pandemic mirror image to the Wall Street pied pipers, such as Henry Blodget, who loudly played their tunes during the internet bubble.\nTrust the experts, we are told: Follow the data and science. If only things were that simple. During the internet and real estate bubbles, financial experts were wrong. A top hedge fund manager once complained to me that \u201cevery bubble has an academic shill.\u201d Epidemiology, like finance, is as much art as science. A colleague and I once gathered data on every bubble we could find. Each one turned out to be different. Epidemiologists face the same problem \u2013 as they like to joke, \u201cif you\u2019ve seen one pandemic, you\u2019ve seen\u2026 one pandemic.\u201d\nBoth investors and epidemiologists face chronic uncertainty. During an epidemic, the data is always changing. Differences in climate and social behavior affect the spread of disease across geographies. This poses enormous challenges when trying to model a pandemic. Like investment strategists, epidemiologists are prone to egregious forecasting errors. In September 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention forecast 1.4 million cases of Ebola in West Africa by the following January. In the end, this epidemic produced fewer than a reported 30,000 cases. An earlier CDC model anticipated a potential smallpox outbreak would result in 77 trillion deaths \u2013 as Kucharski says, both models included an unlimited number of susceptible people.\nCovid-19\u2019s true infection rate is unknown, as outside of South Korea testing has been inadequate and no antibody test is yet available. China cannot be trusted to provide accurate data. As for the fatality rate, Italians may be recording deaths due to coronavirus when other illnesses may also be prevalent. Last week Imperial College predicted more than 2 million people would die in the United States and half a million in the United Kingdom if Covid-19 was not suppressed. Imperial\u2019s dire warning persuaded the U.S. and UK governments into draconian action, shuttering large swathes of the economy. On Monday, Boris Johnson locked down Great Britain.\nYet the assumptions in Imperial\u2019s model \u2013 the reproduction rate, fatality rate, etc. \u2013 are at best educated guesses. The model\u2019s predictions must be hugely sensitive to slight changes in a variety of inputs. Even Imperial admits that what it calls \u201cconservative\u201d assumptions are pessimistic. Such pessimism, or call it excessive caution, appears to be the institutional bias of epidemiologists, just as finance types are prone to hyper-optimism.\nDissenting forces can be heard through the noise. Stanford University epidemiologist John Ioannidis states that analysis of the outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship suggests the virus is much less of a danger to life than commonly assumed. Also drawing on the cruise experience, Michael Levitt, the Stanford biophysicist and Nobel laureate, makes a similar point. \u201cWhat we need to control is the panic,\u201d Levitt told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be fine.\u201d\nThis calls to mind Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s words to the American people in his first inaugural address at the depth of the Great Depression in 1933: \u201cThe only thing we have to fear is... fear itself \u2013 nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyses needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.\u201d When the history of this pandemic is written, it may become a postscript to the ever-expanding volume, \u201cExtraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds\u201d, first published in 1841."}, {"content": "Sensex rises by 227 pts, Nifty back at 12,200.

Even his death seems to have been the subject of manipulation in the end: the doctor Li Wenliang was one of the first to warn his compatriots about the new corona virus. The police silenced him, calling him a &quot;rumor-spreader&quot;. Then Li developed the lung disease himself. The doctor died on Friday night local time in Wuhan. China&#39;s social media are now speculating that the authorities stopped Li&#39;s doctors on rescue operations well after midnight in order to pretend he was still alive - although according to reports, Li&#39;s heart stopped beating at 9:30 p.m. on Thursday evening. An unreal spectacle took place on the Internet for hours: the party-loyal Global Times reported Li&#39;s death around half past ten. Millions of Chinese people expressed their shock. The World Health Organization expressed its condolences on Twitter. Then the news spread that Li was still alive. Or not? After midnight, reporters said that Li passed away at 12:04 am. The Wuhan Xinhua Hospital denied it. Finally, the authorities reported that Li Wenliang died at 2:58 a.m. At the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organization WHO an accumulation of pneumonia of unknown cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Just a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days later, a group led by virologist Christian Drosten from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers are provisionally calling 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. The Chinese authorities suspect the source of the pathogen to be a food market in Wuhan, where not only fish and seafood but also exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected. Both Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic in 2002 and 2003, around 8,000 people were infected and more than 750 died. Between its discovery in 2012 and the end of 2019, around 2,500 people were infected with the Mers virus, and every third person died from it. In total, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example. Several thousand people have now become ill in China, some of them - most of them probably with previous illnesses - died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first cases of infection outside of China became known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been to Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who was returning from Wuhan, and on January 24, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia, which can be fatal. Since it is a viral disease, antibiotics won&#39;t help. It is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after a dozen or so cases among medical personnel became known. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. As it announced on January 24, the World Health Organization currently expects that an infected person will infect an average of 1.4 to 2.5 other people. If these numbers prove to be true, the virus is less contagious than Sars and so is the flu. The WHO recommends following general hygiene rules: You should wash your hands often and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals. It is not yet possible to say with certainty. The World Health Organization announced on January 28th that around a fifth of the reported cases would become seriously ill from the virus, so if in doubt they would have to be treated in intensive care. According to reports, the first fatalities were patients, some of whom had serious previous illnesses. People with previous illnesses are also particularly at risk from other infectious diseases - such as the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, i.e. change their genetic makeup. That can make them more dangerous to people in the course of an outbreak - but also the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate that is as high as that of the Sars outbreak. Has the government deliberately delayed reporting for hours to prevent outrage on the internet? A smarter strategy would have been to capture him as a hero and blame individual provincial cadres in Wuhan. As it is, however, the disaster for the government in Beijing is perfect: the 34-year-old ophthalmologist Li had already become an icon in the past few weeks. On December 30, 2019, he warned of a new type of pathogen in a chat group. The police went to his home at night and told him to be silent. At the end of January, Li himself tested positive for the coronavirus 2019-nCoV. His wife is expecting a second child. She has also become infected in the meantime. His parents too. Li is one of the youngest deaths in the epidemic. Most of the deceased are much older and mostly had previous illnesses. It is not known whether there were complications in Li&#39;s illness. In mourning over his death, Chinese society is now united as it has not been for many years. Hardly anyone leaves their fate untouched. Li was not a dissident, a troubled intellectual or artist, or a Uyghur in distant Xinjiang. But a young ophthalmologist with a top diploma, middle-class Han Chinese, handsome too. Li was not apart from mainstream society, but in the middle of it. Li is the ideal martyr. &quot;In a healthy society, there shouldn&#39;t be just one type of voice&quot; - Li sent this sentence from his hospital bed a few days ago. It now becomes a beacon. Many mourners had a sleepless night. #I will free opinion was the Weibo hashtag of the hour at 5 a.m. on Friday morning. It was clicked two million times before it disappeared. At six o&#39;clock, #WirwollenPressefreiheit began to trend with three million clicks. This hashtag was also deleted. The wave of anger and sadness on social media is unbroken. People from all over the country are posting candle pictures and drawings of Li using barbed wire as a face mask - censorship is easier to circumvent with photos. One commentator wrote: &quot;Li&#39;s death is a day of national shame.&quot; Obituaries describe Li as a buddy next door, someone who went to the ice cream parlor in slippers and was a regular at the popular Haidilao hotpot chain. Everyone in China can identify with him. A nightmare for the communist leadership. Because there is hardly anything that Beijing&#39;s autocrats fear as much as the death of a hero. Chinese history gives enough reason for this: in 1913 an assassination attempt on the founder of the Kuomintang party sparked a revolt against the president. In 1976, people took the death of Prime Minister Zhou Enlais as an opportunity to rebel against the Gang of Four, the group of functionaries from the left wing of the state party who already exercised power alongside Mao Zedong. And in 1989, the commemoration of the popular General Secretary Hu Yaobang led to the Tiananmen Student Movement. The Chinese color of mourning, white, has repeatedly become the color of protests. Beijing has now responded to the outrage on the Internet: A party committee is to investigate the questions of the population about the Li Wenliang case, it is said. This should not appease many: &quot;Remember the anger you feel today&quot; is an appeal that is now going viral.

The Wuhan coronavirus (2019-nCov) is spreading rapidly in Southeast Asia. With more than fifty confirmed cases to date, it is the worst affected region in the world. But not all neighboring countries, most with precarious health systems and highly dependent on Chinese tourism and investment, have reacted with haste. The situation in places like Thailand, the most affected country after the second world economy with 19 infections, especially triggers the alarms. For its part, the Philippines announced on Sunday the first death outside the Asian power: a 44-year-old Chinese man. &quot;Although the numbers (of infections) outside China are relatively low, there is potential for a much larger outbreak,&quot; warned the director general of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, declaring the international emergency on Thursday. due to the expansion of the coronavirus, which as of February 2 leaves a balance of 304 deaths and more than 14,000 infected worldwide. A decision largely grounded, he explained, in the need to protect those countries that &quot;do not have the means to control them.&quot; Southeast Asia is a key area in this regard. But while the declaration of the emergency implies a coordination of the international response within the framework of the WHO, possible new measures could come late in some cases. Thailand already has 19 infections: one of them is a Thai taxi driver who had displaced four other affected people in his vehicle, all from Hubei (province of which Wuhan is the capital, the epicenter of the virus). The local contagion, also occurred in Japan, triggers the Thai authorities&#39; greatest fear: the appearance of outbreaks in places with a large influx of Chinese tourists. &quot;It can start with local transmission and then grow to the provincial level,&quot; warned the deputy director of the Thai Department of Disease Control, Tanarak Plipat. A not-too-distant possibility if one takes into account that, according to the department reported on Thursday, some 10,000 tourists from Wuhan are still in Thailand. China chartered a first flight to repatriate them on Friday. Thailand has received a barrage of public criticism for its management of the crisis, with the hashtag &quot;crapgovernment&quot; (shitty government, in English) sneaking into the most popular on Twitter in recent days. The reason: dissatisfaction with the measures taken by the authorities, who did not begin to install thermographic controls for all flights from China until the middle of last week. For many Internet users, the country would have put preserving the arrival of Chinese tourists before ensuring public health. Thailand, where tourism accounts for between 12% and 20% of GDP, is the number one tourist destination for Chinese abroad. The country estimates losses of between 2,200 million and 2,900 million euros due to the fall in Chinese tourism. In addition to the greater or lesser capacity and willingness to implement control measures, another concern is the precariousness of the health systems of many countries in the region. &quot;We do not know what damage this virus can do if it spreads in a country with a weak health system,&quot; said the WHO director general. Cambodia, one of the poorest countries in Southeast Asia, is a clear example. With a case detected to date, to the country&#39;s sanitary insufficiencies, where Chinese investment has grown exponentially in recent years, another almost more insurmountable obstacle has been added: the reluctance of Hun Sen, its prime minister. &quot;If the prime minister is not wearing a mask, why is he going to wear the rest,&quot; he said this week. Hun Sen, who added that the &quot;real disease is fear,&quot; ruled out canceling flights from China so as not to harm the ailing national economy. Geography is another risk factor. The land borders of the countries in this region that border China (Vietnam, with three infected, and Myanmar and Laos, currently free of the pathogen) remain open, unlike Russia, which decreed its closure on Thursday. Indonesia, an archipelago of more than 17,000 islands, keeps two possible infected under observation and claims to have increased controls at its countless entry points. For its part, although the prosperous Singapore has been the first country in Southeast Asia to impose the most drastic measures to curb the spread of the virus, banning entry to all travelers who have been to China in the last two weeks, cases are growing daily, hitting 18 on February 2. Two of the infected are Singaporean women who were repatriated from Wuhan last Thursday. Until a few days ago free of the pathogen, the Philippines was the first country outside of China to register a death due to the coronavirus: a 44-year-old Chinese citizen who had arrived from Wuhan with his wife, also infected. At the moment they are the only two cases in this country, which hours before the death was confirmed announced the ban on all travel from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macao. With China as the main source of tourists for most of Southeast Asia, restrictions on the entry of citizens of this country deal a severe blow to their economies. Malaysia, where there are eight infected, has rejected a controversial popular request to ban all Chinese citizens from entering. Tourism has thus become a double-edged sword for Southeast Asia. Although it is estimated that it is the main source of contagion, with the Chinese traveling up to ten times more abroad than in 2003, according to the consultancy Capital Economics - in the middle of the SARS epidemic, another coronavirus that emerged then in China - the importance of the sector in the region seems to discourage drastic decision-making."}, {"content": "singapore leaders stand in solidarity with china over covid-19 outbreak.

I am confident that under your able leadership, China will overcome Covid-19 with strength and fortitude,\u201d Mdm\u00a0Halimah said. \n Shortly after the outbreak started\u00a0in Wuhan,\u00a0the Chinese government moved to contain the spread of the virus, such as shutting down transport links in\u00a0and out of the city. It also built hospitals in days to treat patients. \n \u201cWe have seen how speedily China has mobilised itself to contain the spread, and implemented practical measures to help people affected, both in Wuhan and the rest of China,\u201d Mr Lee wrote\u00a0in his letter to Mr Xi. \n \"We applaud China\u2019s firm and decisive response, and are happy to see early indications that it is beginning to bring the outbreak under control. \n \"I am confident that with your leadership, and the support of the Chinese people and the international community, China will succeed in this urgent task.\" \n INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION \n During the lockdown, several nations, including Singapore,\u00a0airlifted its citizens back to their home countries. \n \u201cI would also like to express my appreciation to the Chinese government \u2013 in particular the Hubei government \u2013 for its facilitation of Singapore\u2019s efforts to repatriate our nationals and their dependents from Hubei,\u201d wrote Mdm Halimah. \n \u201cI am also glad that we were able to assist with the repatriation of Chinese nationals in Singapore back to Wuhan. This is a testament to the strong cooperation between our countries.\u201d \n Mr Lee said China and Singapore \"cooperated closely\" on the repatriation of each other's nationals. \n He said Singapore has been affected by the coronavirus and has introduced restrictions and stepped up detection at its borders. \n \"We have implemented strict quarantine procedures. And we have strengthened our healthcare system, to treat and care for those who have contracted the virus. Many Covid-19 patients, including a significant number of Chinese citizens, have recovered well in our hospitals and been discharged,\" he wrote. \n \"Singapore is cooperating with China on multiple levels. Our shared experience fighting the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) in 2003 taught us that countries have to work with one another to deal with a global public health crisis.\" \n The Prime Minister also noted that while there are similarities between Covid-19 and Sars, there are also \"significant differences\".\u00a0 \n \"The scientists report that Covid-19 is probably more infectious than Sars, but less lethal. Consequently, it may take longer to bring under control, and is more likely to become endemic in human populations,\" he said. \n MEDICAL SUPPLIES, DONATIONS \n Mdm Halimah added that the Singapore Government has\u00a0contributed\u00a0medical equipment, supplies and diagnostic test kits for Covid-19, as well as seed money to a humanitarian fund which has already raised more than S$6 million. \n \u201cI hope that our modest contributions have brought some comfort and relief to those affected by the virus,\u201d she said. \n Mr Lee also noted\u00a0that Singapore had responded to China's early request for personal protective equipment, medical supplies and diagnostic test kits. \n Mdm Halimah said international cooperation is \"crucial to effectively combatting Covid-19\". \n \"It is to China\u2019s credit that its willingness to work with the international community has allowed us all, including affected countries like Singapore, to develop test kits and come up with appropriate measures to manage the outbreak together,\" she added. \n Mr Lee said Singapore researchers are ready to collaborate with their Chinese counterparts and share their expertise to work\u00a0towards a vaccine and treatment for the coronavirus. \n \"I am happy that Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat and Vice Premier Han Zheng have agreed to discuss cooperation in the management of public health crises at the\u00a0Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation (JCBC),\" Mr Lee added. \n Singapore is also cooperating on a regional basis with China and other neighbouring countries to counter the outbreak, as seen in the recent\u00a0Special Asean-China Foreign Ministers\u2019 Meeting\u00a0on Covid-19 in Vientiane. \n \u201cEven as countries take strong measures to contain the disease in the early phases, we should begin exploring how over the longer term we can best manage the health effects of the virus on our people, while progressively restoring economic activities and international trade and travel,\u201d said Mr Lee. \n \u201cSingapore has some ideas, which my Foreign Minister Dr Vivian Balakrishnan shared with State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi when they met in Laos last week.

US researchers gave the first shot to the first person in a test of an experimental coronavirus vaccine on Monday -- leading off a worldwide hunt for protection even as the pandemic surges.\nWith a careful jab in a healthy volunteer's arm, scientists at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Research Institute in Seattle begin an anxiously awaited first-stage study of a potential Covid-19 vaccine developed in record time after the new virus exploded from China and fanned across the globe.\n\"We're team coronavirus now,\" Kaiser Permanente study leader Dr. Lisa Jackson said on the eve of the experiment. \"Everyone wants to do what they can in this emergency.\"\nThe Associated Press observed as the study's first participant, an operations manager at a small tech company, received the injection inside an exam room. Three others were next in line for a test that will ultimately give 45 volunteers two doses, a month apart.\n\"We all feel so helpless. This is an amazing opportunity for me to do something,\" Jennifer Haller, 43, of Seattle, said as she awaited the shot.\nShe's the mother of two teenagers and \"they think it's cool\" that she's taking part in the study.\nAfter the injection, she left the exam room with a big smile: \"I'm feeling great.\"\nMonday's milestone marked just the beginning of a series of studies in people needed to prove whether the shots are safe and could work. Even if the research goes well, a vaccine wouldn't be available for widespread use for 12 to 18 months, said Dr. Anthony Fauci of the US National Institutes of Health.\nStill, finding a vaccine \"is an urgent public health priority,\" Fauci said in a statement Monday. The new study, \"launched in record speed, is an important first step toward achieving that goal.\"\nThis vaccine candidate, code-named mRNA-1273, was developed by the NIH and Massachusetts-based biotechnology company Moderna Inc. There's no chance participants could get infected from the shots because they don't contain the coronavirus itself.\nIt's not the only potential vaccine in the pipeline. Dozens of research groups around the world are racing to create a vaccine against Covid-19. Another candidate, made by Inovio Pharmaceuticals, is expected to begin its own safety study -- in the US, China and South Korea -- next month.\nThe Seattle experiment got underway days after the World Health Organization declared the new virus outbreak a pandemic because of its rapid global spread, infecting more than 169,000 people and killing more than 6,500.\nCovid-19 has upended the world's social and economic fabric since China first identified the virus in January, with regions shuttering schools and businesses, restricting travel, canceling entertainment and sporting events, and encouraging people to stay away from each other.\nStarting what scientists call a first-in-humans study is a momentous occasion for scientists, but Jackson described her team's mood as \"subdued.\" They've been working round-the-clock readying the research in a part of the US struck early and hard by the virus.\nStill, \"going from not even knowing that this virus was out there ... to have any vaccine\" in testing in about two months is unprecedented, Jackson told The AP.\nSome of the study's carefully chosen healthy volunteers, ages 18 to 55, will get higher dosages than others to test how strong the inoculations should be. Scientists will check for any side effects and draw blood samples to test if the vaccine is revving up the immune system, looking for encouraging clues like the NIH earlier found in vaccinated mice.\n\"We don't know whether this vaccine will induce an immune response, or whether it will be safe. That's why we're doing a trial,\" Jackson stressed. \"It's not at the stage where it would be possible or prudent to give it to the general population.\"\nMost of the vaccine research under way globally targets a protein aptly named \"spike\" that studs the surface of the new coronavirus and lets it invade human cells. Block that protein and people won't get infected.\nResearchers at the NIH copied the section of the virus' genetic code that contains the instructions for cells to create the spike protein. Moderna encased that \"messenger RNA\" into a vaccine.\nThe idea: The body will become a mini-factory, producing some harmless spike protein. When the immune system spots the foreign protein, it will make antibodies to attack -- and be primed to react quickly if the person later encounters the real virus.\nThat's a much faster way of producing a vaccine than the traditional approach of growing virus in the lab and preparing shots from either killed or weakened versions of it.\nBut because vaccines are given to millions of healthy people, it takes time to test them in large enough numbers to spot an uncommon side effect, cautioned Dr. Nelson Michael of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, which is developing a different vaccine candidate.\n\"The science can go very quickly but, first, do no harm, right?\" he told reporters last week.\nThe Seattle research institute is part of a government network of centers that test all kinds of vaccines, and was chosen for the coronavirus vaccine study before Covid-19 began spreading widely in Washington state.\nKaiser Permanente screened dozens of people, looking for those who have no chronic health problems and aren't currently sick. Researchers aren't checking whether would-be volunteers already had a mild case of Covid-19 before deciding if they're eligible. If some did, scientists will be able to tell by the number of antibodies in their pre-vaccination blood test and account for that, Jackson said. Participants will be paid $100 for each clinic visit in the study."}, {"content": "Coronavirus. Finland confirms the first case of infection with the new coronavirus.

These charges are likely to be waived.\nDemurrage charges are levied by shipping lines on importers when they do not take delivery of the full container and move it out of the port or the terminal area within the permissible number of free days.\nHowever, with China on shutdown mode, many companies are looking at India as an alternative destination.\n\u201cSome 10-12 companies, among those searching for alternatives to China, have spoken to us, and I feel their expectations from us are quite realistic and reasonable,\u201d said Sitharaman.\nThe finance minister is scheduled to meet industry bodies and trade leaders, including those from the tourism sector, about the coronavirus threat on Tuesday.\nShe decided on these interactions after a recent meeting in Chennai, where importers flagged their concerns.\nThe government expects to earn Rs 1.25 trillion from Customs duty in 2019-20, according to Revised Estimates, down 19 per cent from last year\u2019s Budget numbers.\nAjay Sahai, director general and chief executive officer, Federation of Indian Export Organisations, said any relaxation in submission of documents for imports purpose would be highly beneficial as statutory agencies have not yet commenced their full operation.\nMeanwhile, officials from finance, commerce and other ministries are also expected to meet stakeholders to find ways on managing the coronavirus fallout.\nFor instance, Principal Economic Advisor Sanjeev Sanyal said he would hold meetings with industry segments over the next week to strategise on overcoming the supply shortage by scaling up domestic production.\n\u201cWe are going to look at ways where we can rework the global supply chain with the help of domestic manufacturers\u2026 We are also talking to other countries.

Concerns about the coronavirus had just subsided on the financial markets - but that is over now. Share prices collapsed at the beginning of the week, oil prices fell. On the other hand, investments such as gold and government bonds, which are considered a \u201csafe haven\u201d in times of crisis, were in demand. The reason for the turbulence: The number of infected people in Italy has risen significantly over the weekend, in China the number of deaths from the virus has skyrocketed and South Korea is also increasingly affected. &quot;It is clear that the economic consequences of the corona epidemic will be considerable,&quot; commented Michael Bissinger, an expert at DZ Bank. Damage from production downtimes, disrupted supply chains, limited consumption options and the loss of travel are already considerable, especially for China and the neighboring countries in Asia. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has already lowered its growth forecast for China and, according to Unicredit chief economist Erik Nielsen, the country&#39;s economy should only grow by 3 percent in the first quarter, after around 6 percent at the end of 2019. In view of the recent sharp increase in importance of China for the According to the expert, this will have a corresponding impact on the global economy. With a view to Germany, economists at leading German financial institutions assume that the epidemic could delay an economic recovery. Because China is an important trading partner for Germany. For the car manufacturers BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen, the Middle Kingdom is the most important single market. In addition, there are temporary production stops, even though BMW and Daimler have now been able to restart their production in China and Volkswagen announced on Monday that it had resumed operations at most of its plants. Industry expert Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer expects global production to decrease by 2.7 million vehicles in 2020 compared to the previous year. The German auto industry is particularly affected because of the high China share of 35 percent of total sales. The Federation of German Industries (BDI) warns of possible effects of the virus on the economy and calls on politicians to act. &quot;In addition to health protection, politicians must now focus on economic crisis management,&quot; said BDI Managing Director Joachim Lang. &quot;The federal government must now quickly provide economic policy impetus to stimulate growth.&quot; The more than 5,000 German companies in China are currently severely restricted in terms of procurement, production and sales. If production in Chinese factories stops longer because they are closed due to the virus, their customers will also be in trouble. Apple, for example, recently received its sales forecast for the current quarter due to the corona virus due to delivery bottlenecks for iPhones. On Monday, the British conglomerate AB Foods also warned of the effects on its textile chain Primark. In Germany, according to BDI, the electrical, automotive, pharmaceutical and paper industries are expecting bottlenecks in deliveries from the Far East. According to expert Nielsen, an additional problem is that central banks cannot react to such supply shocks. When the demand is slow, the money keepers can try to stimulate the buying mood of companies and consumers with cheap money, for example. But if there is simply little or nothing to buy, that is of no use. If less is produced, less has to be transported. Logistics groups and airlines are the first to feel this. Their shares were among the biggest losers next to the papers of German carmakers at the start of the week. For the German leading index Dax it went down by a total of almost four percent by the afternoon. The rest of Europe and Asia also went downhill and the Dow Jones share index lost around three percent on the US stock exchanges at the start of trading. Papers from the luxury industry also came under pressure because a large part of the turnover here is based on purchases from tourists. According to a study by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), the luxury goods industry expects the coronavirus to burden sales and profits in the billions. The economic fears also put pressure on oil prices. Because if economic activity and travel are slowed down, the already existing oversupply on the oil market will be even greater, explains commodities expert Carsten Fritsch from Commerzbank. What was in demand, however, were the facilities that are considered safe havens. Government bonds rose sharply, while their yields fell in return. The gold price rose to a seven-year high, approached the mark of 1700 US dollars per troy ounce (31.1 grams) and even reached a record of 1,561 euros when converted into euros."}, {"content": "Africa-Chinese trade raises spectre of coronavirus outbreak across African continent.

Perhaps it\u2019s cabin fever \u2014 Singaporeans are getting antsy working from home, frustrated with cancelled holiday plans in the face of tightening travel restrictions. Or mayhap, complacency has set in. The world\u2019s medical community has, after all, touted the Singaporean government\u2019s rigorous measures against the spread of Covid-19 as the gold standard for keeping the disease in check. Whatever it is, our island this past weekend was not the ghost town it resembled a month ago after the Dorscon Orange alert was sounded. It was jam-packed everywhere we went: at a kopitiam in Upper Serangoon, a mom-and-pop bakery in Tiong Bahru, a chic new restaurant on Purvis Street, a Chinese fine-diner in Orchard Road, a Yakun outlet in Ion Orchard, and the food basement at Takashimaya. All were thronged with people as if it were 2019 during the Great Singapore Sale, back when we weren\u2019t in the thick of, you know, a pandemic.  \n The government has advised Singaporeans to practise social distancing. What is social distancing, you ask? The idea is to maintain a distance between you and other people \u2014 in this case, at least six feet (about two metres). That also means minimising contact with people, says The New York Times. This is important as there is no vaccine for Covid-19 yet, and social distancing is the only thing that works in lessening the spread of the disease now. China\u2019s drastic drop in new cases within the virus\u2019s epicenter in Wuhan is proof enough that this method has its merits.  \n \u201cI think when you are dealing with an epidemic of a new virus, you are never complacent about it. For both China and Singapore, we may have handled the first phase reasonably well, but we will not be complacent. You should not sound the all-clear,\u201d warns Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan in an interview with CNBC. Sage advice, especially when our neighbour, Malaysia, announced last night that it will enforce a \u201crestricted movement order\u201d, which bans citizens from going overseas and foreigners from entering the country for roughly two weeks starting 18 March.

Meanwhile, the disease has brought Europe to its knees, with Italy having an alarming number of deaths that are already half of China\u2019s total. American cities like New York have shut down schools, theatres, bars and even restaurants. Some speculate that the virus may soon blow up in the rest of South East Asia, where a lot of testing is done haphazardly at best \u2014 our country has seen a few imported cases from Indonesia, and it has since imposed restrictions on medical tourists trying to seek treatment here.  \n Singaporeans know all of this. Yet, this was what we witnessed last weekend.Photo: This is Hunan/Facebook \n This scene greeted us at old-school bakery Tiong Bahru Galicier Pastry: a line of 15 people in its cramped premises, standing mere inches away from each other. Perhaps unwisely, we pressed on as we promised to buy its yummy white coconut kueh dadar, ondeh ondeh and kueh puteri ayu for our parents. With health experts\u2019 advice to maintain a two-metre (some say four) gap between strangers ringing in our head, we pointedly gave a wide berth between ourselves and the lady in front. Our efforts were soon scuppered when an auntie rushed up behind us, invading our personal space like a nosy mother who flings open her teenage son\u2019s bedroom door at midnight without knocking. We stepped away in an attempt to put some distance between us. She inched closer. We strode ahead again and she shadowed us once more like a bad movie sequel. Rinse and miserably repeat. \u201cHey auntie, do you mind not standing so close please?\u201d we finally blurted, not caring if we sounded like a paranoid germophobe (we\u2019d rather be safe than sorry). To her credit, she backtracked quickly, darting her eyes nervously around. We relaxed a little. Soon, it was our turn to order at the cake counter. As we fumbled for cash, we felt someone with clammy skin brushing up against us. Hello again, auntie. In her haste, she probably thought skin-to-skin contact would result in faster service. We damn near sprinted out of the shop. \u201cYou should\u2019ve faked a coughing fit, everyone in the queue would\u2019ve definitely steered clear,\u201d jokes a friend after we related this harrowing tale.  \n   \n  \n The retro bakery is famous for its yummy white coconut kueh dadar. \n 8days.sg reader A.

It was my turn next and so the cashier rung up my order. The lady who coughed wasn\u2019t masked \u2014 I was shocked. Coincidentally, she did not \u2018infect\u2019 her purchases but instead aimed her cough behind her [at me] \u2014 no social responsibility. I later binned the bread for peace of mind. My family and friends told me I shouldn't have paid for it and should have gotten new ones, but everything took place in a short span of time and in hindsight, it might have been for the best so that the possibly germy bread wouldn\u2019t make its way back to the shelf.\u201d How ghastly.

As we swivelled to find its source, a middle-aged guy with his mug several inches from ours bellowed in Mandarin: \u201cI want spicy anchovies!\u201d We recoiled in horror and glared at him. He jerked back almost comically, embarrassed realisation creeping up on his face as he acknowledged he did a totally uncool thing in the time of Covid-19. The irony? He was wearing a surgical mask \u2014 but it was pulled down to reveal his nose and mouth. It stared at us mockingly from the depths of his chin. As if our nerves weren't already frayed enough, the shop assistant then coughed very lightly as she scooped up our anchovies. She may have done this through a mask, but it looked rather flimsy. We get that she couldn't cover her mouth because her hands were busy scooping up our food and that her throat probably tickled so uncontrollably she couldn't help herself \u2014 but perhaps turn the other way? Needless to say, we changed our mind about wanting those little fish after all. On a brighter note, the sour & spicy kimchi that we finally tapowed home was pretty appetising.  \n Even upmarket cafes like Bacha Coffee in Ion Orchard, which is like a glittering java version of TWG\u2019s swish teahouses, didn\u2019t have a single empty seat last Sunday afternoon. There was a mid-length but tightly-packed line of people waiting to enter the busy dining room. \n   \n   \n Why do some restaurants still do this when every single thing you put into your mouth is met with suspicion these days? It\u2019s gross even pre-Covid-19, quite irresponsible now. At the two trendy new restaurants we visited last week, we asked for serving spoons for communal dishes. Both times, the waiters simply left the cutlery resting on our bare table. One of them also used a musty-smelling cloth to wipe said table just minutes earlier. Ideally, eateries should place silverware onto plates, wrap them up in napkins, or only provide them directly to the diner when their food is served.  \n   \n Go out if you must \u2014 small F&B businesses in particular need your love during this difficult period. But do so wisely: avoid overcrowded places, maintain a safe distance from strangers where possible, keep your person to yourself (no brushing up against people, please). And for the love of all things that are good, cover your mouth when you cough and wash your hands immediately after. Do your part to help flatten the curve and protect not just yourself, but loved ones who\u2019re vulnerable to the virus. Can\u2019t or won\u2019t do it?

The Chinese government has practically sealed off the metropolis of Wuhan, which has been particularly hard hit by the new lung disease. As reported by the Chinese state television, flights, trains, ferries and long-distance buses should be stopped from Thursday morning. Residents of Wuhan are therefore only allowed to leave the central Chinese city if they give special reasons. Around eleven million people live in the city where the novel corona virus is believed to have broken out at an animal market. In addition, people were asked to only go public with protective masks. Those who do not wear a mask in hotels, restaurants, shopping centers or parks will be punished, reported the &quot;China Daily&quot; newspaper. Wuhan is particularly hard hit by the disease. However, the virus has now spread to large parts of China and also beyond the country&#39;s borders. The disease had already been detected in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the USA. As more people with flu symptoms get tested for the new virus, the number of confirmed cases continues to rise. As of Thursday, the virus was detected in 571 people, the Chinese health authority reported. These include 95 serious cases, all of which are in Hubei province with the particularly hard-hit metropolis of Wuhan. The World Health Organization (WHO) did not declare a &quot;health emergency of international concern&quot; for the time being, despite the rapid increase in proven infections with the new virus. The emergency committee, which advises the WHO, saw no reason for this on Wednesday, but wanted to meet again on Thursday. The emergency committee recommended that the exchange of information between the states be further improved, as chairman Didier Houssin said. However, the members of the emergency committee did not agree on the assessment of the situation. In the event of an official \u201cemergency\u201d, further concrete recommendations would have been made to states in order to contain the spread across borders as far as possible. Such recommendations may include, for example, that travelers be screened for symptoms of illness and that medical staff be better protected. There was no evidence in Europe until Wednesday. According to the Federal Government, there is a \u201cvery low\u201d health risk for people in Germany. There is no reason to fall into alarmism now, said a spokesman for Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU). The EU prevention authority ECDC spoke of a moderate risk that the pathogen would be introduced into the European Union. It is still unclear how serious and how fatal the disease is, said ECDC Director Andrea Ammon. It is believed that the source of the coronavirus was a wildlife in a fish market in Wuhan. According to experts, it was first transmitted from animals to humans before the virus adapted to its new host and transmissions between humans took place. With the wave of travel to the Chinese New Year on Saturday, the risk of the virus disease spreading is growing. Hundreds of millions of Chinese are on the move in the country&#39;s largest annual wave of travel. The new virus is of the same species as the one that triggered the Sars pandemic in 2002/2003. At that time, around 800 people were killed as a result. As things stand, the new virus is said to be a more harmless variant. Sars viruses are one of the coronaviruses that often cause harmless illnesses such as colds. However, pathogens causing dangerous respiratory diseases such as Mers are also included. A pandemic is the spread of an infectious disease across countries and continents. (dpa)"}, {"content": "Coronavirus: Wuhan companies authorized to \u201cgradually\u201d resume business.

The meeting, however, warned that the risks for sporadic infections and localised outbreaks have not gone away. With the pandemic rampaging across the world, the situation remains complex and challenging. \"Wuhan city and Hubei province should stay focused on medical treatment and community-level containment as the two key priorities.

WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Thursday opened the door to a radical shift in the U.S. government's relationship to private industry as the coronavirus outbreak upends the nation's economy, saying he would back the government taking stakes in certain companies.  \n Asked if he supported the federal government moving to take an equity stake in some companies, Trump said: \"I do. I really do.\"  \n Trump, speaking at a news conference at the White House, added: \"We will be helping the airline industry. We will be helping the cruise ship industry. We probably will be helping the hotel industry.\"  \n The White House did not immediately respond when asked if purchasing shares in battered companies was really under consideration. The U.S. government rarely invests in public companies except in the case of bailouts to save ailing firms and jobs.  \n The COVID-19 disease caused by the novel coronavirus, which originated in China late last year, has sickened more than 11,000 people in the United States and killed more than 180, upending American life as it shutters schools, restaurants and businesses across the country.  \n Bailout requests related to the spread of health crisis, in the form of direct grants, loans, loan guarantees and tax relief, have topped $2 trillion. Companies generally do not welcome government ownership for fear they would lose control of their business, however.  \n  \n PRECEDENT  \n Taking stakes in companies is not without precedent in times of crisis.  \n The Bush and Obama administrations loaned the auto industry, including General Motors and Chrysler, which is now controlled by Italy\u2019s Fiat, $80 billion to avoid the collapse of the industry that they felt would result in the loss of millions of U.S. jobs.  \n The U.S. government spent about $50 billion to bail out GM alone. As a result of the company\u2019s 2009 bankruptcy, the government\u2019s investment was converted to a 61 percent equity stake in the Detroit-based automaker, plus preferred shares and a loan. The government no longer has a stake in the company.  \n Just last month, U.S. Attorney General William Barr said the United States and its allies should consider taking a \"controlling stake\" in Finland\u2019s Nokia and Sweden\u2019s Ericsson to counter China-based Huawei\u2019s dominance in next-generation 5G wireless technology.  \n The Trump administration accuses Huawei of being able to spy on customers and has led a global campaign to convince allies to keep the blacklisted company out of their 5G networks.  \n Even if the idea of ownership stakes is ultimately discarded, sweeping measures to mitigate the economic fallout from coronavirus seem inevitable.  \n Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday urged Congress to pass a $1 trillion economic relief measure by early next week, adding the government was focused on being able to provide liquidity to companies.  \n Asked if a trillion dollar stimulus is enough, Trump said: \"We will know about that later. We'll see what happens. It depends how long, so much depend on what's going on in this room, in terms of the medical. If we can stop it in its track the virus, it's plenty.

It's just that no one can yet say how deep.  \n  \n (GRAPHIC: China's GDP and markets - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/6912/6843/Pasted%20Image.jpg)  \n  \n  \n 2/THE VIRUS AND THE WORLD  \n The coronavirus' repercussions are being felt far and wide, well beyond its starting point in China's Hubei province. Countries reliant on Chinese demand have seen steep drops in their currencies, with the Australian dollar down around 5% in January, its worst month since 2016. The Thai and Korean currencies, exposed to China via tourism and goods exports respectively, are also taking a battering.  \n Growth forecast downgrades for China, the world's No. 2 economy, are coming thick and fast, meaning estimates for other countries are being reworked too. Tellingly, 'Dr' Copper, the best-known gauge of economic health, is down 10% in little more than a week, and oil suffered a fourth week of losses. World stocks have lost $1.2 trillion over the past two weeks and have come under fresh pressure again at the start of the week. Depending on how the virus spreads from now, there could be more pain to come.  \n Selling may focus in particular on travel and leisure, with a European index of these sectors skidding to the lowest since October last week. The beneficiaries? The usual safe-haven plays: gold, for instance, has enjoyed its best month in five.  \n  \n (GRAPHIC: Airline and hotel stocks slide on Coronavirus outbreak - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1644/1619/stocks.png)  \n  \n 3/ARE EURO ZONE BANKS TURNING A CORNER?  \n Blowout performances by Wall Street banks, and bumper Q4 earnings from the Spanish lender Santander, have fed hopes of a strong season for euro zone banks, a raft of which will post results in coming days. How heavyweights such as BNP Paribas, Intesa and ING fared in the last quarter of 2019 will shed more light on how they are riding the wave of negative rates.  \n Troubled Deutsche Bank reported a major loss due to one-offs, but shares rose nonetheless as investors turned their focus on the bank's turnaround potential. With higher interest rates still far off, banks are finding it challenging to grow. But after 20 straight months of downgrades, earnings estimates have started to stabilize.  \n The coronavirus scare, however, threatens to strangle Europe's economic recovery and therefore any banking revival. An index of bank shares has fallen more than 5% so far this year, underperforming the broader euro benchmark.  \n  \n (GRAPHIC: Banks' earnings - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1604/1579/Bank%20earnings%20revisions.png)  \n  \n 4/ WORK AND PAY  \n Friday's non-farm payroll data will show how the U.S. economy fared in the first month of the new decade. The report is expected to show a pickup from December, with a Reuters poll forecasting 156,000 were added, from 145,000 the month before. The previous decade hit a number of milestones. December's report was the 111th monthly scorecard in a row to show employment gains, while the 3.5% unemployment rate matched a low from half a century ago and is roughly a third of the level at the start of the decade. Worries of a trade-war-induced slowdown have faded since the Federal Reserve delivered three rate cuts in 2019. Recent data has largely shown the U.S. economy continuing to expand at a moderate pace, and the Fed has signaled that its monetary policy stance is unlikely to change this year.  \n  \n (GRAPHIC: U.S. Unemployment vs S&P index - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1610/1585/Pasted%20Image.jpg)  \n  \n 5/RETURN OF VOLMAGEDDON  \n When a slight U.S. inflation uptick pushed stock markets lower on Feb. 5 two years ago, few expected it to turn into one of the biggest Wall Street shake-ups in recent years. That episode -- \"Volmageddon\" -- saw the VIX equity volatility gauge triple overnight to 50%, wiping out hordes of small punters who had piled into so-called inverse-vol investments.  \n These strategies, peddled via exchange-traded products and designed to profit from extended spells of market calm, yielded rich pickings as long as volatility stayed low. But as the VIX exploded higher, vehicles such as the ProShares Short VIX ETF tumbled over 80 percent in a day.  \n As we were reminded two years ago, volatility can spike spectacularly in quiet markets. As it happens, the coronavirus has sent the VIX to three-month highs and ProShares ETF, which had climbed back to the highest level reached since Volmageddon, has fallen again. But volatility gauges for bonds and currencies remain well below historic averages. Investors might be wise to brace for reversals.  \n  \n (GRAPHIC: euro-dollar vol - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1650/1625/vol.png) REUTERS"}, {"content": "UPDATE 2-New coronavirus cases in mainland China fall to lowest since January.

China moved to lock down at least three cities with a combined population of more than 18 million in an unprecedented effort to contain the deadly new virus that has sickened hundreds of people and spread to other parts of the world during the busy Lunar New Year holiday.\nThe open-ended lockdowns are unmatched in size, embracing more people than New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago put together.\nThe train station and airport in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, were shut down, and ferry, subway and bus service was halted. Normally bustling streets, shopping malls, restaurants and other public spaces in the city of 11 million were eerily quiet. Police checked all incoming vehicles but did not close off the roads.\nSimilar measures were being imposed on Friday in the nearby cities of Huanggang and Ezhou. In Huanggang, theaters, internet cafes and other entertainment centers were also ordered closed.\nIn the capital, Beijing, major events were canceled indefinitely, including traditional temple fairs that are a staple of holiday celebrations, to stop the spread of the virus.\nThe Forbidden City, the palace complex in Beijing that is now a museum, announced it will close indefinitely on Saturday.\nChina's National Health Commission said on Friday morning the confirmed cases of the new coronavirus had risen to 830 with 25 deaths.\nThe first death was also confirmed outside the central province of Hubei, where the capital, Wuhan, has been the epicenter of the outbreak.\nThe health commission in Hebei, a northern province bordering Beijing, said an 80-year-old man died after returning from a two-month stay in Wuhan to see relatives.\nThe vast majority of cases have been in and around Wuhan or people with connections the city. Other cases have been confirmed in the United States, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and Thailand. Singapore and Vietnam reported their first cases Thursday, and cases have also been confirmed in the Chinese territories of Hong Kong and Macao.\nMany countries are screening travelers from China for symptoms of the virus, which can cause fever, coughing, breathing difficulties and pneumonia.\nThe World Health Organization has decided against declaring the outbreak a global emergency, a step that can bring more money and resources to fight a threat but that can also cause trade and travel restrictions and other economic damage, making the decision a politically fraught one.\nThe decision \"should not be taken as a sign that WHO does not think the situation is serious or that we're not taking it seriously. Nothing could be further from the truth,\" WHO Director General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said. \"WHO is following this outbreak every minute of every day.\"\nChinese officials have not said how long the shutdowns of the cities will last. While sweeping measures are typical of China's Communist Party-led government, large-scale quarantines are rare around the world, even in deadly epidemics, because of concerns about infringing on people's liberties. And the effectiveness of such measures is unclear.\n\"To my knowledge, trying to contain a city of 11 million people is new to science,\" said Gauden Galea, the WHO?s representative in China. \"It has not been tried before as a public health measure. We cannot at this stage say it will or it will not work.\"\nJonathan Ball, a professor of virology at molecular virology at the University of Nottingham in Britain, said the lockdowns appear to be justified scientifically.\n\"Until there's a better understanding of what the situation is, I think it's not an unreasonable thing to do,\" he said. \"Anything that limits people's travels during an outbreak would obviously work.\"\nBut Ball cautioned that any such quarantine should be strictly time-limited. He added: \"You have to make sure you communicate effectively about why this is being done. Otherwise you will lose the goodwill of the people.\"\nDuring the devastating West Africa Ebola outbreak in 2014, Sierra Leone imposed a national three-day quarantine as health workers went door to door, searching for hidden cases. Burial teams collecting corpses and people taking the sick to Ebola centers were the only ones allowed to move freely. Frustrated residents complained of food shortages.\nIn China, the illnesses from the newly identified coronavirus first appeared last month in Wuhan, an industrial and transportation hub. Local authorities demanded all residents wear masks in public places and urged civil servants wear them at work.\nAfter the city was closed off Thursday, images showed long lines and empty shelves at supermarkets, as people stocked up. Trucks carrying supplies into the city are not being restricted, although many Chinese recall shortages in the years before the country's recent economic boom.\nAnalysts predicted cases will continue to multiply, although the jump in numbers is also attributable in part to increased monitoring.\n\"Even if (cases) are in the thousands, this would not surprise us,\" the WHO's Galea said, adding, however, that the number of infected is not an indicator of the outbreak's severity so long as the death rate remains low.\nThe coronavirus family includes the common cold as well as viruses that cause more serious illnesses, such as the SARS outbreak that spread from China to more than a dozen countries in 2002-03 and killed about 800 people, and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, or MERS, which is thought to have originated from camels.\nChina is keen to avoid repeating mistakes with its handling of SARS. For months, even after the illness had spread around the world, China parked patients in hotels and drove them around in ambulances to conceal the true number of cases and avoid WHO experts. This time, China has been credited with sharing information rapidly, and President Xi Jinping has emphasized that as a priority.\nHealth authorities are taking extraordinary measures to prevent the spread of the virus, placing those believed infected in plastic tubes and wheeled boxes, with air passed through filters.\nThe first cases in the Wuhan outbreak were connected to people who worked at or visited a seafood market, now closed for an investigation.

WHO concerned about the arrival in Africa of the outbreak that once again killed doctors in China. A 29-year-old doctor died this Thursday in Wuhan, the city in China&#39;s Hubei province where the coronavirus outbreak was first detected and which remains the most contaminated region. The case is unlike any other because Peng Yinhua, a specialist in respiratory diseases, was infected while working on the frontlines of fighting the coronavirus. It is the second case of its kind: a month ago it was Li Wenliang, another 34-year-old doctor. Li&#39;s case gained international expression when it became known that Chinese authorities had reprimanded him for warning his colleagues at the medical faculty he attended that the coronavirus was an outbreak. Before the government itself did it. Now it&#39;s Peng jumping to the top of the news after it&#39;s been learned that he has postponed his wedding to continue treating infected patients. The news of the death still comes at a delicate moment for the Chinese government, which updated the number of infected: there are another 1109 cases, contributing to a total of over 74,000, in mainland China alone. The deaths to be registered have also increased, to 2236. And the concern arises from where it is not always expected. In prisons, there are already 500 confirmed cases across the country. And here, as with all other statistics, Hubei remains the most critical region, with 271 of those patients. Mostly women. About 1500 kilometers away, in South Korea, the news is no better. In three days, the number of infected tripled, making the country the second most affected by the epidemic, besides China. There are now 156 cases, while in Japan the number remains at 94 if we discount those on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. The Korean situation had its origins in a 61-year-old woman with symptoms of pneumonia, who visited a church in Daegu, a city with more than two million inhabitants and which is just two hours from the capital, Seoul. The woman is now known as &quot;Patient 31&quot; and the country&#39;s authorities have warned that the religious meetings are &quot;overspread events&quot;. They are not prohibited, but not recommended, unlike large gatherings of people, which were even banned. Libraries, schools and kindergartens are closed in Daegu. After a series of positive tests to military personnel, soldiers are also prohibited from leaving the barracks. Korean Prime Minister Chung Se-kyun admits that the country will enter a second phase of the fight against the coronavirus: the \u201cemergency phase\u201d. Cairo&#39;s international airport, capital of Egypt, has increased security, after the detection of a case of coronavirus in the country STR After nearly three months, a new geography must be added to the outbreak. The first infected patient on the African continent is in Egypt, not far from Iran, in Asia, where two people died this week because of Covid-19. For the World Health Organization (WHO) the African case is especially worrying because it is a continent that includes countries with precarious health systems and outdated contingency plans. At a press conference, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the organization is &quot;partnering with the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) in Africa to coordinate efforts and prepare for a possible arrival of the virus&quot; . &quot;We believe that the virus can be a serious danger there, so we are focusing on places where health systems are weakest,&quot; he added. These places are in countries like Nigeria, Ghana, Ethiopia, Sudan, Kenya, Tanzania or Angola, which, however, are not the countries with the highest risk of contamination. Despite the proximity of some to the Asian borders, the risk is considered &quot;moderate&quot; by a study published in the magazine &quot;The Lancet&quot;, which poses the challenge in Egypt, Algeria and South Africa. The paradox is that these are exactly the countries with greater capacity to respond, according to the same source. Vittoria Colizza, researcher at the French University Sorbonne, responsible for the study, says that \u201cAfrican countries have recently strengthened their preparedness to deal with cases imported from Covid-19, including surveillance at airports, temperature control at borders, recommendations to avoid travel to China and the improvement of health information provided to professionals in the sector and the general public\u201d.

For the World Health Organization (WHO), &quot;this is not the time&quot; to consider the situation experienced by the outbreak of the new coronavirus as a global health emergency. The decision was announced this afternoon at a press conference in Geneva, following the second meeting of the WHO Emergency Committee. After the two meetings, the committee formed by medical specialists from several countries and called by the organisation&#39;s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, for the time being dismissed the possible international warning, fearing that &quot;it is too soon&quot;. WHO reserves the possibility of convening the committee in the future to discuss a possible international emergency again, which would imply the implementation of preventive measures at the global level. That international body defines a global emergency as an &quot;extraordinary event&quot; that poses a risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response. Previous global emergencies have been declared for the emergence of the Zika virus in the Americas, the swine flu pandemic and polio. A global emergency declaration usually brings in more money and resources, but it can also prompt foreign governments to rush to restrict travel and trade to affected countries. Responsible, so far, for the death of 18 people, the new virus has spread the warnings, as the number of infected people rises. The outbreak also led to emergency measures, including several closed cities abroad in China, the country of origin of the disease."}, {"content": "Coronavirus scare: 2 Noida schools shut, tourists quarantined, visa suspension extended to 4 countries.

Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can give rise to disease in humans. The deadly virus was identified on January 7, 2020 in China after, on December 31, 2019, several cases of pneumonia of unknown cause were reported to the World Health Organization in workers and people attending the Fish Market, Live Shellfish and Poultry in Wuhan City, Hubei Province. So far 304 people have died, which made the WHO (World Health Organization) declare an International Public Health Emergency. This Friday, more than a thousand new cases were reported and, internationally, more than 14,380 infected have already been confirmed. Symptoms With regard to signs and symptoms, the National Health Service (NHS) advises that patients may have symptoms of acute respiratory infection such as cough, fever and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases &quot;it can lead to severe pneumonia with acute respiratory failure, kidney and other organ failure and eventual death,&quot; the NHS writes on the website. Risk of transmissionAccording to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), there is a moderate probability of importation of cases into European Union countries. ECDC ensured that as long as infection prevention and control practices are adhered to, the probability of secondary transmission is low. Treatment Treatment for people infected with the deadly virus is done taking into account the signs and symptoms that are presented. So far there is no vaccine that cures the virus, but investigations are being carried out in this direction. Protective measures The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended some hygiene measures and food safety practices to reduce the transmission of the disease, such as: Wash your hands frequently, especially after being in direct contact with people who are sick; Avoid unprotected contact with wild or farm animals; Avoid close contact with patients with respiratory infections; Adopt respiratory etiquette measures: cover mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing; Wash your hands whenever you sneeze, cough or blow your nose; What to do if traveling The World Health Organization does not recommend trade with China. If the travel destination is the Chinese country, you should follow the recommendations of the Chinese health authorities and the recommendations outlined above by the WHO. If, on the other hand, you are returning from affected areas that show symptoms of the disease, you should, before going to a hospital, call SNS24 to inform you about your health condition and follow the guidelines that are indicated. Which areas of the world are affected by the deadly virus? So far, cases have been reported in 25 areas of the world. In addition to mainland China (the most affected area), cases of infection have been reported in Sweden, China, Japan, Russia, Taiwan, Cambodia, Italy, Singapore, Nepal, Spain, France, United States of America (USA), Vietnam, India, Finland, Australia, Thailand, Macau, Germany, Hong Kong, Philippines, UK, Malaysia, UAE, South Korea and Canada. The first case in Japan was announced on January 16th. The patient is a 30-year-old Chinese citizen who resides in the Japanese prefecture of Kanagawa, south of Tokyo, but who visited Wuhan earlier this year, the Japanese Ministry of Health said. This Friday the first case of coronavirus in Sweden was confirmed. According to information provided by the newspaper O Globo, the infected person is a woman. Also this Friday, the first two cases of infected people in Russia were confirmed. Both citizens are of Chinese nationality. In Italy, the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, has already announced the first two cases of coronavirus in the country. According to the Italian publication Corriere Della Sera, the patients are two Chinese tourists who were in Rome and who have since been hospitalized and isolated in the Spallanzani hospital, in the Italian capital. France and the United States of America have already confirmed the sixth case of countries. On January 30, the US confirmed the first case of human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus. India&#39;s Ministry of Health also announced the first case of the virus. The student was studying at Wuhan University and is currently isolated and under surveillance in a hospital. Finland confirmed on January 29 the first case of coronavirus. This is a 32-year-old Chinese tourist who has been staying since January 23 in a ski resort in the Saariselk\u00e4 region. In Germany there were four confirmed cases. According to 2DF radio, the three newly infected patients are employees of the company Webasto in the Starnberg district, where the first person affected is employed. In Spain, the first case of coronavirus was confirmed on January 31st. The patient is hospitalized and isolated and will have been infected by another person who already had symptoms. Directorate-General of Health on Coronavirus: &quot;Our alert level has increased&quot;The Directorate-General of Health announced this Friday the increase in the level of alert regarding prevention and containment measures for the new coronavirus, originating in China. At a press conference held this Friday, the Director-General of Health, Gra\u00e7a Freitas, indicated that &quot;the level of alert has increased and the need to strengthen the response capacity with public health measures to detect and isolate cases has also increased&quot;. Seventeen Portuguese rescued from WuhanThe 17 Portuguese held in Wuhan, a Chinese city placed under quarantine, were notified that the flight from which it was planned to be removed this Friday night was postponed to Saturday. This Sunday, February 2nd, the Portuguese arrived in France at 1 pm where they will meet with the Portuguese Air Force team - including doctors - and should return to Portugal today. Transmission Theories Scientists believe that venomous snakes consumed by the Chinese population may be at the origin of the coronavirus that has killed 213 people and has already reached Europe. These animals are sold at the seafood market in Wuhan, the city where the virus has spread. According to The Conversation, numerous scientists have been analyzing the genetic code of the coronavirus and recently discovered that the code present in the samples is identical to that of other viruses present in snakes, bats and birds. On the other hand, a genetic study released on Jan. 29 confirmed that the new coronavirus originating in China had been transmitted to humans through a wild animal, as yet unknown, that was infected by bats. The work, published in the British medical publication The Lancet and which validates in the laboratory a thesis assumed by experts, suggests that the new coronavirus, provisionally designated by the World Health Organization as &quot;2019-nCoV&quot;, had as its initial host a bat and was transmitted to people through an as-yet-unknown wild animal that was sold at the Huanan live animal market in Wuhan, capital of Hubei province in central China. Although cautiously, the study authors admit that the new coronavirus is not the result of a genetic mutation of another coronavirus, but may have entered human cells in the same way as the coronavirus that caused the also identified Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). for the first time in China, in 2002 and 2003. Philippines records death from coronavirus. First deadly victim outside ChinaA Chinese national died in the Philippines from pneumonia caused by the Wuhan coronavirus, the first recorded death outside China, authorities announced this Sunday.

HONG KONG \u2014 A 65-year-old Chinese woman who fell seriously ill after being infected with the coronavirus made a startling recovery after being given stem cell therapy, according to a new study by Chinese scientists. \n The patient had been fighting for her life in the intensive care unit at Baoshan Hospital in Kunming, the capital of southwest China's Yunnan province, for nearly two weeks after contracting Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. \n But according to a paper published by a team of researchers from Kunming University led by Dr Hu Min, just four days after being given her first shot of umbilical cord stem cells, the woman was back on her feet and able to walk. \n \"Although only one case was shown here, it could be very important and inspire similar clinical practices in treating critically ill Covid-19 patients,\" said the study, which was published on Thursday (Feb 27) on Chinaxiv.org, a platform for the release of scientific papers that have yet to be peer-reviewed. \n The treatment \"might be an ideal choice to be used or combined with other immune modulating agents\", it said. \n The Yunnan case is one of 14 trials using stem cells to treat coronavirus patients in China, according to the World Health Organization's (WHO) clinical trial database. While the technology remains controversial, there is hope among health authorities and medical professionals that it could become a lifesaver for critically ill patients. \n The patient in Kunming arrived in the city on Jan 21 on a flight from Wuhan, the capital of central China's Hubei province and the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak. A week later she fell ill with a mild fever, fatigue and coughing, so went to a public hospital where she tested positive for Covid-19. From there she was transferred to Baoshan Hospital. \n Following the strict guidelines laid down by the government for the treatment of coronavirus patients, doctors there first administered antiviral medications and antibiotics, and put the woman\u00a0\u2014 who also suffers from type 2 diabetes\u00a0\u2014 on oxygen to help her breathe. Her condition improved initially but then went rapidly downhill and she was moved to the intensive care unit on Feb 1. \n Things did not improve, and as the woman's health worsened and her organs began to fail, the doctors needed to act fast. So, after consulting the hospital's ethics committee and the patient's family, the stem cell therapy was started on Feb 9. \n Stem cells are highly adaptive early-stage cells that evolve into different types of fully functioning cells to produce tissue, organs or body fluids. The ones used in the Kunming study came from a laboratory culture of umbilical cords from newborn babies. \n The doctors considered using stem cell therapy because Covid-19 has been shown in other studies to cause severe damage to the lungs, liver and other organs. Tests conducted on animals suggested stem cells might be able to repair that damage. \n According to the paper, the Kunming patient was given the first of three shots on Feb 9. After showing no adverse effects to that initial dose she was given a second three days later. On Feb 13, she was able to get out of bed and take a short walk with only limited help. \n She was given her final shot on Feb 15, and two days later was able to leave the intensive care unit and go back to a regular ward. Her vital signs had returned to normal and a throat swab test for Covid-19 came back negative. \n According to Dr Li Honghui, who is involved in similar trials at Loudi Central Hospital in central China's Hunan province, stem cell injections can deliver significant results within three days. \n \"We cannot stick to the rules, we must be bold and innovative,\" he was quoted as saying in a report by Hunan Daily last week. \n Mr Zhang Xinmin, director of biological technology at the Ministry of Science and Technology in Beijing, told a press conference on February 15 that the preliminary results of stem cell experiments conducted across the country suggested the technology was \"safe and effective\". \n Hospitals in Huanggang, one of the worst hit cities in Hubei, received their first shipment of stem cell shots last week and they would be given to three critically ill patients, state media reported. \n Another paper published on Chinaxiv on Friday said that seven coronavirus patients in Beijing had been given stem cell therapy and responded in a similar way to the woman in Kunming. \n Stem cell technology emerged in the 1980s but remains highly controversial. Scientists initially considered using human embryos as the source for the cells, but the idea drew fire on ethical grounds. \n The research community responded by proposing alternative methods for harvesting stem cells, such as turning normal tissue cells into stem cells, but those efforts were tarnished by a series of scandals in the United States, Japan and South Korea involving the fabrication of experimental data. \n In China, scientists are engaged in cutting edge research on stem cells. While the use of cells from healthy embryos is forbidden, scientists are permitted to use fertilised eggs discarded due to illness or defects. \n A doctor treating coronavirus patients in Beijing, who asked not to be named, said there was a growing discussion within the medical community about the potential benefits of stem cell therapy. \n \"The stem cell industry may have some vested interest to promote their technology in this crisis, but if it really works, it should be made available to more patients,\" she said.

This was made possible with the assistance of the Singapore Police Force. \n Four of the locally transmitted confirmed cases (Cases 31, 33, 38 and 83), as well as Cases 8 and 9, are linked to The Life Church and Missions Singapore (146B Paya Lebar Road). \n Nine of the confirmed cases (Cases 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27, 28, 34 and 40) are linked to Yong Thai Hang (24 Cavan Road), a health product shop off Lavender Street. \n Three of the confirmed cases (Cases 30, 36 and 39) are linked to the private business meeting held at the Grand Hyatt Singapore from Jan 20 to 22. \n Five of the confirmed cases (Cases 42, 47, 52, 56 and 69) are linked to the Seletar Aerospace Heights construction site. \n In total, 23\u00a0of the confirmed cases (Cases 48, 49, 51, 53, 54, 57, 58, 60, 61, 62, 63, 66, 67, 68, 70, 71, 73, 74, 78, 80, 81, 84 and 88) are linked to the Grace Assembly of God. \n Investigations on these clusters are ongoing. In addition to the clusters, MOH said that its investigations have identified the following links between cases: \n Case 44, a 37-year-old Singaporean man who works at Certis Cisco Centre and had served Quarantine Orders on two people from Wuhan, was linked to Cases 13 and 26, a mother-and-daughter pair from Wuhan; \n Case 72, a 40-year-old male Chinese national who is a Singapore work pass holder and has no recent travel history to China, is a family member of Case 79, a Malaysian work pass holder, and is also linked to Case 59, a 61-year-old Singaporean man who works at a private hospital here; \n Case 75, a 71-year-old Singaporean woman, is a family member of Case 41, a 71-year-old Singaporean man who visited Paya Lebar Methodist Church and a gathering at Braddell Heights Residents\u2019 Committee; \n Case 77 is linked to Case 50, who in turn is linked to Case 65 and Case 55, a 30-year-old Singaporean man who works at Pulau Bukom and went to the Catholic Church of Christ the King. \n Case 86,\u00a0a 24-year-old Singapore Institute of Technology student,\u00a0is linked to Case 82,\u00a0a 57-year-old Singaporean woman who has both dengue and Covid-19 infections. \n Contact tracing is underway for the other nine locally transmitted cases to establish any links to previous cases or travel history to China. \n Follow TODAY\u2019s coverage of Covid-19 and its latest developments here:\u00a0https://tdy.sg/covid19\u00a0"}, {"content": "Coronavirus impact comes into focus: How it spreads, infects. The medical impact of the new coronavirus is coming into sharper focus as it continues its spread in what is now officially recognized as a pandemic.\nIts true fatality rate isn't yet known, but it seems 10 times higher than the flu, which kills hundreds of thousands around the world each year, the United States' top infectious disease expert told lawmakers last week.\nMost people have had mild to moderate illness and recovered, but the virus is more serious for those who are older or have other health problems.\nThat's a huge number, said Dr. Tom Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who now heads a global health organization. In the U.S., 60% of adults have at least one underlying health condition and 42% have two or more.\n\"There's still a lot that we don't know\" about the virus and disease it causes, COVID-19, he said.\nHOW IT SPREADS\nMost spread is from droplets produced when an infected person coughs, which are inhaled by people nearby. Transmission from touching contaminated surfaces hasn't been shown yet, though recent tests by U.S. scientists suggest it's possible -- one reason they recommend washing your hands and not touching your face.\nThe virus can live in the air for several hours, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. Cleaning surfaces with solutions containing diluted bleach should kill it.\n\"While we are still learning about the biology of this virus, it does not appear that there is a major risk of spread through sweat,\" said Julie Fischer, a Georgetown University microbiologist. The biggest concern about going to the gym is infected people coughing on others, or contaminating shared surfaces or equipment, she said. Consider avoiding large classes and peak hours and don't go if you're coughing or feverish, she suggests.\nThe risk of virus transmission from food servers is the same risk as transmission from other infected people, but \"one of the concerns in that food servers, like others facing stark choices about insurance and paychecks, may be pressured to work even if they are sick,\" she said.\nHOW FAST DOES IT SPREAD?\nEach infected person spreads to two or three others on average, researchers estimate. It spreads more easily than flu but less than measles, tuberculosis or some other respiratory diseases. It is not known if it spreads less easily among children, but fewer of them have been diagnosed with the disease. A study of 1,099 patients in China found that 0.9% of the cases were younger than 15.\nWHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?\nMost people get fever and cough, sometimes fatigue or shortness of breath, and recover after about two weeks. About 15% develop severe disease, including pneumonia, Chinese scientists reported from 45,000 cases there. Symptoms usually start slowly and often worsen as the illness goes on.\nIn a report last week on the first 12 patients in the U.S., seven were hospitalized; most had underlying health problems and got worse during the second week of illness.\nIn China, slightly more males have been diagnosed with COVID-19 than females, which might be because roughly half of Chinese men smoke but only 5% of females do, Frieden said.\nChildren seem to get less sick -- a report on 10 in China found that fevers tended to be milder and they lacked clear signs of pneumonia.\nWHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE?\nSome cruise ship passengers described symptoms similar to the common cold or flu.\n\"It's been a 2 on a scale of 10,\" said Carl Goldman, who was hospitalized in Omaha, Nebraska, after flying home.\nHowever, a Chinese postgraduate student described going to the hospital twice after her symptoms worsened, and feeling \"a heavy head while walking, unable to breathe, and nauseous.\"\nWHAT'S THE TEST LIKE?\nThe CDC recommends at least two swabs -- nose and throat. Samples are sent to labs that look for bits of viral genetic material, which takes roughly 4 to 6 hours. Altogether, it can take several days to ship a sample and get results back.\nIt's been taking two to three days, and \"we are working really hard to see if we can shorten that time\" by developing an in-house test, Dr. Aimee Moulin of the University of California, Davis said Thursday in a conference call held by the American College of Emergency Physicians.\nSome areas have opened drive-thru sites for testing, which could reduce exposure to health workers and other patients or the public.\nWHEN IS THE VIRUS MOST CONTAGIOUS?\nThe average time from exposure to developing symptoms is five to six days, but can be up to two weeks. Tests have found high amounts of virus in the throats and noses of people a couple days before they show symptoms.\nSigns of virus also have been found in stool weeks after patients recover, but that doesn't mean it's capable of causing illness, scientists warn.\n\"The virus can be degraded,\" said Robert Webster, a St. Jude Children's Research Center virus expert. \"It's not necessarily infectious virus at all.\"\nHOW DEADLY IS IT?\nThat won't be known until large studies are done to test big groups of people to see how many have been infected and with or without symptoms.\nScientists have estimated the fatality rate from less than 1% to as high as 4% among cases diagnosed so far, depending on location.\nFlu kills about 0.1% of those it infects, so the new virus seems about 10 times more lethal, the National Institutes of Health's Dr. Anthony Fauci told Congress last week.\nThe death rate has been higher among people with other health problems -- more than 10% for those with heart disease, for example. In the U.S., 30 million have diabetes, more than 70 million are obese and nearly 80 million have high blood pressure.\nCAN INFECTED PEOPLE WHO RECOVER GET IT AGAIN?\nIt's not known. A few reports from China say some people had COVID-19, recovered and then fell ill again. It's unclear if that's a relapse, a new infection, or a case where the person never fully recovered in the first place.\nScientists at the at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle say the 30,000-letter genetic code of the virus changes by one letter every 15 days. It's not known how many of these changes would be needed for the virus to seem different enough to the immune system of someone who had a previous version of it for it to cause a fresh infection.\nFauci told Congress on Thursday that it was unlikely that someone could get reinfected.\n\"We haven't formally proved it, but it is strongly likely that that's the case,\" he said. \"Because if this acts like any other virus, once you recover, you won't get reinfected.\"\nWILL IT GO AWAY IN THE SUMMER?\nFlu fades each spring and the new virus may do the same, Fauci said last week in a podcast with a journal editor.\n\"I am hoping that as we get into the warmer weather we will see a decline that will give us a chance to get our preparedness up to speed,\" Fauci said.\nBut that, too, is far from certain. \"We have to assume that the virus will continue to have the capacity to spread, and it's a false hope to say yes, it will just disappear in the summertime like influenza,\" said Dr. Michael Ryan, the World Health Organization's emergencies chief.\nFlu viruses also mutate quickly, requiring new vaccines to be made each year. If the coronavirus follows suit, Frieden said, \"It could become a virus that circulates around the world for many years to come.\""}, {"content": "Coronavirus: Athletes advised to avoid China if possible.

TOKYO - Two Japanese citizens evacuated from Wuhan who refused to undergo tests for the new coronavirus have set off a political quandary in Japan over the evacuation mission, with debate centred on how the human rights of a minority should not supersede a potential health menace to society. \n The two, who were among 206 nationals on Japan's first chartered flight out of the epicentre of the 2019-nCOV outbreak which landed at Tokyo's Haneda Airport on Wednesday, had displayed no symptoms at the airport and were \"escorted home\" after refusing to undergo further tests. Their actions came as three new cases of the virus were identified from the evacuees. \n Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had to step in to calm nerves on Thursday (Jan 30). \n \"While quarantine officers did their best to persuade them to go for further tests, they refused, and unfortunately there is no legal basis to force them to do so,\" Mr Abe told the Diet, as Japan's Parliament is known. \"There are some areas that the government is reluctant to forcefully step in because it encroaches on human rights. But from the second flight we should see how we can properly confirm the health status of all evacuees.\" \n He stressed: \"We will do our utmost to protect the lives and health of the people, and we will make decisions without hesitation.\" \n While the new Wuhan virus has been named a \"designated infectious disease\" in Japan under a special law, it only allows the authorities to make compulsory the hospitalisation of confirmed patients. \n This issue has flared up in Japan, stirring debate among Twitter users, who argue that upholding the human rights of two people should not be more important than averting a potential health menace to society. \n The term \"kensa kyohi\" (rejection of inspection) is trending on the social media platform, with many calling the duo irresponsible and asking for details like where they live so that they can avoid the neighbourhood. Some have gone as far as to say that they should not have been allowed on the chartered flight in the first place. \n Emotions are running high as Japan diagnosed its first cases with no visible flu symptoms on Thursday. These were among the 206 people who returned a day earlier. \n The question, of whether people who have been infected but show no symptoms can still spread the virus, remains unresolved. \n Among the 206, five had been immediately warded upon landing after they reported having a fever and cough. None subsequently tested positive for the Wuhan bug. \n Of the other 199 who had agreed to further tests at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID), seven were hospitalised after flu symptoms were confirmed. \n Among these seven, one 2019-nCOV case was found: a man in his 50s who had a runny nose and a sore throat. He subsequently developed a 38.7 deg C fever. \n And among the remaining 191, two cases, a man and a woman in their 40s, had displayed no visible symptoms and were identified only through NIID tests. They have been quarantined. \n Meanwhile, a second chartered flight, carrying 210 Japanese citizens, landed at Tokyo's Haneda Airport on Thursday. Of these, 13\u00a0people who had fever or cough have been hospitalised, public broadcaster NHK reported. Another 300 people who are still stranded in Wuhan want to return to Japan, the Foreign Ministry said. At least one more chartered flight is being planned. \n Further, an Osaka tour guide in her 40s has also tested positive for the 2019-nCOV virus. The tour guide had worked with a previously-identified case - a Japanese bus driver in his 50s who lives in Nara prefecture - in leading a group of tourists from Wuhan from Jan 12 to 17. The group travelled from Narita Airport, to the east of Tokyo, to Kansai International Airport in Osaka. Both cases have no recent travel history to the virus-hit central Chinese city, and the Health Ministry said they were likely infected when travelling with the group of tourists. \n The government is doing urgent contact tracing to identify any people who have come in close contact with the tour group, including in Yamanashi prefecture near Mount Fuji and in Osaka. \n Japan now has a total of 11 confirmed cases of the virus."}, {"content": "New virus in China: cases in Europe are becoming more likely. After the rise in the number of patients in China, experts believe that isolated introductions of the new lung disease to Europe are more and more likely. It cannot be ruled out that a sick person may travel to Germany, said Lars Schaade, Vice President of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) in Berlin. But you don&#39;t have to worry in Germany. &quot;We have to expect more cases in other parts of China and possibly in other countries in the coming days,&quot; said World Health Organization (WHO) spokesman Tarik Ja\u0161arevi\u0107 in Geneva on Tuesday. That is not unusual: &quot;If you expand surveillance, it is also likely that you will discover more cases.&quot; The health authority of the central Chinese metropolis of Wuhan reported further deaths from the novel corona virus. A total of six deaths have now been confirmed, most of them affecting older people with serious previous illnesses. Dozens of other infections were also reported on Tuesday. With that, there are now more than 300 confirmed cases in China since the outbreak began in December. There is also evidence in Taiwan, Thailand, Japan and South Korea - in all cases sick people who were previously in Wuhan. &quot;We have to prepare ourselves in Germany for the fact that the disease will be introduced, at least in individual cases,&quot; said the Berlin virus researcher Christian Drosten. &quot;Clinics must then be prepared to isolate the patients.&quot; The health risk for the population in Germany is currently classified by the responsible RKI as &quot;very low&quot;. Although there could be individual cases of imports, continued chains of infection - i.e. subsequent transmissions from person to person - are unlikely according to the current status, according to RKI Vice President Schaade. A few infected people also came to Germany with the Mers coronavirus without further transmissions in Germany. The Federal Ministry of Health also rates the risk for Germany as low. &quot;Nevertheless, we are of course closely monitoring the situation in China and are in constant contact with our international partners,&quot; said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of Health. With the current wave of travel for Chinese New Year on Saturday, the risk of the virus spreading is growing. Hundreds of millions of Chinese people are out and about during the two-week holiday period around the festival, and many families also travel abroad together. In addition to destinations in Southeast Asia, trips to Europe or the USA are also popular. Asian neighbors and airports in other countries such as the US and Australia have now introduced fever controls when entering from Wuhan. The Italian Ministry of Health announced that it will investigate suspected cases on board planes from Wuhan landing in Rome. Pilots should therefore report passengers with corresponding symptoms. These would then be immediately taken to the national institute for infectious diseases in Rome, it said. For the time being, there are no special measures at German airports. However, Frankfurt Airport has made preparations. &quot;The plan is in the drawer,&quot; said a spokeswoman for the operating company Fraport on Tuesday. If the health department in Frankfurt made recommendations, these would be implemented. There are no direct flights from Wuhan to Frankfurt. Also from D\u00fcsseldorf Airport it was said that the responsible health department has not yet considered any measures necessary. If there is a suspected case on board a plane heading for D\u00fcsseldorf, the pilot would give a message to air traffic control or the airport, a spokesman said. \u201cThe airport would immediately inform the health department and later place the relevant machine in a separate area.\u201d The Robert Koch Institute said that there was no scientific evidence for the effectiveness of so-called entry screenings at airports, i.e. controls upon entry. However, exit screenings are useful in areas particularly affected by a wave of diseases. The 11 million metropolis of Wuhan has already introduced appropriate controls upon departure. The World Health Organization (WHO) has convened its emergency committee because of the lung disease. The experts should consult on Wednesday. Should the WHO declare an international health emergency, it recommends stricter measures to combat the disease. This may include border controls and the setting up of specialized treatment centers. The WHO does not currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. &quot;Based on the information available, there is no justification for restrictions on travel or trade,&quot; said the spokesman. &quot;Should the situation escalate, the WHO could comment on the risks of traveling to affected areas.&quot; The EU Commission is also planning a meeting to assess the risks posed by the new lung disease. According to a spokesman, the health security committee is due to meet on Thursday. There was already an exchange between the EU states last Friday, during which possible reactions to the corona virus were discussed.

The health department is currently preparing a crisis team to be prepared for a coronavirus emergency. According to Martin G\u00f6tz, Head of Division for Infection Protection at the Senator of Health, the seven deaths and 220 confirmed patients in Italy \u201cbrought new dynamism to development\u201d. With the crisis team, the authority wants to prepare for the event that the virus known as Covid-19 also occurs in the Hanseatic city. There is no longer the calm atmosphere that prevailed three weeks ago, G\u00f6tz reported from an expert conference on Monday. Representatives from all federal states, the federal government and the Berlin Robert Koch Institute took part. There was also the question of whether the affected Italian regions Lombardy and Veneto will be listed as risk areas in the future. A corresponding decision was not made by evening, but G\u00f6tz assessed it as &quot;very likely&quot; for the coming days. That depends on the further development in Italy. The Robert Koch Institute already expanded its recommendations on risk areas on Monday without naming Italy directly. There are countries and regions in which individual cases of infection with and without traceability of the infection chains or infection clusters have occurred, it says. With corresponding symptoms and stays in such countries, Covid-19 should therefore be considered as a possible diagnosis. The institute has also adjusted its overall risk assessment. An import of further cases to Germany must be expected. Further transmissions, chains of infection and local infection events in Germany are possible. It can be assumed that it will no longer be possible to stop the global spread of the pathogen, even if the health risks in Germany are currently assessed to be low. Against this background, G\u00f6tz considers it sensible to at least prepare a Bremen crisis team. This means that the Senate departments, as well as the fire brigade and police, designate their respective responsible persons &quot;in order to be able to flip the switch immediately in an emergency&quot;. The task of a crisis team is to use the options provided for in the Infection Protection Act to prevent further diseases. It is conceivable to close facilities such as schools or daycare centers or to cordon off entire cities, as in Italy. You have to see what is \u201cappropriate and proportionate\u201d in each case, says G\u00f6tz. He reports that the majority of German experts consider the measures in Italy to be &quot;exaggerated&quot;. &quot;The admission of 20 patients to intensive care units also makes us a little puzzled.&quot; If Italian regions are classified as risk areas, the number of suspected Covid 19 cases requiring clarification should also increase significantly in Bremen. In contrast to China, for example, there are direct flight connections to Italy. Overall, travel between Italy and Germany is eight times higher than between Germany and China. A specific suspicion of an illness with the new virus exists if two circumstances come together: on the one hand, the clinical symptoms of the illness such as cough, fever and shortness of breath, on the other hand, the person concerned must either contact a confirmed Covid-19 in the 14 days before 19 patients or have been in a risk area. According to the recommendations of the Robert Koch Institute, these have so far been regions in China, Korea and Iran. According to Holger Schelb, general practitioners from the Bremen General Practitioner Association are asked to clarify only clinical symptoms and the history, but then not to make any further diagnostics. &quot;If a case that requires clarification should arise, we would either refer the patient to a hospital or send them home, depending on the severity of the symptoms, with the request to remain there,&quot; says Schelb. The health department will carry out the further examinations in order to receive all information immediately.

In five days since Saturday, the number of people infected with the new coronavirus in Europe has soared from five dozen to more than 450; the death toll from one to 14. And with the arrival of the coronavirus in Brazil, with a confirmation this Wednesday in S\u00e3o Paulo, Antarctica becomes the only continent without cases. Thus entered a new phase in which Covid-19 is already spreading faster throughout the rest of the world than in China. Although the acceleration of the outbreak is generating a serious concern within the European Union (EU), the situation is not, for now, a reason for panic: the EU again guaranteed on Tuesday that it was working &quot;on all fronts \u201d to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus in Europe, insisting on the need for coordination of Member States \u201cin real time\u201d to tackle a phenomenon that is \u201cdynamic\u201d. The European Commission stressed that the fundamental thing is for the EU, as a whole, to be \u201cprepared\u201d for an eventual increase in the epidemic, both in terms of treatment and containment of the outbreak. One of the most sensitive issues associated with the increase in cases, and particularly with the situation in Italy, is border control, which the Commission has stressed is not within its competence, but rather within each Member State. However, such a scenario is not ruled out either. The country that is most worrying European health authorities is Italy. This is because since Friday there has been a sudden increase in positive cases: on that day there were only three people infected with the virus, but in the meantime that number rose to 400 infected. This Wednesday, the twelfth victim in the country was also confirmed. Italian authorities are trying to tighten the grip on Covid-19 even more: the containment measures announced this weekend for ten locations where around 50,000 people live in all are still in place. Veneto, Piedmont and Lombardy, in Northern Italy, are the critical regions that are located in the \u201cred zone\u201d. For now, the pattern of deaths recorded in Italy is similar to that seen in China. It is the elderly and those with associated diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, respiratory diseases and others that depress the immune system, that are being most affected. After Italy, Germany remains the European country with the most cases, but no new infections. France has already confirmed a total of 17 infected in the country and a second fatality: a 60-year-old French man died in Paris at dawn after being diagnosed. Norway, Austria, Croatia, Switzerland, Spain, Northern Macedonia and Greece also confirmed new cases of infection. So far, the only known case of a Portuguese infected by the new virus is that of Adriano Maranh\u00e3o, the crew of a cruise ship who was admitted to a hospital in the Japanese city of Okazaki, located about 300 kilometers from Tokyo. All suspected cases detected in Portugal (until this Wednesday there were 18) were negative. The virus that has killed more than 2,760 people (mostly in China) is now spreading throughout the rest of the world at greater speed and people are already infected in more than 40 countries. In addition to deaths in mainland China, victims are reported in Iran, South Korea, Italy, Japan, Hong Kong, Philippines, France and Taiwan. China on Wednesday reported 52 deaths, the smallest daily increase in three weeks, while it reported 406 new cases, the majority in Hubei province. The number of new patients thus registered a drop of 20% compared to Monday, for example. According to data updated by the National Health Commission of China, the country has more than 2700 deaths and 78 thousand confirmed cases. Among those infected, more than 45,000 were still active and more than 8,500 patients were in serious condition. On the other hand, almost 30,000 people have already been discharged. Although Iran is the country with the most deaths from the new coronavirus after China \u2013 in the last week alone there were 139 cases of infection and 19 people died \u2013 President Hassan Rouhani said his government is not planning to put cities and quarantined districts of the country. However, authorities have already closed schools and some universities and admit to prolonging this decision for a few more days. There are also plans to restrict access to Shiite holy sites this Friday. On the other hand, 11 countries have &quot;closed&quot; their land and air borders with Iran (neighbors Iraq, Turkey, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Armenia, and other countries in the region such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Jordan, United Arab Emirates, Oman and Georgia). Avoiding panic is one of the key messages of the World Health Organization (WHO): the organization&#39;s director of public health, Maria Neira, assured this Wednesday that it is &quot;irrational and disproportionate&quot; to run out of masks and disinfectants in pharmacies for fear of the coronavirus. Speaking to Spanish broadcaster RAC-1, Neira recalled that the masks are for the use of health workers and stressed that the decrease in victims and infected people that is being registered in China \u201ccould mean that the epidemic has reached its peak and reached the epidemic peak\u201d. But, on the other hand, Bruce Aylward, the specialist who led the WHO team sent to China warned that the planet \u201cis not ready\u201d to face a pandemic of this new coronavirus. As for the preparation of our country, the Minister of Foreign Affairs guaranteed that we are prepared for an eventual \u201centry\u201d of the Covid-19 coronavirus. Augusto Santos Silva referred this Wednesday that there is a contingency plan ready to be activated in Portugal. However, he stressed that this is a global problem that requires concerted action, particularly at European level.

As had already been announced, Portugal is strengthening prevention measures and the network of laboratories and hospitals available to receive suspected cases of infection by the new coronavirus. In terms of future measures, the Portuguese government does not rule out the closure of borders, but reinforced that it will only do so in conjunction with the European Union, in line with the intentions of the European Commission. The pulmonologist and coordinator of the Medical Association&#39;s crisis office, Filipe Froes, told Lusa this Wednesday that, compared to the response capacity for influenza A ten years ago, now there is &quot;less hospital response capacity, less human resources and less differentiation\u201d. &quot;The challenge will be much greater, but it also has to be adjusted to the transmission of the disease, the number of Portuguese people affected and the severity&quot;, he said, stressing that &quot;the challenge at this moment is still unknown&quot;."}, {"content": "US warned to prepare for coronavirus pandemic as Europe lockdowns spread.

Franka Lu is a Chinese journalist and entrepreneur. She works in China and Germany. In this ZEIT-ONLINE series, she reports critically about life, culture and everyday life in China. In order to protect her professional and private environment, she writes under a pseudonym. The coronavirus in China made for the most unusual Spring Festival I&#39;ve ever experienced. I read and hear from a distance on empty streets in the cities, little fireworks, but a lot of fear everywhere, even anger. Travel restrictions make it almost impossible for people to travel home to their families. The spring festivals I remember now seem like a dream from a hundred years ago. That fills me with almost nostalgic feelings. As a Chinese immigrant in Germany, I usually have many more opportunities to celebrate in winter than the Germans themselves: At Christmas and New Year, I also have the Chinese Spring Festival and the Chinese New Year Festival, which begins between the end of January and mid-February with the New Year (this time this fell on January 25th), lasts 15 days and ends with sweet rice balls and the lantern festival. The Germans, on the other hand, have to deal with their post-holiday depression from January 2nd, Easter is barely visible as a light at the end of a very long and cold tunnel. My holiday mood, on the other hand, lasts a month or two longer, because the Lantern Festival takes place in mid to late February. For a Chinese like me living abroad, the Chinese New Year festivities have become more of a virtual thing anyway. Over the past few years, I&#39;ve used social media to watch from afar how China comes to a standstill almost completely in the two weeks of the Spring Festival or is transformed into a huge, ever faster carousel: People travel home to where their families are Life. The eleven months of the year, filled to the limit with work and competition, merge into a month filled with alcohol and just as fierce family competition. The flood of travelers then usually pours in all directions over the whole country, it is briefly the largest human migration worldwide: Three billion trips to family reunions were counted during the Spring Festival 2019, on land, on water or in the air they were scarce 1.4 billion Chinese on the go. To Europeans, the idea of \u200b\u200bsuch a huge number of travelers may sound abstract, for me it is linked to the memory of an intense physical experience when I was still living in China. It always started at least a month earlier when I was fighting for tickets for the plane, train and bus to get home on time - in competition with millions of Chinese people who were by no means less eager to travel. Then the same competition, the fight for a taxi to get to the airport or train station on time; Queuing for at least two to three security checks, with subtle or not-so-subtle elbow use or strategic positioning to keep others from jostling; Knuff and shout for not moving forward fast enough; Occasional quarrels and struggles for the seat on the train, although I had the ticket with the reservation and the person who was sitting there didn&#39;t ... I can still smell the smell of all the transit locations: the mixture of strong body exhalations, cheap plastic bags and crumbly Suitcase leather, cleaning products on marble or concrete floors, the tension of people like the smell of charcoal in the air. The spring festivities only really began when, for example, the train started to move slowly. Relief and happiness. The passengers on the train immediately opened their bags, and the smell of all kinds of food soon wafted through the wagons. The less luxurious the trip, the more food and drinks were shared between passengers. People asked each other about their jobs, families, family status, and income, made appropriate compassionate noises, or gave unsolicited tips on how to deal with personal problems. As a young woman, it was all moving and unsettling for me at the same time. Over the years I have not only been offered delicious food on the Spring Festival trips, but also visits to complete strangers and even a few potential husbands. The encounter that impressed me the most, however, took place in a long-distance coach. As soon as she woke up from a long sleep, a young woman put her elbow on my shoulder and began to brush her hair. I kept quiet and allowed myself to be used as her dressing table without resistance during the whole process. She seemed to me to be a migrant worker. Maybe she was lonely and I was just shy. We didn&#39;t exchange a single word. Since I was able to afford plane and express train tickets, there have been no more intimate encounters of this kind. The trips to the Spring Festival have become less challenging and much neater in general. In recent years, the good cellular connections along the route have ensured that instead of conversations with fellow passengers, you could increasingly hear video and game noises, phone calls and chats via social media. What hasn&#39;t changed until the end is the ubiquitous smell of food. I really horrified a German friend on one of my last Spring Festival trips to date when I unpacked my package with spiced duck feet that I bought at the Shanghai express train station. This is the last remnant of national pride that I haven&#39;t gotten rid of yet. It used to take some courage to return to their hometown as young people - who had moved away but had not yet definitely arrived elsewhere. In ancient China they said \u8fd1 \u4e61\u60c5 \u602f: The closer you get to your hometown, the more nervous you get. In the West, people have been familiar with these mixed feelings since Christmas. &quot;You never know which tests you will be subjected to by your parents or various relatives. We call this mixture of longing to return home and fear of such attacks ... Schr\u00f6dinger&#39;s Spring Festival.&quot; In the prelude to a song that is very popular among young city dwellers in China, it says tips for self-help at the Spring Festival, sung by the Rainbow Choir from Shanghai. The hashtag named after the song title on Douban, one of the largest social media platforms, is now also very popular, with 2.5 million hits and more than a thousand tips. Families who show off their children&#39;s achievements are of course not only found in China, but the competitive thinking and the shameless crossing of borders can be more overwhelming than in Europe: like the strangers on the train, older relatives like to ask about the income of the children during the Spring Festival Younger people, according to dates and marriage intentions, according to the details of birth plans, parenting plans for the babies - again there is advice free of charge without being asked. It is also by no means unusual for comments on your weight, the length of your legs and neck, your diet, your skin. Everything out of sheer care, of course. Once the bragging (if only on the outside) of proud parents starts, the stakes at the game swirl on the table. The son has been promoted, the other has a fat baby; one daughter gave her parents a luxurious apartment, the other took her parents on a trip to Europe ... Then the time has come to hand over the blessings in the form of money in red envelopes (\u7ea2\u5305 or Hongbao) to the children and the elderly. That is the final, brutal mission: prosperity. The Hongbao competition has changed a lot in the past few years thanks to the Internet empire Tencent. For Spring Festival 2014, Tencent launched a new in-app service called WeChat Hongbao in its social media app WeChat. Since digital payments are made everywhere anyway, it was an immediate success: 823 million participants used the service at the 2019 Spring Festival. For members of a group chat, WeChat Hongbao even offers the possibility to compete for the same Hongbao. As a result, WeChat has changed an old Chinese custom in three respects. For one thing, the old custom only dictated that money be distributed to family members; but now one is somehow obliged to consider friends and colleagues as well. Secondly, many Internet companies today also give digital Hongbao to their users for the purpose of customer loyalty. The short video platform Kuaishou will transfer Hongbaos in the amount of one billion yuan (almost 130 million euros) this year. And thirdly, the geographical distance is no longer a reason to forego handing over the red envelopes, this can now be done from anywhere in the world, no matter where you live, even on the island of Palau. Since then, during the holiday weeks, many Chinese have been staring at their cell phones to catch a glimpse of happiness. Soon, new apps emerged that were supposed to help the greedy to automatically get to the digital envelopes of companies. So far I haven&#39;t won a competition because I&#39;ve been too far away in recent years: Whenever I saw the envelopes on the screen, someone in China had already emptied them. With these false promises it is like with distant stars in the sky: What I see is only the memory of something long past. And yet I also have to distribute my Hongbaos online. Fortunately, WeChat has set an upper limit for the sum of each red envelope in a chat group: 200 yuan, about 26 euros. But it&#39;s not just emigrants who watch the goings-on during the Spring Festival from afar.\u70ed\u95f9, the gathering of a large, boisterous crowd, may be the core of worldly happiness in Chinese society, but more and more people are getting fed up with it. Some rich, but also some middle-class families are now taking overseas vacations to escape the noise, traffic and air pollution in China, which, for example, bring with them the many fireworks during the Spring Festival. The countries of Southeast Asia and Japan are the favorite destinations, the really rich and worldly prefer even more distant corners of the planet. But wherever they go, most of them stay connected on WeChat to post photos and videos and chat with friends and relatives. This is a slightly different Spring Festival competition. The further from home you are, the better. On the other hand, I stay exactly where I am, and that too is quite an achievement. At some point I started boycotting a traditional Spring Festival activity, namely the China Central TV New Year&#39;s Gala. This television show was launched by the government broadcaster in 1983, and the mutual viewing after the opulent time has long since become an indispensable element of the family celebration. I grew up with it and gradually lost my taste for it as my political thinking and ethical standards changed. I heard about the backstage stories: the famous director who was jailed for taking bribes; one by one the beautiful singers became lovers of political leaders; popular comedians were kicked out of the show and weren&#39;t allowed to appear on any other show because they insisted on protecting their copyrights ... Ugly power games are inevitable on a show that aims to seduce the souls of 1.4 billion people on New Year&#39;s Day and to shape. There have been isolated calls this year to cancel the show due to the outbreak of the new coronavirus. But then it went on without much mentioning of the sick and dying. This was sharply commented on on the Internet as &quot;disco dance on the graves&quot;. Many younger people shared their disgust for the Ideal World Show on social media. A generally still small, but growing number of young people, especially in the big cities, has not endured the gala for a long time, its embarrassing aesthetics, the forced cheerfulness, the demonstrative display of love for the army and the party, the gender stereotypes, the celebrations of the traditional family . Not the slightest bit of negativity or criticism is allowed, love and happiness are mandatory: look at the grandiose overall picture of the nation and forget about any pain. And the parents are always right and caring, as is the party and its army. In villages and small towns everything looks a little different. The younger homecoming migrant workers have an additional obligation during the Spring Festival: they are sent on blind dates prepared for them by families and professional matchmakers. They have to find a husband or wife during these ten days because they usually have no vacation for the rest of the year. Family-arranged blind dates have been the norm in China for centuries. Only with the founding of the People&#39;s Republic did this tradition slowly die out. In the countryside, however, marriage has resurrected as a thriving industry over the past decade in response to the bitter reality of migrant workers&#39; lives. In this regard, too, 2020 is an exceptional year: the access roads to many small towns and villages are blocked to prevent infection with the corona virus. So the marriage brokerage is also this year. The blind date industry is also flourishing in the country because the ratio of female births to male births in China is clearly imbalanced in favor of boys. China ranks 106th out of 153 countries in the current Global Gender Gap Index: the abortion of female fetuses or even the killing of newborn babies is so widespread in some areas that young men can hardly find a partner. Professional marriage initiation has become such a necessity; only the commercial institutes have the time to look for the few girls. Many reports describe the very direct selection processes used to arrange these dates. On a hectic day, a young woman can get together with more than a dozen men. Then it is important to obtain information from the applicants about cars, houses, income, height, appearance, character, under the strict scrutiny of parents and other relatives. It sounds like a ridiculous shopping experience: match shopping. However, given the low status of a wife in the village and the lack of institutional protection against domestic violence, marriage for women is a risky and burdened with many duties. The smarter girls take a man with older sisters because in the country they are usually obliged to support the younger brother financially. Very brave young women refuse to marry, others go to town and work hard for their financial independence. But during the Spring Festival, even these rebellious women travel back to their parents and bring them money and gifts. From the third day of the Lunar New Year, people gradually return to their jobs. Once again the hectic efforts to get the bus, train or flight, but now in a state of food coma. Some are sad, most are relieved. I have always belonged to this latter majority. After all, most of us moved to the bigger cities with good reason to study and work. Freedom and independence are seductive. I read many old poems about the Spring Festival by poets who had left their hometowns. Most describe sadness and homesickness. Traditional Chinese have always seen leaving home as the greatest tragedy in life. Obviously, China has changed after all, despite all seeming nostalgia for a glorious but petrified past. There are more and more people who identify with the modern spirit of the Tang Dynasty poet Meng Haoran: &quot;I drift through the world and have my pleasure wherever I am, do not care about the old years that have passed by&quot; (\u5ba2 \u884c \u968f\u5904 \u4e50 \uff0c \u4e0d\u89c1 \u5ea6 \u5e74\u5e74). In times of the threat of the plague, even that pleasure is over. All that remains is a feeling of helplessness and anger at a government that does not protect its citizens, but deliberately tramples them down.

Such an outcome would be similar to that of the last two pandemics - the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).\nBoth SARS, in 2003, and MERS, in 2012, which together resulted in over 1,500 deaths worldwide and had infected over 10,000 people globally, had minimal spread and no fatalities in the United States where the disease was met with containment efforts by public health officials.\nThere have been 11 confirmed cases of people carrying the 2019-nCoV in the United States, while 82 more people remain under investigation as of Feb. 3, according to the CDC{here}. More cases of human transmission are expected to surface over the next few days but all those affected are being quarantined and treated.\nLittle detail is now available on the cost of treating the illness and the severity of associated symptoms. Fitch said it will closely monitor the progress of 2019-nCoV, given its rapid transmission.\nLife insurers with a mortality focus would be at greatest risk if the spread accelerates, Fitch said in a separate note.\n\u201cTo-date, 2019-nCoV has not caused any deaths in the U.S. However, any event that might cause an increase in the U.S. mortality rate has the potential to be a negative credit event for U.S. life insurers in a severe scenario,\u201d Donald Thorpe, Senior Director of Insurance Ratings, said in the note.\nThe American Council of Life Insurers maintained that the industry\u2019s capital reserves will help it cope with a potential health crisis with large volumes of claims. Assets of U.S. life insurers were $7 trillion in 2018, down 2.7 percent from the year before.\n\u201cHow far the coronavirus outbreak will reach remains unknown, but life insurers are prepared to meet their commitments to policyholders,\u201d council spokesman Whit Cornman said.\nThe HHS has partnered with a New York-based biotech company, Regeneron to develop a treatment. Travel to and from China has been restricted after cases of human-to-human transmission were confirmed.\n*To read more by the Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence team click here: bit.ly/TR-RegIntel\n(By Antonita Madonna in New York, Regulatory Intelligence)"}, {"content": "Coronavirus: Philippines wants to postpone ASEAN para games.

On January 29 of this year, India reported its first positive case of the novel coronavirus. The patient, a student from Thrissur district of Kerala had just returned from Wuhan, China, regarded as the epicenter of the outbreak. Over the next few days, Covid-19 scare struck twice as two more students who returned from China to Kerala were tested positive for the infection.\nThe news of positive cases triggered a mixed response from the country. While some feared the worst, there were quite a few who were confident about Kerala's success story in similar events such as the outbreak of Nipah. In the end, the state health department ensured that all three positive cases walked out of the hospitals completely cured.\nThe first patient to be tested positive was a 20-year-old student hailing from Thrissur. She had been studying in one of the universities in Wuhan for some years now. She returned to Kerala on January 24 after the situation in Wuhan deteriorated. During screenings at the airport, she could not identify any symptoms and be allowed to go home.\nHowever, the student was being constantly monitored by the Kerala state health authorities. A few days later, on the morning of January 27, she developed symptoms. \"Things were all good for the first few days. But on January 27, I felt uneasiness in my throat.

The doctors did not tell me anything initially. I had already started antibiotics by then. On January 30, I started hearing news reports that the first positive Covid-19 case has been reported from Thrissur. Later that day, a team of doctors approached me dressed up in full bodysuits. They were extremely compassionate and explained to me about the results and reassured me that I have nothing to worry about,\" said the 20-year-old student.\n\"Since then, I was constantly monitored by a team of doctors and nurses. They always tried to ensure that I was not upset and interacted with me. I also helped them out with contact tracing. The initial list was the group of 20 who came with me from Wuhan. Since I took a flight to Kolkata and stayed in the airport for a day, they also traced all possible people who could have contacted me. Later I came to know one of my friends who travelled with me was also tested positive. She was admitted to the Alappuzha Medical College,\" she recollects.\nApart from contact tracing, the Kerala Health department was in constant touch with the patient and the family.

This Thrissur patient was not informed of her first test in which she tested negative. After the second consecutive test turned negative, the doctors informed her about the results. On February 20, the medical board met to assess the situation of the patient. After considering the results, they decided to discharge her. Though discharged, the girl had to undergo another 14 days of home-quarantine which ended recently.\n\"My home-quarantine period just ended the last day. It was indeed a tough time for all of us. But I was totally surprised by the way the machinery swung into action to tackle this crisis. I never thought a government system could be this efficient.

This means that 31,161 cases were confirmed, according to the Beijing Health Commission on Friday. It was the second day in a row that no more new infections were reported than the day before. Within one day, however, another 73 patients died of the novel lung disease - as many as the day before. There are 636 deaths in China. It remains to be seen whether the new figures show a trend in infections, as the statistics can also fluctuate with the number of ongoing examinations. From the perspective of the World Health Organization (WHO), the course of the epidemic is difficult to predict.

China must make profound changes to its public health emergency response system, President Xi Jinping said on Friday at a meeting with senior Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officials in Beijing, as the country continues to debate- with the crisis of the new coronavirus, which left citizens on the verge of a nervous breakdown and the economy paralyzed. Xi admitted that the CCP has to address a number of problems, flaws and weaknesses that have plagued the coronavirus. He spoke of the need to review laws relating to the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases and protection of wildlife (wildlife trafficking and consumption), and underscored the need to draft a biosafety law, reports Hong Kong newspaper South China Morning Post.

The emergence of the coronavirus, he continued, &quot;is a great test of our system and governance capacity.&quot; Xi&#39;s admission was the strongest so far about the failures of the Chinese emergency system since the outbreak in Wuhan province in December. Xi Jinping was forced to lead the response to the crisis, after a first phase in which he kept to the rear. It was forced to do so, due to the strong international reaction to the way the crisis was being managed, and the way Chinese citizens themselves reacted, on social media, to the lack of information about the mass quarantines imposed in 16 cities in the province of Hubei, with a total of 56 million inhabitants. The longer the outbreak lasts, the more the regime&#39;s credibility will be undermined.\u200b A sign that is expected to reveal this new attitude was the announcement, for the first time, this Friday, of the number of healthcare professionals infected with coronaviruses in China: 1716, of which six died. \u201cHealth care professionals face the challenge of caring for a substantial number of patients in Wuhan. It is disturbing to know that many have been infected,\u201d Benjamin Cowling, professor of epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong, told the New York Times. Chinese television has meanwhile announced that anyone returning to Beijing from another part of the country will have to remain in isolation for 14 days. Anyone who fails to meet this obligation \u201cwill have to respond in accordance with the law,\u201d says the New York Times. The communiqu\u00e9 was issued by a \u201cgroup of leaders\u201d of the CCP at the municipal level, not the national leadership. China hesitates between the economic recovery and the relentless fight against the new virus. After the Chinese New Year holiday period, people return to the workplace, but it must be ensured that they do not carry the infection with them. It is mandatory to wear protections to avoid transmitting the virus to colleagues - that&#39;s why you see workers wrapped in plastic from head to toe, and wearing masks.

The three cases bring China's total imported case count to 63. \n According to the Beijing Municipal Health Commission, two of the cases found in Beijing originated in Italy and Spain. \n As the virus slows its spread in Wuhan, authorities have reacted by closing hospitals built specifically to house its patients. \n After the first such closure last week, on Sunday, CCTV reported that operations at a second hospital had been suspended, with its 25 remaining patients now discharged and declared cured.

The term is associated with the geographic spread and not any characteristic changes in the infection itself.\nWHO officials have signalled for weeks that they may use \"pandemic\" as a descriptive term but added that it does not carry any legal significance. The WHO no longer has a category for declaring a pandemic, except for influenza. The novel coronavirus is not the flu.\nHowever, the term should not be confused with an outbreak and an epidemic.\nHOW IS PANDEMIC DIFFERENT FROM EPIDEMIC\nEpidemic comparatively affects fewer number of people and is confined to a certain region. An outbreak is usually the first stages of an epidemic. An epidemic affects a region or a country and starts infecting a large part of the population.\nThe word epidemic originates from the Greek word 'epidemia' while the word pandemic originates from the word 'pandemos', which denotes \"all people\".\nThe ebola spread was an epidemic that affected western Africa and resulted in the deaths of thousands over some years. The SARS outbreak in China was also an epidemic that killed over 800 people.\nA pandemic is when a disease rapidly starts spreading across the world and is no longer restricted to a community or region.\nThe world has seen a number of pandemics in the past involving diseases such as plague, influenza, yellow fever and others. The latest pandemic is the first caused by coronavirus.\nMore than 118,000 cases of coronavirus have emerged in 114 countries and 4,291 people have died so far.\nThe coronavirus, which emerged in China in December, has spread around the world, halting industries, markets, bringing flights to a standstill, prompting the latest oil price war, locking down entire nations, closing schools and forcing the postponement of events and concerts across the world.\nThe WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern, its \"highest level of alarm\", on January 30 when there were fewer than 100 cases of COVID-19 outside China. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the casualties and number of infected persons are expected to rise.\nIn the past two weeks the number of cases outside China had risen 13-fold, and the number of countries affected had tripled, a sombre-looking Tedros said, displaying little of his normally upbeat persona."}, {"content": "China delaying permission to India for sending plane to Wuhan: Official.

SHANGHAI \u2014 The food market where China's deadly virus surfaced was a smorgasbord of exotic wildlife ranging from wolf pups to species linked to previous pandemics such as civets, according to vendor information and a Chinese media report. \n The Huanan Seafood Market in the central city of Wuhan came under greater scrutiny on Wednesday (Jan 22) as Chinese officials said that the virus which has so far killed nine people and infected hundreds may have originated in a wild animal sold at the food emporium. \n Past deadly epidemics have been blamed on wild animals \u2014 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) was linked to Chinese consumption of civet meat \u2014 setting Chinese authorities up for potential embarrassment if lax supervision of wildlife trafficking is found at fault in the latest outbreak. \n A price list circulating on China's internet for a business at the Wuhan market lists a menagerie of animals or animal-based products including live foxes, crocodiles, wolf puppies, giant salamanders, snakes, rats, peacocks, porcupines, camel meat and other game \u2014 112 items in all. \n \"Freshly slaughtered, frozen and delivered to your door,\" said the price list for the vendor, \"Wild Game Animal Husbandry for the Masses\". \n Dr Gao Fu, director of the Chinese centre for disease control and prevention, said in Beijing on Wednesday that authorities believe the virus likely came from \"wild animals at the seafood market\" though the exact source remains undetermined. \n China bans the trafficking of a number of wild species or requires special licenses, but regulations are loose for some species if they are commercially farmed. \n AFP was unable to directly confirm the authenticity of the price list. Phone calls to the vendor went unanswered, and attempts to connect to its social media accounts were rejected. \n The Beijing News published a photo Tuesday showing the same vendor's now-shuttered store front, as authorities in white hazmat suits milled about. \n The paper also quoted other merchants as saying trade in wildlife took place up until the market was shuttered for disinfection shortly after the outbreak. \n A number of the early sufferers of the virus, now known as the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), were employees of the market. \n VIRUS \u2018SPILLOVER\u2019 \n Many exotic species are still widely consumed in China or other Asian countries where they are considered a delicacy \u2014 like the civet or some rats or bats \u2014 or for purported health benefits that are unproven by science. \n But this brings growing human health risks, said Dr Christian Walzer, executive director of the US-based Wildlife Conservation Society's Health Program. \n Dr Walzer said 70 per cent of all new infectious diseases come from wildlife, with habitat encroachment increasing the chances of pathogens spreading. \n \"Wildlife markets offer a unique opportunity for viruses to spill over from wildlife hosts,\" he said. \n \"It is essential to invest resources not only into discovering new viruses, but more importantly, in determining the epidemiological drivers of... (the) spillover, amplification, and spread of infectious diseases.\" \n Bats are thought to have spawned Sars, which in 2002-03 killed hundreds of people in Asia, mostly China. \n Sars was also found in civets in wildlife markets in China, with many scientists believing the bat virus infected the cat-like creatures and then humans who ate them. \n Following Sars, China cracked down on consumption of civets and some other species, but conservationists say the trade continues. \n China has so far won praise for its openness and handling of the current outbreak in stark contrast to Sars, when it was accused of stifling information and failing to cooperate with the rest of the world.

The new pneumonia-causing coronavirus originating in China has killed 131 people in China and infected more than 5,500 people worldwide, including a nine-month-old baby, but what is unknown about the virus is far more than what is already known. You know. The exact origin of the virus is still known, as is the host (animal) and whether or not there was an intermediate host. The form of transmission between humans, the exact period in which this transmission takes place and the rate of attack of the virus is not yet clear. In other words, to know the epidemiology of the new infection - Who, How and When? Here are some questions about the virus for which there is still no answer: What is the true attack rate? Although the number of infected people is growing daily, it is still not really known how far the virus is. Who are the most affected people? It is unknown whether the virus equally affects all types of people, from adults or children, sick or healthy, as the pulmonologist Filipe Froes, appointed representative of the Medical Association for issues related to the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), pointed out to the Lusa agency ). International authorities still do not know who has the most serious forms of the disease and what are the characteristics of those killed by this new virus. Pulmonologist Filipe Froes recalls that no serious situation has yet occurred outside China, despite all cases of the disease being imported. Does the virus affect children? And what is its expression in pediatric age? There is a case report of a nine-month-old baby infected by one of the parents, but it is not yet known whether the virus has affected children in the same way that it affects adults. What is the transmission period? Pulmonologist Filipe Froes recalls that Chinese authorities warned that there may be transmission between people even before the onset of symptoms. It is not known whether this is an exception or a rule and how long before symptoms appear the disease can be contagious. It is also unknown whether, similarly to what happened with SARS (English acronym for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), if there are patients with a greater capacity for contagion than others. It is also unknown what is the longest transmission period and even when it occurs. What treatments are there? Currently, patients are being treated with supportive measures, which only treat symptoms of the disease, such as fever or difficulty breathing. There is still no specific drug for this new coronavirus. Filipe Froes indicates that there will be experimental treatments in progress, but its effectiveness is still unknown. According to the specialist, a vaccine will already be under development, based largely on the work that had been done for 2002/2003 atypical pneumonia - SARS. It is still necessary to wait for tests on effectiveness and safety. What is the exact origin of the virus? The first cases of the new coronavirus in humans were linked to a fish and meat market in the Chinese city of Wuhan. However, it is not known which animal transmitted the virus to the first infected patient, nor if there was an animal that was the original host and another was the intermediate host. So what is known about the new coronavirus? Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that live in other animals (eg birds, bats, small mammals) and that in humans usually cause respiratory illnesses, from a common cold to more severe cases such as pneumonia. They can be transmitted between animals and people. Most coronavirus strains circulate among animals and do not even infect humans. In fact, so far, only six strains of coronaviruses among the thousands existing have crossed the species barrier and reached people. The new coronavirus is in the same family as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus (2002-2003) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (2012) virus. These two types of coronaviruses are so far those that have been able to cross the species barrier and transmit to humans and that present conditions of some severity, explained pulmonologist Filipe Froes to the Lusa agency. The first 2019-nCoV cases appeared in mid-December in the Chinese city of Whuan, when people with viral pneumonia began arriving at hospitals. It was noticed that all the people worked or frequently visited the seafood and meat market of Huanan, in that same city. The exact origin of the infection is still unknown, but infected animals, which are traded alive, transmitted it to humans. These viruses are usually transmitted through the respiratory tract and mainly affect the respiratory tract, especially the lungs in severe forms. Symptoms of these coronaviruses are more intense than the flu and include fever, pain, malaise and breathing difficulties. In cases initially confirmed, 90% had fever, 80% had dry cough, 20% shortness of breath and only about 15% had difficulty."}, {"content": "UPDATE 2-Pompeo says China still withholding coronavirus information.

MELBOURNE (BLOOMBERG) - A pneumonia outbreak in central China widened with more than 200 people now diagnosed with the new Sars-like virus, as health experts said there is now evidence that the illness is spreading from people to people. \n With increased searching and testing for the novel virus among people with symptoms like fever and coughing, the number of cases in China surged over the weekend. Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, now has almost 200 confirmed cases, with three fatalities. Cases were also reported in Beijing and the southern Chinese province of Guangdong. \n Across the region, South Korea detected its first case, according to news agency Yonhap, adding to those found in Thailand and Japan last week. \n The surge in cases, after the World Health Organisation (WHO) released guidance for diagnostic detection of the virus on Friday (Jan 17), confirmed suspicions that the illness is being spread from people to people. There are no reports yet of health-care workers being infected, a sign that the virus is likely not as infectious as Sars, which killed almost 800 people 17 years ago. \n \"It is clear that there is at least some human-to-human transmission from the evidence we have, but we don't have clear evidence that shows the virus has acquired the capacity to transmit among humans easily,\" said Dr Takeshi Kasai, the WHO's regional director for the western pacific, in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Monday. \n \"We need more information to analyse that.\" \n Countries across the world stepped up screening among arriving passengers ahead of the Chinese\u00a0New Year festival that starts this Friday, a period of heightened travel for Chinese people. International airports in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco started screening from late Friday, joining cities in Asia that implemented the surveillance measure days after the outbreak was reported on Dec\u00a031. \n In Wuhan, health-care workers spread out across the city of 11 million, screening for symptoms among people on planes and at railway stations. \n \"This is a situation where we're going to see additional cases all around the world as folks look for it more,\" Dr Nancy Messonnier, director of the US's Centres for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Centre for Immunisation and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters on Friday. \n \"It's highly plausible that there will be at least a case in the United States, and that's the reason that we're moving forward so quickly with this screening.\" \n It's possible that more than 1,700 people in Wuhan have been infected with the virus, Prof Neil Ferguson and colleagues at Imperial College London said in a study on Friday. Their analysis was based on cases reported outside China last week, with the assumption that it takes five or six days for someone to feel unwell after being infected, and another four or five days for the infection to be detected. \n The widening of cases sparked a rally in Chinese drugmakers' shares on Monday. Antibiotic makers Jiangsu Lianhuan Pharmaceutical Co, Shandong Lukang Pharmaceutical Co and Shenzhen Neptunus Bioengineering Co all rose by the 10 per cent daily limit in early trading. \n Shares of companies in the travel and hotel sectors dropped on fears of a hit to tourism over the Lunar New Year, traditionally a peak period of spending for China's billion-strong consumer force. Chinese airlines and Macau casino operators were among the biggest losers on Monday, with Air China Ltd sinking as much as 7.8 per cent in Hong Kong. \n The novel coronavirus, known as 2019-nCoV, has triggered alarm because of similarities with the one that sparked Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or Sars, 17 years ago. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some causing illness in people, and others that circulate among animal, including camels, cats, and bats, the CDC said. While rare, animal coronaviruses can evolve and infect people, and then spread between people. \n The source and transmission routes of the 2019-nCov virus are still unknown, China's National Health Commission said in a statement on Sunday. \n Some of the first group of patients in Wuhan worked or shopped at a seafood market where live animals and wildlife parts were also reportedly sold. \n The closed Huanan seafood wholesale market associated with the Wuhan virus cluster. PHOTO: EPA-EFE \n Provincial health authorities in Guangdong confirmed a case on Sunday in a 66-year-old Shenzhen resident who developed fever and fatigue on Jan 3 during a five-day trip to Wuhan. \n Two cases have been confirmed in Beijing, according to a statement by a local health authority on Monday. The patients, who have a history of travel to Wuhan, have been hospitalised and are in stable condition. \n Officials in Thailand reported two cases last week, while Japan confirmed a case on Thursday. All of them either lived in Wuhan or had spent time there, though none was linked to the seafood market. \n Health authorities said that as of 10pm on Sunday, 25 of the city's 198 cases had been cured. A further three had been discharged from the hospital. Currently, 170 cases are being treated in isolation wards at various hospitals, of which 126 cases are mild, 35 are severe, and nine cases are critically ill. \n Of the 136 patients reported over the weekend, 66 were male and 70 were female; the youngest was 25 years old and the oldest was 89. The most recent illness occurred before Saturday, and initial symptoms were mostly fever, cough or chest tightness, and difficulty breathing. \n Chinese authorities said the outbreak is \"still preventable and controllable\", in an attempt to reassure the public as hundreds of millions of people prepare to travel ahead of the country's biggest annual festivities."}, {"content": "Asian shares ease off three-week highs as coronavirus fears return.

SHANGHAI - Chinese scientists and health experts involved in the country's fight against the coronavirus believe the worst is now over, downplaying warnings that the disease could become seasonal or that a deadlier \"second wave\" could hit later in the year.  \n As the pandemic continues to spread overseas, a growing number of countries are bracing themselves for a worst-case scenario in which COVID-19 remains in circulation until next year at the earliest.  \n But medical advisers in China have expressed confidence that the country's strict containment measures have done enough to ensure that the outbreak can be brought under complete control, domestically at least, within weeks.  \n Though they remain wary of the risks of \"importing\" cases from overseas, they say China should be capable of eliminating COVID-19 in the same way it eliminated Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. SARS was eventually contained after the government imposed stringent screening and quarantine measures.  \n \"For me, a second outbreak (of coronavirus), a domestic outbreak in China, wouldn't be a great concern,\" said Cao Wei, deputy director of the Department of Infectious Diseases at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital.  \n She told a briefing on Monday that while China needed another month to make a final judgment, the existing prevention and control measures should be enough to bring the epidemic to an end domestically.  \n The World Health Organization has said the coronavirus reached a peak in China around late February. Zhong Nanshan, a senior government adviser who helped detect and defeat SARS in 2003, said it \"could be over by June\" if other countries take the required action.  \n On Wednesday, there were no new domestic cases in the disease's epicentre of Wuhan for the first time since the outbreak began. However, \"imported\" infections reached a record 34, and have outnumbered domestic transmissions for five consecutive days.  \n Ian Henderson, director of the Institute for Molecular Bioscience at the University of Queensland, said China's actions to contain the virus have been \"extraordinary\" but there could be a second outbreak, this time imported.  \n \"(What) remains possible is that as controls around isolation are relaxed in China, with a population that is still susceptible, then the virus may resurge if it has not been eradicated elsewhere,\" he said.  \n  \n DONE \"99 OUT OF 100\"  \n Gao Zhengliang, vice-director of the China Cell Biology Institute told the official Youth Daily newspaper that the country had now completed \"99 out of 100 steps\" required to defeat the coronavirus, though he warned that if global infections spiralled out of control, \"the costs and sacrifices China has made will be downgraded.\"  \n Some experts have referred to the infection patterns of the devastating 1918-19 influenza epidemic that killed more than 50 million people during three different waves, with the second the deadliest. However, Henderson said it was important to recognise the current virus was different from influenza.  \n Global inter-connectedness means that instead of coming in waves, new viruses are now more likely to spread and circulate until they mutate or until a certain level of immunity is reached. One crucial issue is how long a previously infected patient remains immune.  \n \"The number one point to get across is that in terms of the behaviour of this virus we are still very much in the dark,\" Henderson said. \"The issue around protective immunity is difficult to answer because we simply do not have sufficient information.\"  \n Some experts have raised the possibility that COVID-19 could become an entrenched seasonal illness along with ordinary influenza.  \n Preliminary studies have shown a possible correlation between the epidemic and climate patterns. A paper produced by researchers in Europe this week said the coronavirus preferred cool and dry conditions which could lead to seasonal global outbreaks \"much like other respiratory diseases\".  \n However, there have still been cases in warmer and more humid climates in southeast Asian countries, including Thailand and Singapore.  \n U.S. President Donald Trump has been one of many to suggest that COVID-19 could go away of its own accord as temperatures rise in the northern hemisphere.  \n However, Marc Lipsitch, a communicable disease expert at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said while warmer and wetter weather could reduce the contagiousness of the coronavirus, \"it is not reasonable to expect those declines alone to slow transmission enough to make a big dent.\"  \n Gao of the China Cell Biology Institute said given the higher fatality rate for the coronavirus, relaxing curbs was not an option.  \n \"The resolute curbs on the coronavirus must be continued, it absolutely cannot be allowed to co-exist with humans in the same way as the influenza virus.\" REUTERS"}, {"content": "UPDATE 1-Cargill bans international travel for staff amid coronavirus outbreak.

A deadly virus from Asia is spreading explosively around the world. States have strict quarantine rules, streets and shops are deserted. The mysterious pandemic with flu symptoms is killing more and more victims. MEV-1 is the name of the virus that becomes a global threat in the Hollywood thriller &quot;Contagion&quot;. Nine years ago, US director Steven Soderbergh released the disaster film with stars like Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Winslet and Marion Cotillard. Due to the coronavirus crisis, the factually staged thriller is suddenly in high demand again on streaming services. What was enthralling entertainment in 2011 now has a bitter aftertaste. The Covid-19 pandemic with the rapidly increasing number of infected and dead people shows more and more parallels with catastrophe scenarios \u201cMade in Hollywood\u201d. And the coronavirus is now scaring the entertainment industry. Hollywood darling Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson were the first celebrity couple to surprise with the news that they are both infected with Sars-CoV-2. The entertainment business is virtually paralyzed. Film and TV productions will be stopped, cinema releases canceled worldwide, trade fairs and festivals canceled. Industry experts anticipate box office losses of up to $ 20 billion this year if the stalemate extends over several months. The first slump came in January with the closure of the cinemas in China, the country of origin of the novel virus, which is also the second largest cinema market after the USA and Canada. In February, the temporary end for Tom Cruise and &quot;Mission: Impossible 7&quot;. For three weeks, director Christopher McQuarrie wanted to shoot in Italy, where the virus was already rampant. It goes on in rapid succession: At the beginning of March, the start of the new James Bond film &quot;No Time to Die&quot; will be postponed by seven months to November - &quot;after careful consideration and thorough evaluation of the global cinema market&quot;, so the sober reasoning. Because of the corona virus, the entire advertising tour in China had previously been canceled. In the last few days there have been other blockbusters: &quot;Fast &amp; Furious 9&quot;, &quot;The New Mutants&quot;, &quot;Mulan&quot;, &quot;Peter Rabbit 2&quot;, &quot;A Quiet Place 2&quot;. Fans now have to wait longer until these films come to the cinema. John Krasinski, director of the horror film &quot;A Quiet Place 2&quot;, commented on the delay on Instagram. You should experience his film together with other people in the cinema. &quot;Now is obviously not the time.&quot; After China, Italy, Poland and Germany, more and more movie theaters are also closing in other countries. In the US, most cinemas will remain open for the time being, but they will only give out half of the tickets to create more space and thus more distance between the visitors. The Hollywood studios are implementing the recommendation of \u201csocial distancing\u201d, ie keeping a distance from one another in order to avoid contagion, radically. The Disney studio announced a massive filming stop on Friday, thus avoiding encounters on the set. Major projects such as \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d, Guillermo del Toro&#39;s \u201cNightmare Alley\u201d and Ridley Scott&#39;s historical drama \u201cThe Last Duel\u201d with Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are affected. Filming for \u201cJurassic World: Dominion\u201d began in Hawaii at the end of February, and the set will now be closed until further notice, announced Universal Studios. For &quot;The Batman&quot; came the compulsory break on Saturday. Warner Bros. wants to interrupt filming in England with leading actor Robert Pattinson for at least two weeks, which has been going on since January. The streaming service Netflix also announced that it would cease production of films and TV shows in the USA and Canada for at least two weeks as a precaution. The positive coronavirus test at Tom Hanks had led to the immediate termination of director Baz Luhrmann&#39;s new production on the set in Australia. The biopic from Studio Warner Bros. is a still untitled biopic about rock and roll legend Elvis Presley, in which Hanks plays his manager Colonel Tom Parker. The two-time Oscar winner and his wife announced the diagnosis on social media on Thursday. You are now in quarantine and would &quot;take every day as it comes,&quot; said Hanks, stressedly relaxed. Industry experts in Hollywood meanwhile give a gloomy forecast. You are already projecting the possible billions in losses from the Corona crisis. The box office could miss $ 20 billion this year, especially if the lucrative foreign markets collapse, reported the Hollywood Reporter on Friday. In 2019, more than 42 billion dollars flowed into Hollywood&#39;s coffers worldwide. The annual CinemaCon trade fair, at which the movie theater industry wanted to present the latest Hollywood projects in Las Vegas at the end of March, has also been canceled. The renowned Tribeca Film Festival in New York and the International Film Festival in San Francisco (both scheduled for April) have also been canceled. These are bad harbingers for Cannes, where the 73rd film festival is (still) on the agenda in mid-May. A rejection would have a hard time affecting the already ailing international industry.

Although it may feel like ages, we are still in the early days of the Covid-19 outbreak caused by a new coronavirus.\u00a0\u00a0 \n As two old hands who experienced the struggles of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) pandemic in Singapore, we are gratified to see that preparedness systems are in place here and working well.\u00a0 \n The measures introduced have even been endorsed by infectious disease experts such as the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine\u2019s Professor David Heymann, who noted that despite causing inconveniences, Singapore \u201cis not overdoing it\u201d.\u00a0 \n Nonetheless, a crisis of public confidence is moving faster than the crisis of public health.\u00a0 \n Masks, hand sanitisers and disinfectants were the first to fly off the shelves. Even in our traditionally stoic society, a breach in our psychological defence occurred when some took to hoarding food and household items once Singapore moved to Dorscon Orange on Feb 7.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Can we succeed in beating this virus?\u00a0The answer is most certainly yes, and we are confident of the reasons why.\u00a0 \n UNDERSTANDING OUR INSECURITY\u00a0 \n Insecurity amidst uncertainty is to be expected. Many reports, some untrue, are making their rounds in chat groups, stoking public anxiety, doubt and fear. \n We are sad to see Sars revisited in many ways, with the old unfounded fears of infection prompting members of the public to shun healthcare workers and landlords to throw out tenants who had travelled to China.\u00a0 \n But Covid-19 is much less deadly than Sars or the Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers). Case-fatality rate measures the number of deaths among those infected and this is now coming out consistently to be much lower for Covid-19.\u00a0\u00a0 \n On the other hand, this disease is far more capable of transmitting between humans than Sars or Mers. Transmissibility is measured by its reproduction number\u00a0\u2014\u00a0cases directly generated from each case \u2014 and this is showing to be more like pandemic influenza. \n While social media can be useful, it also means that information can be overstated. Bad news spreads faster than good news. Media, which build in algorithms that prioritise sites similar to those often visited, compound biases in line with previous viewpoints and worsen fear. \n The authorities have been quick to provide timely updates and dispel rumours.\u00a0\u00a0 \n But people have different ways to judge the impact for themselves, with some even contemplating the \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d future state, such as Dorscon Red. Hence, expectations and beliefs honed from prior experience and observation of other countries contribute towards behaviours such as panic buying. \n The verdict on this outbreak is not out yet. Much attention is on the effectiveness of control measures in China. \n Some assess that disease incidence will decline into the warmer months of summer. Others believe Covid-19 will last longer, and possibly become endemic in a way similar to influenza.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Whichever the case may be, we can prepare for the worst while hoping for the best.\u00a0 \n Co-author Leo Yee Sin (right) briefing Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong during\u00a0his visit to NCID on Jan 31, 2020.\u00a0 \u00a0Photo: Raj Nadarajan / TODAY \n WHY WE ARE CONFIDENT OF SUCCESS\u00a0 \n Whether the outbreak lasts weeks or months, halting this outbreak in its tracks ultimately depends not so much on disease duration as on our collective resilience.\u00a0 \n Sustainability is key to preparing for a long battle. Support for each other is crucial to our psychological defence.\u00a0 \n When we recall events of 2003, the immediate impact of Sars was fear.\u00a0But out of this grew one long-lasting positive effect, in the form of a nationwide crash course on the importance of good hygiene practices.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Being a compact city state with a high population density, and dependent on global connectivity for our life blood, we have to accept many hard truths.\u00a0 \n But we are not helpless. There are many actions we can take together to safeguard public health and minimise the impact of acute events that endanger us.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Unwelcome as they are, public health emergencies will occur from time to time and they represent opportunities for us to derive valuable information not just about the disease threat, but also about ourselves.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Courageous volunteers are offering their skills and support in the community. Scientists are readily sharing knowledge to address the dearth of understanding on how Covid-19 originates and spreads. \n And we have dedicated healthcare and public health professionals, many with experience from Sars.\u00a0 \n In addition, Singapore's unique size also works in our favour. Many challenges are much more manageable in scale here than they would be in other countries.\u00a0 \n We have ample resources, invested heavily during peacetime. We also have the will to learn from our mistakes and stand together. \n These assets collectively constitute our urban health security.\u00a0Hence, we are confident of success. \n COMMUNITY-BASED RESPONSE VITAL\u00a0 \n New cases are being reported at an alarming rate in many places outside China. As global events unfold, the momentum of this disease is such that we can expect the outbreak (and case-fatality) to get worse before it gets better. Nonetheless, we remain optimistic. \n Just as with Sars, here is a chance for us to improve our community-based response with social norms of self-reliance, solidarity and cooperation. \n With concerns over rapid local spread, we must wash our hands regularly and if we feel unwell, wear a mask and avoid contact with others. We must also be judicious in the use of limited resources.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Inconvenience is inevitable, but we must be patient.\u00a0The virus does not discriminate, and neither must we.\u00a0 \n While we stay geared to fight, our spirits are uplifted by human stories of selflessness. We sense a groundswell of people motivated to strengthen our urban health security. \n Indeed, some of the panic buying ostensibly for one\u2019s own and relatives could be arising from pent-up emotions seeking ways to respond. Perhaps we can harness this for a greater good.\u00a0 \n Acts of kindness \u2014\u00a0people cooperating to give unused masks and hand sanitisers to others, and to cheer on frontline workers with food and messages of love and care \u2014\u00a0nourish our hearts with a warm glow of togetherness. \n The National Centre for Infectious Diseases and Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health have linked up with various groups to address requests on how to mount community-based responses, and clarify any misinformation on the outbreak. \n As the national crisis unfolds on two fronts\u00a0\u2014\u00a0public health and public confidence\u00a0\u2014\u00a0we see an excellent learning moment for all of us.\u00a0 \n The community is proving vital to Team Singapore.\u00a0Hence, connection and engagement with them in one whole-of-society approach should not be ignored. \n Once Singapore ceases its containment efforts and life gets back to a semblance of normality, we may yet be surprised that it happened sooner than we expected. \n \u00a0 \n ABOUT THE AUTHORS: \n Associate Professor Ooi Peng Lim is senior consultant with the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) and teaches field epidemiology at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.

Air India has already evacuated more than 600 Indians from the city.\nAt present we don't know what time the flight is coming. The only thing we know is that we are going to leave Wuhan tomorrow. We are only hoping that we come back to India soon.\nAll the buildings around my home are sealed. In fact, a university hostel close to my building has been converted into an isolation ward.\nMy Chinese neighbours are helping me to get food and drinking water.\nI have not spoken face to face with anyone since January 22. There are only nine of us in our building and they all are Chinese.\nLike us, they also stay indoors all the time. The fear is so palpable that no one steps out and talks to one another. Each of us thinks the other is positive for coronavirus.\nThe Chinese government hasn't ordered people not to interact, but the atmosphere of fear lingers heavily all over.\nThe Chinese authorities have asked people not to walk in groups and try to remain solitary.\nThe person who delivers food to us messages on the WeChat app and then at a decided time he drops food at the main gate of our building. We are not allowed to go and pick up the food immediately. After the delivery boy leaves, we are allowed to leave our flat after 30 minutes and pick up our order. This is a rule that everyone has to follow in the university campus.\nThe delivery boy fears we might have coronavirus and we, on the other hand, fear that the delivery boy must be carrying coronavirus so it is a cycle of fear where everyone fears each other. We are keeping a distance from everyone.\nOn January 24, I tried to walk around our campus. I saw a man walking towards me, but suddenly he changed direction, fearing he would contract the virus.\nI don't know how far things have improved in Wuhan. Yesterday, one Chinese news article stated that water in our pipes might be contaminated with coronavirus. I have no idea whether this is true or not. And therefore we have stopped using tap water too. We used to boil tap water and drink, but now we depend on bottled water.\nI have stopped watching the news because I get more worried after watching the news. I don't feel like working too. And even if I call my family back home, how long can I talk?\nI keep fearing the worst every time I feel feverish or sneeze leading to many sleepless nights.\nIf that wasn't enough, when you go to any store to buy medicines for fever, the employees inform the doctors and you are forced to go to hospital for a check-up.\nEarlier, they would check our body temperature every two hours to find out whether I have contracted coronavirus or not; that routine changed to one day a week and now they have stopped that.\nI believe we are in the safe zone now.\nRumour mongering regarding coronavirus is very rampant.\nSome say inhaling dust particles could lead to being tested positive, forcing many to shut their windows. However, how long can one stay in an air-conditioned room?\nWe cannot even dry our clothes as we have to keep all our wet clothes inside the room because we now fear coronavirus might enter through air.\nThe Chinese government is cracking down on people who are spreading rumours and till date 15,000 people have been arrested. The government is trying its best to control rumours, but they refuse to die.\nAnother rumour was that garlic water was a cure for coronavirus. The other was that if one drank whiskey or wine you wouldn't be affected by the virus. This resulted in a rise in sale of whiskey and wine. Soon, there was no whiskey and wine was available in Wuhan.\nI had a miscarriage and returned home on January 22. On that very day, the entire city of Wuhan was shut down.\nI am thankful that I came back on January 22 or else I would have been confined to a hospital which would have been worse.\nThe worst day for me was when the doctors came to our home to check whether we were infected with coronavirus or not. There were 10 of them, all dressed up like astronauts.\nI cried and cried because I felt if I am found positive for coronavirus I would die in China and never see my country again.\nLuckily, I was not positive. And rumours spread so fast on the university campus that we were detected with coronavirus which was untrue.\nThe only way to spend our time is the WeChat group all the Indians staying in Wuhan have formed.

He is hospitalized at the University Hospital Center of Porto (Hospital de Santo Ant\u00f3nio), in Porto. The second case had a positive analysis, but still needs to be confirmed, which will come out of the counter-analysis carried out at Instituto Dr. Ricardo Jorge. According to the Minister of Health, the patient is 33 years old, is also in a stable situation and began to have symptoms on February 26th. He does not have an \u201cepidemeological link to Italy, but to Valencia, Spain\u201d and is currently in the Hospital de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o, also in Porto. Marta Temido said that both patients were admitted to hospitals this Sunday. The minister promised to give notice \u201cas soon as possible if the second case is confirmed. Regardless of the results, the minister gave &quot;a message of reassurance&quot; and called for &quot;active surveillance&quot; to the population.

Health lines have been reinforced for this purpose. Gra\u00e7a Freitas reinforced that everything about the virus is not yet known. \u201cWe know something about other &#39;corona&#39; that circulate.

The Green Party Ecologist (PEV) this Tuesday delivered to parliament a bill that extends to all workers in quarantine, as a measure to prevent the coronavirus, sick pay paid at 100% of their salary. &quot;The Greens understand that the full payment of the salary must be extended, in the case of prophylactic isolation resulting from COVID-19, in order to ensure that it is extended to all workers, regardless of the employer, the type of contract. work, whether or not you are an employee, from the first day you are identified&quot;, says the PEV in a statement. The Greens consider &quot;it is essential that the State ensures that in the event of a contagious disease that puts the population and public health at risk, as is the case with COVID-19, that workers who enter medically proven prophylactic isolation, regardless of whether it is perform or not in a hospital unit, do not suffer reductions in their income&quot;. To this end, they delivered a diploma to the Assembly of the Republic that &quot;strengthens the sick pay in the first 90 days of temporary incapacity and protection in case of prophylactic isolation&quot;. In the preamble of the bill, the PEV recalls that the last governments have successively reduced the value of sick pay, which currently stands at 55% of pay if the leave is less than 30 days. &quot;The values \u200b\u200bof the sickness benefit vary according to the duration of the sick leave. Currently, they correspond to 55% (up to 30 days), 60% (from the 31st to the 90th day), 70% (from the 91st to 365 days .\u00ba) and 75% after the 365th day) of the reference salary. Therefore, the low is even more penalizing in the first days and months, leaving citizens, many of whom with low salaries, even more unprotected at an initial stage&quot; , indicates the text. For the PEV, faced with a situation of illness and the prospect of a significant decrease in income &quot;there are countless workers who, through superhuman efforts, literally drag themselves in their work, avoiding resorting to sick leave, which may even worsen even more the respective clinical situation&quot;. The Greens further justify this proposal not only with the need to &quot;protect workers&quot; but also to equalize quarantined casualties in the public and private sectors. &quot;It is not possible, however, to establish a different regime for workers in the private sector. In this sense, the full payment of the salary must be extended, in the case of prophylactic isolation resulting from COVID-19, in order to ensure that it is extended to all workers, regardless of the employer, the type of employment contract, whether or not they are employees, from the first day they are identified&quot;, they justify.

The outbreak of a new 'mysterious' virus named 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China has raised alarm bells among health officials the world over as number of people infected and the resultant death toll continues to rise.\nAs on January 21, six people have died and close to 291 infected by 2019-nCoV, a new strain of coronaviruses that is reported to have infected humans for the first time.\nThough health officials are still tracing the exact source of this outbreak, initial investigations have indicated it started at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan. Most of the infected patients in Wuhan had either worked or visited this market. It has been shut since January 1.\nOutside China, two cases have been reported in Thailand, one each in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea among people returning from Wuhan. The Philippines too identified its first suspected case of 2019-novel coronavirus on January 21.\nFaced with this new health emergency, scientists in China and elsewhere are brainstorming to find effective measures to identify the virus' source and contain its impact.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) has convened a meeting of its Emergency Committee on Wednesday to decide whether the outbreak should be declared an international health emergency.\nUsually, these declarations are made for epidemics of severe diseases that threaten to cross borders and require an internationally coordinated response. Previous global emergencies have been declared for crises including the ongoing Ebola outbreak in Congo, the emergence of Zika virus in the Americas in 2016 and the West Africa Ebola outbreak in 2014, the Associated Press reported.\nSeveral Asian countries, including India, have issued health advisories, and many have started screening passengers arriving from China at their airports. On January 17, three major airports in the US-Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco-started screening people arriving from Wuhan.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) too has said the infection may spread to other places, and has issued interim guidelines based on the limited information available about 2019-novel coronavirus. It has however not called for any trade or travel restrictions so far.\nWHAT IS 2019-NOVEL CORONAVIRUS?\nThe 2019-nCoV is a new strain of cornoviruses and has not been previously seen in humans. Cornoviruses form a large family of viruses and the illness they cause can range from common cold to more severe diseases such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).\nThese viruses are zoonotic, which means they are transmitted from animals to humans.\nWhile the exact source (i.e. the animal from which it started) of 2019-nCoV is yet to be identified, other strains of coronoviruses have previously been seen to be transmitted from civet cats to humans (in the case of SARS-CoV) and from dromedary camels to humans (in the case of MERS-CoV).\nThese aren't the only form of coronaviruses. There are many that circulate among animals but have not yet infected humans.\nThe WHO had earlier said there was no clear evidence of any human-to-human transmission of this virus, but on January 20, Chinese health officials confirmed they have identified some cases of human-to-human transmission.\nWHAT CAN 2019-nCoV DO?\nSince this is the first time 2019-nCoV is reported to have infected humans, there is limited information on the exact range of illness the virus can cause. Its effects can range from cough and fever to kidney failure and even death.\nThe WHO has listed the following common signs observed in people infected by 2019-nCoV:\nTo contain the viral infection, health officials in China have isolated the infected patients who are being treated at various medical institutions in Wuhan.\nWHERE DID THE OUTBREAK START?\nOn December 8, 2019, a patient in Wuhan city reportedly complained of pneumonia-like symptoms and sought medical help at a local hospital. Within days, many others reported similar problems, prompting health officials to launch an investigation.\nOn December 31, China informed the WHO's country office about these pneumonia cases emanating from \"unknown causes\" in Wuhan.\nTaking note of the matter and the limited information available, the WHO issued interim guidelines for all countries.\nOn January 7, Chinese authorities said they have identified 2019-nCoV as the cause of the pneumonia. However, experts are yet to identify the source of 2019-nCoV i.e. the animal from which it transmitted to humans.\nSix days later, on January 12, in a statement the WHO said national health officials in China have reported 41 confirmed cases related to this new type of pneumonia. Of these 41 patients, seven were severely ill.\nBy January 21, the number of cases rose to 217, with 198 in Wuhan alone.\nThese apart, two cases have been reported in Thailand and one each in Japan and South Korea.\nCASES OUTSIDE CHINA\nTwo confirmed cases have been reported in Thailand, besides one each in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea so far. All of these patients had recently returned from Wuhan and are being treated. The Philippines too has identified one suspected case of novel coronavirus.\nThe patient in Japan, a man, had travelled to Wuhan in late December and developed fever on January 3 when he was still in Wuhan. WHO says as per information received from Japan, the man didn't visit the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market (to which most cases have been linked) or any other live animal market in Wuhan. He has also denied having close contact with any person suffering from pneumonia.\nHe returned to Japan on January 6 and tested negative for influenza. When his condition didn't improve, he visited a local hospital on January 10 and a chest x-ray revealed abnormal infiltrates. Following this, he was admitted and on January 14, the doctor attending him notified his case to a local public health authority as an unidentified serious infectious illness'.\nWhen his samples were collected and tested by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, very small amount of 2019-nCoV RNA were identified.\nIn Thailand, the first confirmed case of 2019-nCoV infection was identified on January 13 (a 61-year-old woman) and the second case on January 17 (a 74-year-old woman). They had both returned from China.\nAs a precautionary measure, Thai authorities have started screening passengers at airports and thousands of passengers have been screened since January 3.\nPRECAUTIONS YOU MUST TAKE\nWuhan is a major city in China which is also a hub of international and domestic travels. Much remains to be known about how exactly the 2019-nCoV infection transmits between humans and animals, and the extent of human-to-human transmissions.\nThe WHO has issued an advisory to reduce risk among those travelling from or to the affected regions.\nMANY MORE AFFECTED THAN OFFICIAL FIGURES, CLAIMS STUDY\nAs on January 21, there were around 220 confirmed cases of infections arising from 2019-novel coronavirus.\nHowever, diseases monitoring experts in the UK have challenged this number and presented a study claiming that the actual number of patients infected can be much more than the official figures.\n\"It is likely that the Wuhan outbreak of a novel coronavirus has caused substantially more cases of moderate or severe respiratory illness than currently reported,\" the study said.\nSpeaking to BBC, Prof Neil Frugson, who was part of the study, said he was worried by the fact that three cases had been reported outside China (all comprising people who had been to Wuhan). \"For Wuhan to have exported three cases to other countries would imply there would have to be many more cases than have been reported,\" Prof Frugson told the BBC.\nTHREAT FROM YEARLY MIGRATION \nWith the ongoing festivities of the Chinese New Year, there is a heightened risk of 2019-nCoV infection spreading to other regions because in the coming weeks people (especially non-natives of Wuhan) will be travelling home for vacations.\nChina's Transport Ministry has estimated that nearly 3 billion trips will be made during the festivities which trigger the world biggest annual human migration.\nOfficials have said extra precautions will be taken this year due to the novel coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan.\n\"Transport hubs will strengthen disinfection, monitoring and prevention measures, Wang Yang,\" the Chinese Ministry of Transport's chief engineer, was quoted as saying by the Associated Press. \"The emergence of the epidemic may cause panic among people, especially in areas where people are concentrated during the Spring Festival travel period,\" Wang said.\nThe WHO too has said that the annual human migration for these festivities can increase the risk of 2019-nCoV cases being reported from elsewhere.\nWith inputs from The Associated Press and Reuters.\n(This article has been updated with latest figures as on January 21.)"}, {"content": "wuhan virus: a timeline of how deadly virus spread.

BENGALURU/NEW DELHI - India, the world's main supplier of generic drugs, has restricted the export of 26 pharmaceutical ingredients and the medicines made from them, including Paracetamol, a common pain reliever also sold as acetaminophen, as the coronavirus outbreak plays havoc with supply chains.  \n The Indian government urged calm and said there were enough stocks to manufacture formulations for two-to-three months.  \n The government's list of 26 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and medicines accounts for 10% of all Indian pharmaceutical exports and includes several antibiotics, such as tinidazole and erythromycin, the hormone progesterone and Vitamin B12.  \n It was unclear how the restriction would impact the availability of these medicines in the countries that import from India and also depend on China. In the United States, for instance, Indian imports accounted for 24 percent of medicines and 31 percent of medicine ingredients in 2018, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  \n FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn told U.S. senators on Tuesday that the agency is working to determine how the restrictions will affect the U.S. medical supply and the effect on essential medicines.  \n The FDA last week announced the first coronavirus-related drug shortage in the United States but declined to name the drug in question. Hahn said on Tuesday that drug was in shortage because of a lack of materials needed to make the API.  \n Indian drugmakers rely on China, the source of the virus outbreak, for almost 70% of the APIs for their medicines. Industry experts say they are likely to face shortages if the epidemic drags on.  \n \"Export of specified APIs and formulations made from these APIs... is hereby 'restricted' with immediate effect and till further orders,\" the Director General of Foreign Trade said in a statement https://dgft.gov.in/sites/default/files/Noti%2050_0.pdf on Tuesday, without explaining the extent of the restrictions.  \n \"Irrespective of the ban, some of these molecules may face shortages for the next couple of months,\" Dinesh Dua, chairman of the Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council of India, told Reuters. The council falls under the federal commerce ministry.  \n \"If coronavirus is not contained, then in that case there could be acute shortages,\" Dua said.  \n In a statement, the Indian federal government said state authorities had been asked to monitor the production and availability of APIs and formulations to prevent black marketing and hoarding.  \n U.S. drugmakers have said they are monitoring their supply chains and Mylan NV <MYL.O> warned last week that there could be drug shortages. Eli Lilly and Co <LLY.N> said on Tuesday it does not expect the coronavirus outbreak to result in shortages for any of its therapies, including insulin products.  \n  \n INDIA MONITORING PATIENTS  \n Separately, the Indian government said on Tuesday it had detected \"high viral load\" in six people who had been in contact with a patient who contracted the virus in New Delhi, the capital.  \n The patient in New Delhi was being monitored and was stable, the government said.  \n The six people have been kept in isolation and their samples are being sent to India's National Institute of Virology for confirmation, the government said in a statement https://pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=1604938.  \n Prime Minister Narendra Modi sought to quell public fears.  \n \"There is no need to panic,\" he said in a tweet.  \n \"Had an extensive review regarding preparedness on the COVID-19 Novel Coronavirus.

Novel coronavirus has tested the might of the world powers. The world is feeling the heat of the pandemic on multiple fronts. It is scampering to rescue humankind from grip of Covid-19 and facing an uphill task of preventing an economic collapse.\nWhile concrete data of loss in businesses and of employment come months later, the sentiment in the markets across the world is gloomy. This is reflected in the frequent crashes in the share markets in all parts of the world.\nThis is the biggest economic crisis in the world since 2008. Some people are already calling it the biggest since 1929-30 economic recession. Unemployment has risen in all affected countries. In the US, data point to biggest jump in people enrolling for unemployment benefits. In India, the worries are similar but there are no concrete data yet to support.\nThe only data reflection is share market. The Sensex is racing to go back to the pre-Modi government level in India. On Monday, the Sensex closed below 26,000-mark. It recorded the biggest-ever single-day fall of 3,934 points closing at 25,981. The Sensex had crossed the 25,000-mark barrier for the first time on the day the Modi government was voted to power in 2014 - on the day of counting.\nIn the past one month, the Sensex has broken record of biggest single-day fall five times. The current season of coronavirus-induced volatility in the share market has wiped off Rs 52 lakh crore of the investors. This is a picture in contrast from the high point on January 13 this year when the Sensex was racing towards 42,000-mark having crossed 41,952.\nThe template is same for all the major economies. In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission has enforced four circuit breakers in the Month of March. It is a safeguard that pauses trading for 15 minutes hoping the market will calm.\nCircuit breaker is a tool created in the US after 1987 market crash in which the Dow plunged nearly 23 per cent. Before being enforced four times this month, it had been used only once - during 1997 crash.\nSimilar panic has been seen in the UK, Germany, France and all Asian markets except China, the source country for novel coronavirus pandemic.\nChina's share market benchmark, Shanghai Composite Index (SCE) was at 2,915 on December 12. It was just before the news of novel coronavirus outbreak in China started surfacing. It reached the high point of 3,115 on January 13 and slipped marginally to 3,095 on January 20 when China for the first time officially admitted novel coronavirus outbreak with pressure building from within and outside the country.\nOn January 23, when it closed for Chinese new year holidays, it was trading at 2,976. It saw a major fall on February 3 when it opened after holidays were extended in the wake of novel coronavirus outbreak. Trading was closed before time at 2,746 point.\nInterestingly, China a day earlier had announced infusing liquidity worth of $173 billion into its markets. This kept the sentiments in Chinese markets in good spirit despite increasing cases of novel coronavirus in China through February. The result was the losses in Chinese stock markets were not as severe as outside.\nThe Shanghai Composite on Tuesday stood at 2,722 - not much below the pre-Covid-19 phase. The world has lost hundreds of billions during this phase.\nWhile Indian rupee has been fragile under the impact of novel coronavirus, Chinese yuan or renminbi has remained relatively strong against the US dollar. In the official basket of currencies, yuan has, in fact, climbed more than 4.75 per cent this year, which has been under the shadow of coronavirus pandemic.\nAccording to China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange, the average daily difference in the US and Chinese 10-year government bond yield is 172 basis points. This means the Chinese assets offers far more attractive returns for an investor.\nSimply put, China seems to be the financially least affected of all countries rocked by novel coronavirus pandemic despite weeks of lockdown. Share market data may not be the ultimate measure of economic impact of Covid-19. However, China is not known to put out adverse data in public. So, true scale of damage may not be known for years.\nThere is another explanation, however, for less volatility seen in China's share markets. Of the tradable share market capitalization in China, foreign capital accounts for less than four per cent. The rest is in the hands of the Chinese government, directly or indirectly.\nThe curve of Chinese stock exchange indices is also curious in the sense that China's was one of the worst-performing share markets before Covid-19 changed the world market outlook."}, {"content": "UPDATE 2-Marriott, Booking Holdings warn of virus hit as JetBlue waives cancellation fees.

The doctoral scholar in international relations at Wuhan's Central China Normal University had been instrumental in contacting the Indian embassy and arranging the evacuation of fellow Indians following an outbreak of the new novel corona\u00advirus (2019-nCoV).\nFor Sethuraman herself, leaving Wuhan won't be easy now. \"I didn't go to the airport because I knew I would not be cleared for the flight out. Even if I recover from the cold, once you are on the blacklist, you will not be allowed to fly out,\" she laments. Since the transport lockdown on January 23, Sethuraman has stocked up on essentials. According to her, stepping out is futile. One will be spotted by a drone, the building security cameras or police, and sent back indoors. \"The authorities aren't interested in testing or verifying if you have the virus. They are only interested in control...it doesn't matter if we live or die so as long as the virus is contained,\" she says. \"I am foll\u00adowing WHO (World Health Organization) guidelines, but there is no human interface to connect to. If people see you wiping your nose, they run from you, including the officials. That's the kind of panic and desperation here.\"\nThe travails of Vinay Ahuja, 38, who was visiting business associates in the region when the city went into a lockdown, are no different. \"Nobody expected it to escalate so quickly,\" he says, as he marks time before he gets permission to fly out. What Ahuja and many others are wondering is whether India would be able to replicate China's iron-fisted attempts to control the outbreak in a similar situation. China has been criticised by human rights groups, but received praise from WHO for its aggressive approach to control 2019-nCoV. The country built a 645,000 sq. ft emergency hospital in Wuhan in just 10 days. The two-storeyed hospital has 30 intensive care units (ICUs), 1,000 beds and special corridors to limit patient-nurse contact. A second hospital could be up by February 5.\nSeldom has an illness-largely a little-known respiratory disease-aroused such apprehensions as the 'corona', now part of the popular lexicon as a dreaded threat, eclipsing the pleasant connotations of being the aura around the Sun and a branded cold brew. First detected in December 2019, 2019-nCoV is a previously unidentified strain. It comes from the same family of viruses as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), which claimed 774 lives, including three Indians in 2002-03.\nThe situation in India is nowhere as grim as at epicentre Wuhan, though three cases had been confirmed until February 5, while 3,935 were under observation at isolation wards across the country, apart from the special camps for Wuhan returnees near Delhi airport. So, how prepared is India to handle the coronavirus in case the numbers spike?\nConsidering there is no vaccine or trial-proven drug therapy yet, aff\u00adected patients are being treated symptomatically based on clinical severity. \"Serious cases who have viral pneumonia will need supportive intensive care, including mechanical ventilation when required. Hospitals in large cities can provide this, if the numbers are not overwhelming. Small towns and rural areas in most states will be ill-equipped if the virus spreads further,\" says Dr K. Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI).\nThe public health system will have to go the extra mile to check the potential spread of the virus. Entry points to the country are being closely monitored to assess incoming travellers. There is still the danger of infected persons slipping through in the asymptomatic but infectious phase of the illness. Isolation of clinically-suspected cases is essential even where a specific virological diagnosis is not immediately available. Close contacts of affected persons are being advised clinical assessment and restricted mobility till the incubation period (up to two weeks) is over. \"Since the symptoms are not specific to this virus, a high index of suspicion is needed based on history of exposure to a proven/ likely case, even where laboratory facilities for a specific viral diagnosis are not readily available,\" explains Reddy. \"We have to educate the public with well-framed risk communication messaging and health advice, and all healthcare providers must follow the correct diagnostic/ clinical protocols.\"\nA comprehensive nationwide surveillance system is still a work in progress. While this network has expanded since the H1N1 virus threat loomed large a decade ago, competent labs are needed at more locations. In 2012, there was a proposal to set up 150 diagnostic and research labs with virology-related expertise. Of these, 80 are operable now, but this number is far from adequate. These are also not linked to the public health response system and only serve as support for ad hoc reporting.\nThough India has an integrated dis\u00adease surveillance programme in each district, this is done at a micro level and largely follows a symptomatic approach. \"We need case-based surveillance-where any suspicious disease outbreaks are reported to labs for real-time con\u00adf\u00adirmation. What we have is reporting at district levels based on extreme symptoms,\" says Dr G. Arun Kumar, head, Manipal Institute of Virology, one of four diagnostic labs under the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).\nDetailed investigations found that the SARS-CoV was transmitted from palm civets to humans in China in 2002 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) from dromedary camels to humans in Saudi Arabia in 2012. The animal source of the 2019-nCoV is yet to be identified. It's likely the source is a live animal market in China.\nLabs and the health system have also largely overlooked animal research and the risk mapping of India. There are several types of animal to human transmitted (zoonotic) diseases. They vary in terms of pathogen diversity (viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, helminths) and animal sources (bats, pigs, chickens, other birds, palm civets, dogs, fishes, crustaceans and snakes). India has fairly well-established programmes for monitoring zoonotic diseases like rabies, brucellosis and Japanese encephalitis. It is the threat of newer viruses, transmitted from wild or cap\u00adtive bred animals, that is most worrisome.\n\"To identify the emergence and spread patterns of zoonotic pathogens, we need a 'one-health' approach, combining research data from wildlife, veterinary and human populations involving biology, epidemiology and clinical studies. Surveillance of wet markets, involving sale of animal foods, has to be strengthened. At the same time, research needs to identify entry points of zoonotic pathogens from outbreaks in other countries,\" explains Dr Reddy.\nAgencies such as the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and the ICMR have advanced efforts in these areas. Yet, India is unequal to the task, be it handling an emergency or pursuing priority research. The weak links lie in inadequately integ\u00adrated epidemiological surveillance of zoonotic pathogens in forests, close-bred veterinary clusters and human population groups. This is one of the reasons why Nipah claimed 17 lives in Kerala in 2018. The dearth of virologic and taxonomic studies on native bats made it difficult to understand the nature of the virus. However, the state has learnt from the tragedy. Kerala has declared 2019-nCoV a state calamity and has kept over 2,000 people under surveillance at their homes. \"This is to tighten vigil rather than create panic. We do not want to miss out on any case,\" says state health minister K.K. Shailaja.\nThis level of vigilance has not been replicated elsewhere. Despite India being in the top 30 countries at risk from the virus, there has been no statement from the minister of health and no central guidelines for detecting and controlling infection. In contrast, European countries began tracking down visitors from China and putting out strong public advisories two weeks after the outbreak. Precautionary guidelines for the public in India are yet to be widely disseminated, in English or in local languages.\n\"There are all kinds of misleading reports giving the public incorrect information to help cure the virus. Most people also do not know how to protect themselves, which masks to wear, and so on. Public education has been entirely neglected so far,\" says Chapal Mehra, a public health specialist in Delhi. \"We need a proactive approach, not a reactionary one. Large-scale screening of risk individuals has to be a priority. It's a challenge for our public health system, which is yet to come out with a strategic approach to the issue,\" he adds.\nA concerted multi-agency response, led by a competent public health system, is the need of the hour, but it is currently hampered by the limited expertise in the country. In the medium term, agile outbreak response systems have to be built, primary healthcare facilities (where clinical assessments take place) strengthened and vaccine development efforts advanced.\nIf the virus does spread here in the same magnitude as in Wuhan, the impact on the economy, healthcare and public morale could be catastrophic. With one of the world's highest population densities, especially in urban cities like Delhi and Mumbai, maintaining three-feet distance between individuals (as recommended by the WHO) will be impossible, nor will the lockdown of an entire city be feasible. Meanwhile, social media broadcasts by individuals in Wuhan paint a grim picture. Shortage of food and medicines, panic and misinformation, depression, even theft-the virus doesn't just destroy health, it destroys society. It's already visible in Kerala. There are media reports of families of China returnees being 'ostracised'."}, {"content": "Global airlines start suspending flights to China amidst deadly coronavirus outbreak.

SINGAPORE \u2014 The Covid-19 outbreak is \u201cstarting to look like a global pandemic everywhere around the world\u201d, at which point it will not be possible to shut Singapore out from the world, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said on Friday (March 6). \n \u201cWhat we might do, even when (the disease) becomes more prevalent around the world, is to maintain some level of surveillance as we are doing today at the checkpoints to pick out and identify people with symptoms. \n \u201cThat might still be one level of control that we can do at the borders, but beyond that, we do need to do more within our own community in Singapore to slow the spread of the virus,\u201d said Mr Wong at a press conference by the Multi-Ministry Task Force that is tackling the virus outbreak, which he co-chairs. \n Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, who also co-chairs the taskforce; Environment and Water Resources Minister Masagos Zulkifli; and MOH director of medical services Kenneth Mak were also present at the conference held at the National Press Centre. \n Mr Wong was addressing a question about the continued relevance of border controls and travel restrictions, following fresh measures issued on Tuesday to bar the entry of foreign visitors with recent travel history to Iran, northern Italy and South Korea, which have been identified as epidemic centres for the disease outside China. \n \u201cYou have got to look at two categories: (The first) are the countries that we have already put in place travel restrictions, because we have identified these to be epidemic centres, starting with China and later expanded to a few other countries. To the extent that these countries take effective containment measures... then at some point in time, I think border controls to these countries will no longer be so relevant,\u201d he said, referring to China and South Korea. \n Mr Wong said China has been working hard to contain the virus and the number of new cases have gone down, while South Korea is taking proactive testing measures and is also vigilant in containing the spread to other cities. \n When deciding on whether to lift travel restrictions on these visitors, Singapore will consider \u201cif the situation within these countries is clearly very well contained\u201d and look at other data and evidence. \n The second part is whether to impose new border control measures, such as travel restrictions, targeting new epidemic centres of Covid-19, he said. \n \u201cI will not rule it out at this stage, but if you think and project ahead, and indeed if the virus is spreading and not that we have one clear epidemic centre and there are epidemics all around the world and it becomes a global pandemic, then there is no basis for putting together border controls unless we shut ourselves, which we don\u2019t want to,\u201d he said. \n Whether Singapore decides to impose these new bans depends on the evolving situation and the usefulness of such restrictions, added Mr Wong. \n \u201cAt that stage, the bigger risk is not importation of cases from these countries, but the importation of cases from countries that may not have travel restrictions\u2026 We are now seeing more cases coming from Europe, we are starting to see more cases in America, so it is starting to look like a global pandemic everywhere in the world,\u201d he said. \n Addressing a question on whether lifting these measures at a time when Singapore deems fit to do so would inadvertently cause a surge of visitors from places previously seen as high-risk, Mr Gan said it was important not to see Singapore\u2019s approach to border controls in a \u201cbinary way\u201d, since its actions have been incremental. \n This is evident in how Singapore has gradually ramped up its restrictions from Wuhan - where Covid-19 was first reported - to Hubei province and then to the rest of mainland China, he said. \n Mr Gan also noted how at the checkpoints, Singapore first rolled out temperature screening measures, and later increasing these measures to also conduct swab tests at the borders. \n \u201cEven for countries that we have border controls, we may adjust incrementally so it doesn\u2019t mean that if we open the floodgates (by lowering travel restrictions), everybody will come in overnight,\u201d said Mr Gan. \n He urged Singaporeans to keep up on personal hygiene efforts, emphasising the critical importance of the new SG Clean campaign launched earlier last month. \n A new taskforce, headed by the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources, was announced Friday (March 6) to encourage good personal hygiene, adjust social norms and raise cleaning standards across the country. \n Mr Gan said besides measures such as border controls, the SG Clean campaign is in fact Singapore\u2019s first line of defence. \n He said: \u201cWhether we have temperature screening or swab tests, it is not a hundred per cent. Even if we have restrictions on travel (from certain countries), we will also have Singaporeans coming back and we can\u2019t stop them from returning to Singapore. \n \u201cTherefore, personal hygiene and public health standards are the most important (moves) and that is why we need to push ahead with SG Clean,\u201d he said. \n GLOBAL PANDEMIC AN \u2018EMOTIVE\u2019 TERM \n The World Health Organization (WHO), although avoiding any reference to Covid-19 as a pandemic so far, has nevertheless called upon the world to be prepared for one. \n It currently refers to Covid-19 as a public health emergency of international concern. A pandemic, according to WHO definitions, refers to \u201cthe worldwide spread of a new disease\u201d. \n In a separate interview following the press conference, MOH\u2019s Associate Professor Mak was asked if Singapore would be making representations to the WHO on calling Covid-19 a pandemic. \n Dr Mak said the use of the term carries highly emotive overtones, as well as the notion that countries or continents have failed to control the spread of infections within their borders. \n \u201cAs the WHO has said, there is significant potential for a pandemic to arise, but we may not have reached a stage where individual countries and their local efforts to contain it have failed,\u201d said Dr Mak. He added that it is perhaps more helpful to look at how individual countries are stepping up efforts to control the spread of the virus, and how viruses transmits from one country to another. \n On its part, Singapore is collaborating and sharing best practices to tackle Covid-19 with other countries, he said. There is also the possibility to coordinate national strategies across borders on how to respond to the virus\u00a0\u2014 the health ministries of Malaysia and Singapore have formed a joint working committee to fight Covid-19, for example. \n \u201cThese are areas that we continue to look at seriously and we continue to be in discussion with international health authorities, our sister (agencies) in the region and further out, to see how we can share information and align our measures,\u201d he said."}, {"content": "WRAPUP 2-Airlines at centre of storm as coronavirus spreads.

The Bundeswehr quarantined more than 100 Germans after their return from the Chinese city of Wuhan in a barracks in Germersheim in the south of the Palatinate. They landed in a Bundeswehr machine in Frankfurt am Main on Saturday evening and were taken by several buses to the Air Force training location, which is now used as a quarantine station. The returnees should stay there under medical supervision for at least two weeks. The aim is to ensure that the coronavirus that broke out in China about a month ago does not spread further. In addition to the Germans, there were also 22 Chinese, an American and a Romanian on board the machine. Eleven of the total of 124 passengers were brought to the Frankfurt University Clinic after an examination at the airport - among them a patient for whom doctors cannot rule out a coronavirus disease. The other ten had other medical reasons, said Hesse&#39;s Minister of Social Affairs, Kai Klose. The authorities stressed that the risk to the population was low. At the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organization WHO an accumulation of pneumonia of unknown cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Just a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days later, a group led by virologist Christian Drosten from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers are provisionally calling 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. The Chinese authorities suspect the source of the pathogen to be a food market in Wuhan, where not only fish and seafood but also exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected. Both Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic in 2002 and 2003, around 8,000 people were infected and more than 750 died. Between its discovery in 2012 and the end of 2019, around 2,500 people were infected with the Mers virus, and every third person died from it. In total, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example. Several thousand people have now become ill in China, some of them - most of them probably with previous illnesses - died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first cases of infection outside of China became known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been to Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who was returning from Wuhan, and on January 24, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia, which can be fatal. Since it is a viral disease, antibiotics won&#39;t help. It is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after a dozen or so cases among medical personnel became known. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. As it announced on January 24, the World Health Organization currently expects that an infected person will infect an average of 1.4 to 2.5 other people. If these numbers prove to be true, the virus is less contagious than Sars and so is the flu. The WHO recommends following general hygiene rules: You should wash your hands often and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals. It is not yet possible to say with certainty. The World Health Organization announced on January 28th that around a fifth of the reported cases would become seriously ill from the virus, so if in doubt they would have to be treated in intensive care. According to reports, the first fatalities were patients, some of whom had serious previous illnesses. People with previous illnesses are also particularly at risk from other infectious diseases - such as the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, i.e. change their genetic makeup. That can make them more dangerous to people in the course of an outbreak - but also the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate that is as high as that of the Sars outbreak. So far, nine Germans have been infected with the new virus. In Bavaria, the Ministry of Health reported an eighth case of illness on Saturday, while Spain announced that a German tourist had been infected with the corona virus. The coronavirus has an incubation period of up to two weeks during which no symptoms appear. Nevertheless, there may be an infection. The Germans&#39; return flight from Wuhan sparked diplomatic tensions with Russia. The Bundeswehr machine was originally supposed to make a stopover in Moscow. Russian aviation authorities had promised a landing permit for this. In the end, however, Russia refused the stopover and justified this with the fact that Moscow Airport had capacity bottlenecks, said Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer (CDU). The minister announced a possible aftermath. The first coronavirus cases occurred in Russia on Friday. Like many other countries, Russia has therefore tightened entry requirements for the Chinese. The government in Moscow announced that travel groups from China who have been able to travel to the country without a visa since 2000 will be required to have a visa with immediate effect. In addition, China will no longer issue work visas for Chinese for the time being. The measures served the &quot;security of the country and the protection of public health&quot;. In addition, this should prevent the spread of the new corona virus. The government stressed that these are &quot;temporary&quot; restrictions. The People&#39;s Republic is Russia&#39;s most important trading partner. The epidemic continues to spread in China. The country saw the highest-ever increase in infections and deaths in a day on Saturday. The Beijing Health Commission reported an increase of nearly 2,000 new cases and 45 deaths. According to the authority, a total of 304 people died of the respiratory disease in the People&#39;s Republic. More than 13,700 people have been infected across China. The 45 new dead come from the particularly hard hit province of Hubei. From Wuhan, the virus has spread to 24 other countries. As the World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Sunday, an infected person died for the first time outside of China in the Philippine capital Manila. It is a Chinese from Wuhan. In view of the emergency, the European Union has sent twelve tons of protective clothing to China. As the EU Commission announced, the People&#39;s Republic had asked for the aids.

Chinese President Xi Jinping called this Thursday for the country&#39;s workers to return to their jobs, after nearly six weeks of stagnation, due to the Covid-19 outbreak, with a view to recovering production and domestic consumption. According to People&#39;s Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi made the appeal during a meeting with the Standing Committee of the Politburo, the top power in China. &quot;It is necessary to take measures to increase availability and encourage consumption of goods and services,&quot; he said. &quot;The country has registered positive developments in containing the outbreak and life and work must be resumed quickly,&quot; he added. However, in major cities across the country, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou or Shenzhen, the paralysis scenario remains. An investigation by the economic magazine Caixin revealed that companies and local administrations resorted to different ways of circumventing quotas imposed by the central government to recover economic activity, including manipulating the increase in electricity consumption. Business and local government officials cited by Caixin detailed how various indicators, including energy consumption, are being skewed by leaving machines, lamps and air conditioners on, even if there are no factory employees. Logistical problems in obtaining raw materials or moving goods arising from virus prevention measures, such as road blocks, are some of the impediments found by local companies and which also affect European companies operating in the country. According to the results of a survey carried out by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, nearly half of the companies surveyed predict a double-digit drop in revenue and a quarter estimate a drop of more than 20% in the first half of 2020. Joerg Wuttke, Chamber of Commerce president pointed out that the &quot;network of conflicting rules&quot; applied in the fight against the virus has produced &quot;hundreds of fiefs&quot; as officials and local committees adopt measures for themselves, &quot;making the movement of goods or people almost impossible in the country&quot;. Across the country, restrictions on the movement of hundreds of millions of people and forced closures of establishments were implemented. In Beijing and Shanghai, travelers from other parts of China have to stay at home for two weeks after returning from their homelands, preventing the immediate return to work of millions of migrant workers, who went home last January to celebrate the Year New Lunar and are only now starting to return to the prosperous coastal cities. The death toll in China from the Covid-19 outbreak surpassed the 3,000 mark today, with 31 new casualties recorded in the last 24 hours, Chinese authorities announced today. However, the country has been recording a consecutive fall in the daily number of deaths and new cases, which reached 80,409 today. Most of those infected and killed were registered in Hubei province, where several cities were quarantined, with entry and exit blocked."}, {"content": "Ban on leaving Wuhan takes the Portuguese community by surprise. &quot;It takes a lot of bad luck,&quot; the goalkeeper coach of Hubei Chufeng Heli, a club that competes in the third Chinese football division, tells Lusa. &quot;I came on Wednesday from the pre-season internship in Kunming (southwest China), just to pick up my bags, and this morning I was notified that I couldn&#39;t leave the city,&quot; he reveals. &quot;Motorways, rail and air connections, it&#39;s all closed,&quot; he describes. &quot;We can&#39;t leave here,&quot; he adds. Authorities banned entry and exit from Wuhan and two other nearby towns indefinitely, in a de facto quarantine that caught millions off guard, on the eve of the Lunar New Year vacation. The main celebration of Chinese families, equivalent to Christmas in Western countries, is also the biggest internal migration on the planet: according to the Chinese Ministry of Transport, a total of three billion internal trips should be registered during the next 40 days. Ant\u00f3nio Rosa, a Design and Art teacher at an international school in Wuhan, was also taken by surprise: &quot;I had been on vacation for several days, but I was waiting for my girlfriend&#39;s vacation, which starts on Friday, so we can travel together to Vietnam&quot;. &quot;If I knew what I know today, I wouldn&#39;t be here,&quot; he tells Lusa. The virus was first detected last month at a seafood market on the outskirts of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, which is also a major domestic and international transport hub, but has since spread to several Chinese provinces. The disease has been identified as a new type of coronavirus, similar to atypical pneumonia, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which between 2002 and 2003 killed 650 people in mainland China and Hong Kong. Initially, Chinese authorities reported only 41 patients, all in Wuhan, and ruled out that the disease was transmissible from human to human, but the number of infected has risen rapidly this week to reach 571 today, spread across 25 Chinese provinces, and killed 17 people. Miguel Matos says that in Wuhan, the seventh largest city in China, with 11 million inhabitants, the silence is &quot;complete&quot;, with &quot;establishments closed and streets empty&quot;. After notification from authorities, vegetables and other goods quickly sold out in supermarkets in the city as families hoarded groceries. At the gas stations, long lines also formed throughout the day. &quot;We went shopping, because we didn&#39;t have anything here at home, but we&#39;ve only managed to buy some meat,&quot; says the coach. Ant\u00f3nio Rosa reveals that the masks, whose use is recommended by the authorities to prevent contagion, quickly sold out in shops in Wuhan, and there are those who are taking the opportunity to sell them now for four times the original price. The professor says that, for the time being, the quarantine situation can be held up, but that if it goes on for weeks, it will be &quot;unbearable&quot;. Miguel Matos says he doesn&#39;t know how long the quarantine will last, but reveals that officials at a local hospital informed him that it could be extended until the end of March. &quot;What I was told is that there is not being overzealous, but that the situation is really serious,&quot; he says. Images broadcast on Chinese social media show the city&#39;s hospitals overflowing with people who flocked to undergo clinical analyses. Long lines also formed at the airport and train station as residents tried to leave Wuhan. According to estimates by the Lusa agency, six Portuguese live in Wuhan. Every year, the city also hosts dozens of Angolan and other Portuguese-speaking students at the University of Wuhan, one of the largest in the country in the field of engineering."}, {"content": "Hong Kong gives citizens money to counter economic weakness. Hong Kong&#39;s government has pledged billions in financial aid to the citizens of the Chinese Special Administrative Region because of the ongoing economic downturn. Adults with permanent residence in Hong Kong are to receive 10,000 Hong Kong dollars (about 1180 euros), the government of the metropolis said. Hong Kong&#39;s economy has been suffering from the effects of political protests and the coronavirus outbreak for months. Finance Secretary Paul Chan said in a speech that &quot;decisive action&quot; must be taken to address the city&#39;s economic problems. The financial aid from the city&#39;s multi-billion dollar budget is intended to relieve the burden on the citizens and at the same time stimulate consumption in Hong Kong. Overall, from the budget of 120 billion Hong Kong dollars (about 14.16 billion euros), 71 billion Hong Kong dollars are to be made available for around seven million people. Chan expects the measure to result in a higher deficit. \u201cWhile the budget is projected to be a record deficit for next year, I believe that only with such a budget can we help our community and local businesses get through their troubles,\u201d said Chan. When citizens receive money directly from the state without anything in return, economists speak of \u201chelicopter money\u201d. In the classic form it means that a central bank gives every citizen an equal amount of money. The US economist Milton Friedman is said to have used the image of such a rain of money from a helicopter for the first time. The idea behind it is that the residents spend the free money immediately and thus stimulate the economy. Critics fear that such financial injections will only arouse new desires and feed the idea that central banks simply have to print more money to solve problems. There is also the risk that citizens will not spend the money, but mostly save it. The demonstrations in the Chinese Special Administrative Region have been going on for more than half a year. The protests are directed against their own government and the Chinese leadership in Beijing, which is expanding its influence on the former British crown colony. Since it was returned to China in 1997, Hong Kong has been administered autonomously under Beijing&#39;s sovereignty on the principle of \u201cone country, two systems\u201d. Meanwhile, Hong Kong residents are also affected by the spread of the coronavirus epidemic. According to the World Health Organization, 81 people have already been infected with the novel corona virus, and two people have died.

With the very notable absence of high-level delegations from China (which was represented by the ambassador in the Saudi capital), Russia and the United Kingdom, the tone of the meeting followed the analysis of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which, for now, points to a \u201crelatively minor and fleeting\u201d impact on the global economy. Kristalina Georgieva, director general of the Fund, in her intervention before the G20, said that she estimates that the global impact of this unexpected health emergency is only 0.1 percentage points in world GDP, maintaining growth in 2020 above 3%. The IMF predicts that China will return to \u201cnormal\u201d in the second quarter of the year. Beijing tunes to the same tuning fork. President Xi Jinping acknowledged this weekend that the impact &quot;will be relatively large&quot;, but assured that it will be &quot;short term and manageable&quot;. However, the director-general of the IMF in Riyadh said the IMF had already revised downwards its forecast for China&#39;s growth in 2020 to 5.6%, a cut of 0.4 percentage points from the projection announced in January. Chinese growth would come down this year from the political and psychological threshold of 6%. However, the risk of a global pandemic began to rise. A team of 20 academics from Imperial College, London, on Friday published a study that is frightening many investors. According to the epidemiological model used by scientists, 2/3 of those initially infected with the Wuhan coronavirus may have left China even before containment measures were imposed by Chinese authorities in January. South Korea this weekend raised the alert level to the maximum and the Seoul stock market plunged 3.9% this Monday. Fear of the effects on the Chinese economy and regional production chains sparked panic in Sydey as the Australian stock market dropped more than 2%, with A$51 billion in losses this Monday. The Tokyo Stock Exchange was closed because it was a holiday for the Emperor&#39;s birthday. Europe was shaken by the outbreak of the coronavirus in Italy (with 10 cities under quarantine in Lombardy and Veneto) and the European Commission now fears that borders close within the Union space. European stock exchanges opened this Monday in red, with Milan square leading the falls, with the MIB index losing more than 3.5% in the first few minutes of opening. Remember that Italy is the most fragile economy in the Union and in the euro zone, having registered a growth of only 0.2% in 2019. The IMF forecasts advanced in January - even before the coronavirus alarm - point to a much faster weak economy in the Italian economy in 2020 (0.3%) and 2021 (0.6%)."}, {"content": "Coronavirus: China's envoy to US breaks with foreign ministry on virus origins. WASHINGTON (BLOOMBERG) - China's ambassador to the US reaffirmed his opposition to promoting theories that the virus that causes Covid-19 originated in an American military lab, in an unusual break with the country's foreign ministry. \n Chinese Ambassador Cui Tiankai said in an interview with Axios On HBO\u00a0that he stood by his Feb 9 statement that it would be \"crazy\" to spread such theories. \n Since his original remarks, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing has repeatedly posted statements speculating about a possible US origin for the virus, which was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. \n \"Such speculation will help nobody. It's very harmful,\" Mr Cui said in the interview that aired on Sunday (March 22). \n \"Eventually, we must have an answer to where the virus originally came from. But, this is the job for the scientists to do, not for diplomats.\" \n Mr Cui's comments represent a sharp public rebuke to Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, who has publicly questioned whether the virus originated in China and even touted the idea that it may have been introduced by US Army athletes. \n Such public differences are rare among Chinese officials, who are famous for their ability to stick closely to the Communist Party's official line. \n Mr Cui is appointed directly by President Xi Jinping and holds a vice-ministerial rank in China's political hierarchy. \n That makes him two levels senior to Mr Zhao, whose official title is deputy director of the foreign ministry's Information Department. \n Mr Zhao continued to promote the theory on Sunday, retweeting speculation from a Twitter user who goes by the name \"the lizard king\" that Covid-19 has been around in America \"for a while\". \n The user is described as an \"fl transplant to the desert\", a \"mama\" and \"not an expert\". \n The ministry spokesman's statements have been echoed in official state media in recent days and have provoked anger in Washington. \n President Donald Trump has taken to calling the pathogen the \"Chinese virus\" and has blamed the US's outbreak on the Asian country's early failures to control the disease. \n \"As you know China tried to say at one point -- maybe they stopped now -- that it was caused by American soldiers,\" Mr Trump told reporters March 18. \"That can't happen. It's not going to happen, not as long as I'm president. It comes from China.\" \n Meanwhile, China has also found itself in a tit-for-tat with the Trump administration over foreign journalists in Beijing. \n Last week, authorities in the foreign ministry expelled at least 13 American journalists from Beijing and forced at least seven Chinese nationals to stop working for American news outlets there. \n Asked by Axios about Mr Zhao's comments, Mr Cui referred the question back to the spokesman and his authority as ambassador to speak on behalf of the Chinese government. \n \"Maybe you could go and ask him,\" Mr Cui said. \"I'm here representing my head of the state and my government.\""}, {"content": "Coronavirus pandemic: First death reported in Pakistan, cases mount to 193.

(Reuters) - The coronavirus-hit Chinese economy will grow at its slowest rate since the financial crisis in the current quarter, according to a Reuters poll of economists who said the downturn will be short-lived if the outbreak is contained.\nA Feb. 7-13 Reuters poll of 40 economists based in mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, as well as Europe and the United States, predicted China\u2019s annual economic growth in the first quarter of 2020 to slump to 4.5% from 6.0% in the previous quarter.\nThat drop was expected to drag down the full-year growth rate in 2020 to 5.5% from 6.1% in 2019, its weakest since at least 1990 when comparable records began.\nHowever, economists were optimistic the economy would bounce back as soon as the second quarter, with growth then forecast to recover to a median 5.7%, according to the poll.\nThat figure was pushed higher by several optimistic forecasts from economists based in mainland China. The range was 2.9%-6.5%.\nThe coronavirus was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan - a nerve center in the global supply chain with a population of just under 11 million - and so far has claimed over 1,300 lives in China. That outstrips fatalities from the SARS outbreak in 2002-03 which killed 774 people worldwide.\n\u201cNobody knows the damage China\u2019s virus containment efforts will have on growth, and we probably never will for sure, given the opacity of the statistics. We reckon true GDP growth will fall below 2% in Q1, from 4.0% in Q4, which already was substantially lower than the official 6.0%,\u201d said Freya Beamish, chief Asia economist at Pantheon in London.\n\u201cThe lost production probably will be made up over the remainder of this year. But some service sector activity simply will be lost... people aren\u2019t going to get their hair cut twice because they missed getting it cut in Q1, or buy two coffees to make up for missed consumption.\u201d\n(Reuters poll graphic on coronavirus impact on the Chinese economy - here)\nThe enforced shutdown started during the Lunar New Year - usually the busiest time for most services businesses and according to most economists will accelerate an already-noticeable downturn before the outbreak.\nWhen asked to comment on what would happen to the economy if Chinese authorities failed to contain the virus from spreading rapidly, some mainland economists were reluctant to respond.\nGrowth was expected to slow to 3.5% in the first quarter in a worst-case scenario, according to a median from 15 economists in response to a separate question, with forecasts ranging between zero and 5.5%.\n\u201cI think the virus will be under control by April. However, in the worst-case scenario, growth may fall to 2-3% in the first quarter and to 5% in (full-year) 2020,\u201d said Bingnan Ye, senior macroeconomic analyst at Bank of China International in Beijing.\nTheir 2020 forecast matched the median worst-case outcome and lined up with the Chinese government\u2019s forecast for the full-year economic growth rate to fall as much as 1 percentage point in 2020.\n\u201cWe do not expect a speedy recovery for the economy, even in the unlikely event that there are no new confirmed cases. After the coronavirus has been contained, it may still take four quarters to see a full recovery,\u201d said Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING in Hong Kong.\n\u201cCompared to 2003\u2019s SARS, this is a lot more damaging.\u201d\nSince then, China\u2019s economic composition has changed significantly to become a more consumption and service-driven economy from being the world\u2019s factory before.\nChina\u2019s share of the global economy has quadrupled to 16% since the SARS outbreak, so any major disruption to economic activity is likely to have a bigger impact on the world economy now.\n\u201cEvery day is a deadline in February as Wuhan coronavirus data roll in,\u201d noted Lee Hardman, currency strategist at MUFG, the most accurate forecaster for Asian currencies in 2019. \u201cFor the yuan, the overall depreciation story continues.\u201d\n(Reuters poll graphic on China economic outlook - here)"}, {"content": "What you need to know about the nameless Chinese virus: the risks, precautions and how Portugal is prepared. News of the appearance of a new virus in a fish and seafood market in Wuhan, a city in central China, has caused international alarm. Memories about SARS and MERS, two other coronaviruses, are still fresh. Both, which emerged in the present century, caused a high number of deaths before finally being brought under control. The new virus, which for now has no name but causes familiar symptoms such as fever and breathing difficulties and has already led to dozens of pneumonias, does not seem to have the same potential to kill. Of the infected people already confirmed, one died and it was someone who was already seriously weakened by other illnesses. Of more than 700 people who have had contact with patients, including health professionals, none appears to have been contaminated. However, the possibility of limited transmission within families is not ruled out, and this week the World Health Organization warned hospitals around the world that the new virus could spread \u2013 a fear heightened by the huge displacement of people who will accompany the Chinese New Year celebrations until January 25th. In Portugal, the Directorate-General for Health said this Wednesday that there is no cause for alarm. Expresso spoke with Raquel Guiomar, who recommends: \u201cWhenever someone goes to a hospital or a doctor&#39;s office and has a respiratory infection, they should mention if they have made a recent trip, namely to China, where cases of this virus have been identified\u201d. What measures are being taken by the Ricardo Jorge Institute to face the potential threat of this virus? At the level of laboratory diagnosis, which is the mission of this institute, we are following all the indications given by international networks, namely by the World Health Organization, and we are establishing specific laboratory diagnosis for this coronavirus. The WHO-recommended diagnosis was released on Tuesday and we are rolling it out to make it available quickly. In addition to diagnosis, we are following other WHO guidelines. In all suspected cases, and linked to the origin of the outbreak, in China, these patients and their products will be tested for the most common viral agents that are associated with respiratory infections - and of which the institute has a large number of diagnoses, namely influenza, other human coronaviruses, adenoviruses for influenza, and also the coronaviruses that have been associated with outbreaks in the early 2000s and now more recently, especially MERS and SARS coronaviruses. In all these suspected cases, it is also recommended to carry out a search for bacterial respiratory agents and even other agents, such as opportunistic fungi. This will be, therefore, the follow-up. The institute has also already implemented a methodology that allows the genome of bacteria, viruses or fungi in biological samples and that will allow the identification of this new virus. What symptoms can lead a person to draw attention as a possible carrier of the new virus? What has been recommended, not only to clinicians, but also to patients, is that, whenever someone goes to a hospital or a doctor&#39;s office and has a respiratory infection, they should mention if they have made a recent trip, namely to China, where cases of this virus were identified. And, as was done in suspected cases of MERS coronavirus, it must be ensured that until the laboratory diagnosis is confirmed \u2013 as a negative or positive case \u2013 the patient remains in isolation. This assessment is carried out by the General Directorate of Health and by the doctors who have this function. The first information was that it had not yet been confirmed that the virus could be transmitted between humans. However, there was the case of that person who did not pass through the market in Wuhan, where the outbreak would have started, and yet contracted the virus. After all, can there be human-to-human transmission?"}, {"content": "south africa's ramaphosa declares state of disaster over covid-19. CAPE TOWN - South African president Cyril Ramaphosa declared a national state of disaster on Sunday as he announced a range of measures to contain a COVID-19 outbreak that has so far infected 61 and showed the first signs of internal transmission.  \n In a live television broadcast after a special cabinet meeting, Ramaphosa said the outbreak, first detected on March 5, could have a significant and \"potentially lasting\" impact on a struggling economy, which is already in recession.  \n Measures to be taken include travel bans to countries such as Italy, Germany, China and the United States. The government will also prohibit gatherings of more than 100 people and cancel large events and celebrations, he said.  \n \"It is concerning we are now dealing with internal transmission of the virus. This situation calls for an extraordinary response, there can be no half measures,\" Ramaphosa said.  \n He said government has cancelled visas to visitors from high-risk countries from Sunday, with previously granted visas also revoked.  \n \"Any foreign national who has visited high-risk countries in the past 20 days will be denied a visa,\" he said, adding that South Africans who visited targeted countries would be subjected to testing and quarantine when returning home.  \n First detected two weeks ago with a single positive result, the number of cases has risen to 61 by Sunday, a mushrooming rate that mirrors the rapid spread of the virus worldwide.  \n The health ministry said earlier it had conducted 1,476 tests, with no fatalities. On Sunday, one of South Africa's top universities, Wits in the economic heartland Gauteng, instructed 350 students to immediately self-quarantine for two weeks after a classmate tested positive for COVID-19.  \n Besides the health impacts, Ramaphosa said the economy would not be spared as exports decline in key markets, including China, and the labour-intensive tourism sector suffers.  \n \"Cabinet is therefore in the process of finalising a comprehensive package of interventions to mitigate the expected impact of COVID-19 on the economy,\" he said.

BANGKOK (AP) \u2013 News that a new virus that has afflicted hundreds of people in central China can spread between humans has rattled financial markets and raised concern it might wallop the economy just as it might be regaining momentum.Health authorities across Asia have been stepping up surveillance and other precautions to prevent a repeat of the disruptions and deaths during the 2003 Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis, which caused USD40 billion-USD50 billion in losses from reduced travel and spending.The first cases of what has been identified as a novel coronavirus were linked to a seafood market in Wuhan, suggesting animal-to-human transmission, but it now is also thought to be spread between people. As of yesterday, some 440 people were confirmed infected and nine had died from the illness, which can cause pneumonia and other severe respiratory symptoms.A retreat in financial markets on Tuesday was followed by a rebound yesterday, as investors snapped up bargains. Share benchmarks were mostly higher, with Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng gaining 1.1 per cent and the Shanghai Composite index advancing 0.4 per cent. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 jumped 0.7 per cent.While the new virus appears much less dangerous than SARS, \u201cthe most significant Asia risk could lie ahead as the regional peak travel season takes hold, which could multiply the disease diffusion,\u201d said Chief Asian strategist for AxiCorp Stephen Innes. \u201cSo, while the risk is returning to the market, the lights might not turn green until we move through the Lunar New Year travel season to better gauge the coronavirus dispersion.\u201dThe 2003 outbreak of SARS in China, along with cases of a deadly form of bird flu, resulted in widespread quarantine measures in many Chinese cities and in Hong Kong. More than 8,000 people fell sick and just under 800 people died, a mortality rate of under 10 per cent.While the ordinary flu kills hundreds of thousands of people each year, such new diseases raise alarm due to the uncertainties over how deadly they might be and how they might spread. That\u2019s especially true during the annual mass travel of the Lunar New Year festival, which begins this week.\u201cThe cost to the global economy can be quite staggering in negative GDP terms if this outbreak reaches epidemic proportions as until this week, the market was underestimating the potential of the flu spreading,\u201d Innes said in a report.In China, health officials stepped up screening for fevers. \u201cWe ask the public to avoid crowds and minimise the public gatherings to reduce the possibility of cross infection,\u201d Deputy Director of the National Health Commission Li Bin said yesterday. Just as with SARS, though, the impact of the disease is likely to fall heaviest on specific industries, such as hotels and airlines, railways and other leisure businesses and retailers, analysts said. Most declined on Tuesday but rebounded yesterday as investors locked in profits ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday. The outbreak is a boon, meanwhile, for pharmaceutical companies and makers of protective masks and other medical gear.\u201cIf the pneumonia couldn\u2019t be contained in the short term, we expect China\u2019s retail sales, tourism, hotel and catering, travel activities likely to be hit, especially in the first and second quarters,\u201d said Ning Zhang of UBS. Government efforts to offset the shock would help, but growth will likely rebound less than earlier forecast, Zhang said.As of January 17, the World Health Organization (WHO) had not recommended any international restrictions on travel but urged local authorities to work with the travel industry to help prevent the disease from spreading while warning travellers who fall ill to seek medical attention.The illness is yet another blow for Hong Kong, whose economy is reeling from months of often violent anti-government protests. The wider concern is China, where the economy grew at a 30-year low 6.1 per cent annual pace in 2019. An interim trade pact between Beijing and Washington had raised hopes that some pressure from tensions between the two biggest economies might ease, and the latest data have showed signs of improved demand for exports. The virus outbreak raises the risk such optimism might be premature.\u201cAccording to our analysis of the spread of the SARS virus, which so far appears very similar to 2019-nCoV (the new virus), we expect increased downward pressure on China\u2019s growth, particularly in the services sector,\u201d Ting Lu and other analysts at Nomura in Hong Kong said in a commentary.The growing number of global travellers has contributed to the spread of various diseases in recent years, including Middle East respiratory syndrome, the Ebola and Zika viruses, the plague, measles and other highly contagious illnesses.The World Economic Forum estimates that pandemics \u2014 cross-border outbreaks like the flu that killed 50 million people a century ago \u2014 have the potential to cause a USD570 billion in annual economic losses.The 2014-16 Ebola virus epidemic caused losses amounting to over USD2.2 billion, according to the World Bank. That includes a 40 per cent decrease in the number of working Liberians at the height of the crisis, lower exports and harvests, and costs for combating the disease."}, {"content": "US army might have brought coronavirus to Wuhan, says China government spokesperson.

US owe us an explanation!\" Zhao tweeted on Thursday with a video clip of the CDC director's comments.\nHe, however, did not elaborate his allegation against the US army.\nOn March 5, Zhao told a media briefing that the origin of the virus is yet to be determined, raising question over reports that the virus had originated from a live animals market in Wuhan in December.\n\"It is yet undetermined where the virus originated. Wherever its origin may be, China and all the other affected countries are victims faced with the challenge in containing its spread,\" Zhao said.\nAsked on Thursday at a media briefing here whether China has proof that the coronavirus didn't originate in China and if so, where did it originate, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said the \"origin of the virus can only be determined by science. We need to rely on scientific and professional views. We don't hope to see anyone making an issue out of this to stigmatise other countries.\"\n\"With COVID-19 developing into a pandemic, the world should come together to fight it instead of levelling accusations and attacks against each other, which is not constructive at all,\" Geng said.\nWhen asked about US President Donald Trump's televised speech on Thursday in which he said that coronavirus started in China and spread to other places, Geng said China has been \"acting in an open, transparent and highly responsible way since the outbreak of the epidemic\".\n\"We have taken the most comprehensive, rigorous and thorough measures in this all-out, people's war against the epidemic. Such extraordinary efforts have resulted in a growing positive momentum in epidemic control across the country,\" he said.\nOn Monday, Geng condemned US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for branding the coronavirus as \"Wuhan virus\" terming his remarks as \"despicable behaviour\" and an attempt to stigmatise the Communist country.\nThe deadly virus that first originated in Wuhan in December last has claimed over 4,600 lives and infected more than 124,330 people across 118 countries and territories.\nChina remains the hardest-hit with more than 80,000 infections and 3,100 deaths."}, {"content": "WRAPUP 13-China's Wuhan shuts down transport as global alarm mounts over virus spread.

Cases have been detected as far away as the United States.\nContrasting with its secrecy over the 2002-03 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people, China\u2019s communist government has this time given regular updates to try to avoid panic as millions travel for the Lunar New Year.\nAfter a meeting at its Geneva headquarters on Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it would decide on Thursday whether to declare the outbreak a global health emergency, which would step up the international response.\nIf it does so, it will be the sixth international public health emergency to be declared in the last decade.\n\u201cThis is an evolving and complex situation,\u201d said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\nAs it seeks to stop the spread of the virus, Wuhan\u2019s local government said it would close all urban transport networks and suspend outgoing flights from the city as of 10 a.m. on Thursday (0200 GMT), state media reported, adding that the government said citizens should not leave the city unless there were special circumstances.\nThe measure was intended to \u201ceffectively cut off the transmission of the virus, resolutely curb the spread of the epidemic, and ensure the health and safety of the people,\u201d state media cited Wuhan\u2019s virus task-force as saying.\nWuhan\u2019s move was praised by Ghebreyesus as a \u201cvery strong\u201d measure that could minimize the risk of contagion.\n\u201cIf Wuhan is taking such drastic measures, we must assume widespread community transmission in this central China megacity & transport hub,\u201d Lawrence Gostin, a public health expert at Georgetown University Law School in Washington, wrote in a tweet.\nWith more than 11 million people, Wuhan is central China\u2019s main industrial and commercial center, home to the country\u2019s largest inland port and gateway to its Three Gorges hydroelectric dam.\nThe latest death toll in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, rose to 17 by midday on Wednesday, state television quoted the provincial government as saying.\nHowever, the virus has already spread beyond the city to population centers including Beijing, Shanghai, Macau and Hong Kong.\nThe official China Daily newspaper said 544 cases had now been confirmed in the country.

Know what it is. The pangolin, an endangered small mammal and one of the most smuggled animals in the world, may have been the transmitter of the new coronavirus, which has killed 636 people in China. Researchers at the University of Agriculture of South China have identified the pangolin as the &quot;possible intermediate host&quot; that facilitated transmission of the virus, the university said in a statement issued on Friday, without giving further details. An animal that harbors a virus without becoming ill, but which can infect other species, is called a &quot;reservoir.&quot; In the case of the new coronavirus, most analysts point to the bat as the primary source: according to a recent study, the genomes of the new coronavirus are 96% equal to those circulating in that animal&#39;s organism. The pangolin could have served as an &quot;intermediate host&quot; between the bat and humans, according to the new study, cited by Chinese state media. The same investigation, which tested more than 1,000 samples from wild animals, concluded that the viruses detected in pangolins are 99% identical to those found in human patients. The new virus was first detected last December at a seafood and wildlife market on the outskirts of Wuhan in central China. The initial hypothesis that the intermediary was the snake was, however, rejected. During the epidemic of atypical pneumonia, also caused by a coronavirus, which between 2002 and 2003 paralyzed China, the intermediary was the civet, a small mammal whose meat is appreciated in China. As part of measures to contain the recent epidemic, China announced in late January the temporary closure of wildlife markets, indefinitely banning the breeding, transport or sale of all species of wildlife. The pangolin is the most smuggled mammal in the world, with around one million specimens captured in the last 10 years, in the forests of Asia and Africa. Illegal hunting is fueled by the increased demand for their meat and body parts. The pangolin, which has a tongue longer than its body and feeds on ants and termites, has been protected since September 2016 by the International Convention on Trade in Endangered Species, to which China is a signatory. In some regions of China and Vietnam, the use of pangolin meat is popular among young mothers for its alleged beneficial effects on breast milk, while its scales are used in traditional pharmacopoeia."}, {"content": "Fresenius expects more profit again. Despite concerns about the corona virus in China, the medical company Fresenius expects more profits again. After a difficult year in the German clinic business, for example, Fresenius wants to leave its weak phase behind. Sales in 2020 are expected to increase by up to 7 percent after adjusting for currency effects and profits by up to 5 percent, as the Dax group announced. &quot;We are firmly convinced that we will achieve earnings growth again this year,&quot; said CEO Stephan Sturm on Thursday in Bad Homburg. Last year, earnings had stagnated after adjusting for currency effects. The corona virus is now causing headwinds. Fresenius, with its Clinics, Liquid Medicines and Infusions (Kabi) divisions and its dialysis subsidiary FMC, is primarily active in Europe and the USA. But Kabi has production facilities in China that have been shut down because of the new lung disease, said Sturm. The division will feel the consequences of the corona virus in terms of volume sold. In the People&#39;s Republic, access to hospitals is restricted and supply chains are disrupted. \u201cA lot of work is done from stock,\u201d said Sturm. Many preliminary products for medicines also come from China. The longer the virus epidemic lasts, the more likely bottlenecks become. The dialysis subsidiary Fresenius Medical Care (FMNC) also declared China a growth market. There are most dialysis patients worldwide there, but only 45 percent of the Chinese with chronic kidney failure have access to treatment. Treatments in the centers continued despite the coronavirus, but there were problems selling devices for home dialysis. Because of the lung disease, many Chinese stay at home. When it comes to business outlook for the current year, Sturm also left a back door open. This does not include the possible consequences of the corona virus. It is too early to put a figure on this. Fresenius does not currently expect any significant negative financial effects. Fresenius, with a good 294,000 employees worldwide, has had a bumpy year. In the clinic business, for example, the falling number of cases, the trend towards outpatient treatment and stricter regulations had a negative impact. The group also came under price pressure in the USA for liquid drugs and infusions. Sturm had declared 2019 to be a year of transition and after two profit warnings in a row to fight with a lot of skepticism on the stock market. Fresenius shares have now climbed by more than 5 percent. Last year, group sales rose by 8 percent to 35.5 billion euros. The bottom line was that profit grew by 2 percent to 1.9 billion euros, without currency effects it stagnated. \u201cThat is not our claim,\u201d said Sturm. While the dialysis subsidiary Fresenius Medical Care grew in the fourth quarter, the results for liquid drugs, infusions and clinical nutrition fell. The hospital business, on the other hand, stabilized. Fresenius is Germany&#39;s largest hospital operator and recently bought several houses in Colombia through its Spanish clinic subsidiary Quironsalud. Entry into a third European country in the hospital business is also conceivable, stressed Sturm. Fresenius is well prepared for the future, he said. &quot;That is why we are looking ahead with confidence and are confirming our ambitious medium-term goals.&quot; The shareholders are to receive a higher dividend of EUR 0.84 per share after EUR 0.80 in the previous year.

In Spain, at the moment only one case has been confirmed. The patient, a German national, is admitted and isolated in the Hospital Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guadalupe de La Gomera. The event brings together the main companies in the mobile phone industry. The GSMA, organizer of Mobile, expects that in 2020 more than 109,000 people from almost 200 countries will attend the congress. In the last two years, the Asian presence at the congress has increased from 14% to 16%, according to a report of the event published by the GSMA in 2019. Last year, 6% of the attendees were from China. The Korean company usually presents new terminals every year at the MWC. For example, in 2019 it showed the LG G8 ThinQ, a striking mobile because it can be controlled with gestures, and the LG V50 ThinQ 5G, its first device compatible with 5G technology and also has a double screen. On this occasion the brand had planned to present devices at the congress. It also offered the possibility of closing appointments with specialists to learn about its new range of smartphones for 2020. LG had revenues of $ 53 billion in 2019, most of which came from the sale of home appliances and Home Entertainment products, such as its televisions. In the mobile market it occupies the seventh position in the world with a 3% share, according to the IHS consultancy. ZTE had a 2% share in 2018, according to data from the Counterpoint Research Market Monitor. LG&#39;s announcement comes just a few days after the GSMA assured in a statement that the fair will be held as planned: &quot;The next MWC Barcelona event will take place as planned in all venues of the Fira Gran V\u00eda and Fira Montju\u00efc, including YoMo and Four Years From Now (4YFN) &quot;. The organization further claims to be analyzing and evaluating the potential impact of the coronavirus outbreak. As explained therein, additional medical assistance will be provided in the spaces where the MWC will take place &quot;in the run-up to and during the event.&quot; The organization stresses that it is working with Fira de Barcelona to ensure &quot;sufficient disinfectant products in all places&quot;. For example, you plan to implement a cleaning and disinfection program in spaces where there is a greater likelihood of contact: from restaurant areas to services or spaces with touch screens."}, {"content": "China reports 2nd death from virus behind pneumonia outbreak. A second person has died from a new coronavirus that has caused an outbreak of pneumonia in central China, health authorities said.\nA 69-year-old man surnamed Xiong fell ill with the respiratory condition on Dec. 31, according to a statement late Thursday from the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission. He died Wednesday.\nXiong exhibited abnormal renal function, severe impairment in multiple organs, inflammation of the heart muscle and other pressing conditions when he was admitted to the hospital. It was not clear from the commission\u2019s statement whether these were preexisting issues or consequences of the viral pneumonia.\nIn total, 41 people in Wuhan have been diagnosed with a novel coronavirus, a family of viruses that can cause both the common cold and more severe diseases like SARS and MERS. As of late Thursday, 12 patients have been cured and discharged and five were being treated for acute conditions.\nXiong\u2019s is the second death associated with the outbreak. Last Saturday, a 61-year-old man who had abdominal tumors and chronic liver disease died.\nAuthorities have tracked more than 700 people who were in close contact with infected patients. Among them, no related cases have been found. However, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission has not ruled out limited human-to-human transmission, revealing a woman may have contracted the virus from her husband.\nThe Chinese government is keen to avoid a repeat of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. The SARS epidemic began in southern China in late 2002, then spread to more than two dozen countries, killing nearly 800 people.\nMost of the coronavirus patients this time either worked at or visited a particular seafood market in Wuhan. The market has since been shut down for investigation and disinfection.\nTwo patients in Thailand and another in Japan have been diagnosed with the virus.\nA 74-year-old tourist was intercepted at a Thai airport on Jan. 13 with symptoms of lung infection, the country\u2019s public health ministry said Friday. She is being treated in the same hospital, east of Bangkok, as a Chinese woman who was diagnosed with the virus after entering the country last week.\nThe Chinese woman is getting better and will soon be released, said Sukhum Kanchanapimai, Thailand\u2019s permanent secretary for public health.\nJapan\u2019s health ministry said Thursday the virus had been confirmed in a man who had been hospitalized in Japan with pneumonia symptoms after traveling to Wuhan earlier this month. His condition has improved. Kyodo News agency reported the man is Chinese."}, {"content": "Coronavirus: WHO is doing its job; stop attacking its chief for praising China | Opinion. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has been at the forefront in fighting this health crisis under the leadership of its Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Since December 31, 2019, when WHO was first informed about pneumonia cases in Wuhan emanating from \"unknown causes\", the WHO has been actively monitoring the situation and holding consultations at different levels.\nThese include declaring the outbreak an international health emergency, mobilising the international scientific community to come together to fight coronavirus, and issuing safety precautions and guidelines for general public, businesses, governments, hospitals and other stakeholders, among other measures.\nAs WHO chief, Dr Ghebreyesus flew in to China to meet President Xi Jinping, and a WHO team comprising of international health experts is already operating in China. Dr Ghebreyesus has also been interacting with world leaders, spearheading calls for research collaborations and raising funds to tackle the coronavirus outbreak.\nBut these efforts by the WHO in the face of a global health emergency, about which very little is known, seem to be of little consideration for a section of society that has unleashed a brutal attack against Dr Ghebreyesus on social media.\nThe attack is not only personal in nature, but also seeks to tarnish his professional image by questioning his credentials and commitment.\n'CHINA'S LAP DOG'\nDr Ghebreyesus has been accused of conspiring with China in its \"propaganda\" to hush-up coronavirus cases. Many have gone on to call him \"China's lap dog\", say he is \"irresponsible and coward\", and accuse him of \"jeopardising the world for his private profit\", among other charges.\nThe WHO chief's recent meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping and his tweets praising the country's leadership for its \"determination to end the new coronavirus outbreak\" too have not gone down well with many social media users.\nThe petition blames Dr Ghebreyesus for the rising coronavirus cases and resultant deaths, and says this is partly because of his underestimation of the outbreak.\n\"We strongly think he is not fit for his role as WHO Director General. We call for the immediate resignation of Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. A lot of us are really disappointed. We believe WHO is supposed to be politically neutral,\" the petition reads. Its comment section, where people mention why they are signing the petition, is filled with derogatory remarks that are unmentionable.\nIn short, Dr Ghebreyesus is being hounded online on two counts:\nMISPLACED ANGER\nPeople's concerns and anxiety about the coronavirus outbreak are understandable but that cannot be an excuse to malign the WHO or its chief. In times of an epidemic of this magnitude, people, irrespective of national boundaries and political leanings, need to stand united and support individuals and organisations that are working on ground to tackle the crisis.\nHurling personal attacks on individuals leading such efforts doesn't help improve the situation, but rather often proves to be counterproductive. It infuses negativity in public discourse, which in turn tends to cast aspersions on genuine efforts--a breeding ground for suspicion and misinformation.\nSecondly, one may have a hundred differences with China and what its political system and leadership stands for. But is this really the time to attack and malign the nation?\nBefore attacking Dr Ghebreyesus for meeting President Xi Jinping and praising his government's efforts against coronavirus, one must realise that besides leading an international health organisation in the midst of an epidemic, Dr Ghebreyesus also has to negotiate various diplomatic hurdles in forging an international coalition against the epidemic. With regards to coronavirus, this global effort is simply impossible if China is not on board.\nFaced with such a sensitive situation, the WHO chief cannot afford to upset the Chinese leadership, even if there are some shortcomings on ground. A confrontational approach against President Xi Jinping is likely to snowball and prove futile when it comes to controlling the situation.\nThose who are calling Dr Ghebreyesus names and demanding his resignation must answer if they think China would have allowed a WHO team comprising international health experts to visit coronavirus-hit regions and investigate the situation had the health body's chief confronted President Xi and talked bitter about him.\nThe reality today is that thousands of people are suffering in China. Many have died and many more are likely to die in the coming days. Priority for the global community right now should be to control the situation, not to embroil itself in mudslinging and waste its energy by pointing fingers in a show of one-upmanship. Investigations into who and what went wrong (if at all) can wait. Saving lives can't.\nDr Ghebreyesus's success in convincing China to allow a team of international health experts to visit coronavirus-affected regions is nothing short of a major diplomatic success. If at all China deliberately hid facts or underreported the situation, as is alleged, it will be known to the world in due course when these international experts document their observations.\nWhy do we have to jump into conclusions without any evidence and tarnish the image of hardworking health workers who have been slogging day in out treating patients? Those leading the vitriol online attack against the WHO and its chief must answer if slander, malice and a hatred-filled anti-China campaign is how these tireless medicos deserve to be treated with for their services.\nThe other reason why the WHO and Dr Ghebreyesus are being attacked stems from the argument that Dr Ghebreyesus didn't declare coronavirus outbreak an international health emergency at an earlier date.\nThose forwarding this argument must understand that decisions to declare an international emergency cannot be based on one person's whims and fancies. Far from being a one-person show, it involves rigorous assessments and deliberations between various stakeholders, all of which takes time. Even before declaring it an international health emergency, the WHO had been rigorously following up on research and treatment of coronavirus patients in China.\nHowever, none of this means China, the WHO or Dr Ghebreyesus are above questioning. One must question them by all means, but personal attacks and a campaign aimed at tarnishing individuals and maligning an entire country is definitely not the way to do so."}, {"content": "PSI20 and European exchanges suffer from fears of contagion from the Chinese virus.

Taiwan has called China \"vile\" for not allowing it real time information about the virus from the WHO.

So this is epidemic fighting with Chinese characteristics.

The island has long claimed China is intentionally using fake news to undermine its democracy and people's faith in the government. China has previously denied the accusations.  \n Adding to the tensions, China has in recent weeks been flying fighter jets and bombers close to the island. Taiwan's Defence Ministry reported another case on Friday.  \n While Taiwan moved early to suspend travel links with China to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, and has reported far fewer cases than China, its number of patients has continued to grow.  \n On Saturday, Taiwan reported five new cases of infection, including four people who had contact with another infected patient in a hospital and one person returning from a trip to Egypt and Dubai, bringing Taiwan's total to 39.  \n Taiwan has reported one death from the coronavirus, while nine patients have recovered and been released from hospital.  \n China, where the outbreak began, has reported more than 79,000 infections and over 2,800 deaths.

The Directorate-General for Health is still evaluating when the analysis can be repeated. The 20 citizens are distributed by the Hospital Pulido Valente and the Parque Sa\u00fade (four returnees are in these facilities), in Lisbon, and were visited this Monday afternoon by the International Health team, coordinated by the Directorate-General for Health (DGS ). \u201cRight now there are no clinical elements to point out. Last night&#39;s atmosphere was one of tranquility after a long journey. From the point of view of the general condition, they are all fine. We are also ensuring that comfort aspects are improved. We know that the facilities are not hotels. There are aspects that are being completed, such as some support material such as books, newspapers and the Internet\u201d, said the Minister of Health, at a press conference that took place this Monday. Health director-general Gra\u00e7a Freitas complemented the clinical information: \u201cNone of the people developed symptoms related to the new disease. There was no fever, cough or respiratory symptoms.\u201d The 20 citizens can socialize as long as they wear masks and comply with the recommendations given by health professionals. For now, the analyzes carried out on Sunday at the end of the night and whose results were known this Monday gave a negative result for the presence of the new coronavirus. But they can be repeated, although the moment when this could happen is still under analysis. The first action, said the responsible, will be the observation of symptoms. \u201cThe appearance of symptoms will make repeat analyses. All countries are learning from this new methodology. The virus was detected less than a month ago. There are some doubts. There are countries that are carrying out tests at 48 hours and at 72 hours, some only with the presence of symptoms and others when the quarantine is ending. Almost every day, we analyze the different hypotheses and make a decision based on what seems best to us and what the other partner countries are doing\u201d, she explained. Gra\u00e7a Freitas also stated that the DGS is counting on the collaboration of a group of experts and that it will be based on the recommendation of this group that they will also take a decision on the moment to repeat the analyses. \u201cWe haven&#39;t made a decision yet. Tomorrow [Tuesday] we will talk to the experts again and, according to the experts, we will decide the frequency of the analyses.\u201d If one of these people presents any suspicious symptoms, the protocol that already exists will be activated. The professional contacts the medical helpline to validate the case as a suspect, material will be collected for analysis and the person will be referred to the referral hospital. In a positive case, if there was close contact with another of the returnees without wearing a mask, it will be necessary to restart the quarantine cycle. Asked again about the issue of isolation and measures to apply to other citizens who come from China, Marta Temido recalled that the legislation allows, in exceptional situations that do not occur, to dictate the separation of people in order to ensure the health of themselves and third parties . \u201cThese are exceptional measures that always depend on some weighting, proportionality criteria and legislation. This eventuality doesn&#39;t happen, but we know that there are mechanisms that we have and we will use if necessary to guarantee that they are in security situations, as well as the general community\u201d, explained the minister. Gra\u00e7a Freitas reiterated that this group of citizens is special for having been at the epicenter of a new disease for at least 30 days and that for this reason they were treated with special measures. \u201cThese citizens are not like others who might come from China. That&#39;s why the Ministry of Health decided to treat them in a special way. Others who arrive at similar risk will have similar treatment. For different risk, different treatment\u201d, stressed the Director-General of Health. Portugal currently has three referral hospitals for suspected cases of infection by the new coronavirus and two specialized ambulances for the transport of these cases. The delay in the transfer of a suspected case in Felgueiras to Hospital de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o led the Union of Emergency Pre-Hospital Technicians to make several criticisms about the material made available in the ambulances, means available in other parts of the country and available information. Gra\u00e7a Freitas explained that in this first phase, which level is to contain the disease, it is necessary to have a &quot;very restricted line of first-line service, with a very well-prepared laboratory and a number of highly capable professionals.&quot; At this time, she said they are working with the National Institute of Health Dr. Ricardo Jorge (Insa) and with the Regional Health administrations, already thinking about a second line of response with more laboratories, transport network and other hospitals involved. She subscribes to newsletters for free and receive the best of current affairs and the most in-depth works from P\u00fablico. Asked what the protocol at this time should a suspected case appear, for example in the Azores or Madeira, the responsible said that the patient will be at departure in a hospital in the autonomous region and if there is no laboratory capacity in the area, it will be the biological sample to be sent to Lisbon to carry out the tests in the reference laboratory. The president of Insa Fernando Almeida highlighted that the institute works in a network with 20 other national laboratories, including on the islands, and that all have the necessary technology to carry out the tests. Marta Temido added that an assessment is underway of what happened with the two suspected cases that Portugal has already registered, one in Lisbon and the other in Porto. &quot;We already have the collection of the entire timeline and we will do a detailed internal analysis to see what went wrong and assess measures to be taken.&quot; The minister added that this Monday she spoke with the president of INEM about the need to reformulate the information and material available to all partners who work with that entity.

US owe us an explanation,\" tweeted Zhao, who is known for his provocative statements on social media.\nPompeo himself has sought to link China to the global pandemic, repeatedly referring to the \"Wuhan virus\" despite advice from health professionals that such geographic labels can be stigmatizing.\nYang issued a \"stern warning to the US that any scheme to smear China will be doomed to fail\", Xinhua said in its summary of the call with Pompeo.\nThe key Chinese foreign policy leader \"noted that some US politicians have frequently slandered China and its anti-epidemic efforts and stigmatized the country, which has enraged the Chinese people\", Xinhua said.\nYang called on the US side to \"correct its wrongful behaviour\".\nTrump is under fire over his handling of the pandemic, and his backers have sought to cast the coronavirus as a disease brought by foreigners.\nWhile COVID-19 has largely come under control in China, it has killed more than 7,000 people around the world and severely disrupted daily life in Western countries."}, {"content": "why are malaria pills being used against coronavirus?. Older malaria drugs are being studied, and in some cases used, to treat or try to prevent infection with the new coronavirus, even though there is no firm evidence to show they are effective.  \n Studies are underway in a number of countries, including China, France and the United States, to see whether the pills - chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine - may have a role to play in the rapidly spreading pandemic.  \n U.S. President Donald Trump has touted the malaria drugs as \"a game changer.\" But the Food and Drug Administration and other health experts said trials must first ensure the medicines are effective and safe for use in this patient population.  \n  \n WHY ARE MALARIA DRUGS UNDER CONSIDERATION? There are currently no vaccines or U.S.-approved treatments for the highly contagious COVID-19 respiratory illness that has killed more than 18,000 worldwide, so even the most severely ill patients largely receive only supportive care such as breathing assistance.  \n On its website, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says some U.S. clinicians have reported anecdotal use of hydroxychloroquine at different doses.  \n Chloroquine is a synthetic form of quinine, which is found on the bark of the cinchona plant. It has been used for hundreds of years in South America to treat fever.  \n Chloroquine was first synthesized in the 1930s. A version called hydroxychloroquine, in use since the 1950s, is considered to be less toxic, according to studies. Both drugs can cause serious side effects, including vision loss, heart problems or even death, if used incorrectly.  \n The drugs are used to combat malaria, which is caused by a parasite spread through mosquito bites, because they interrupt its ability to digest a host's blood cells.  \n Scientists have detailed biochemical proprieties of chloroquine that indicate it could be used against some viral infections. These include direct antiviral effects, such as blocking steps needed by certain viruses to replicate, and its ability to suppress production and release of proteins involved in inflammatory complications of several viral diseases.  \n In addition to malaria, hydroxychloroquine is also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.  \n  \n WHAT DOES THE DATA SAY?  \n Data has begun to emerge from some coronavirus trials, but most information so far is preliminary.  \n A French team last week said initial results from a 24-patient trial of hydroxychloroquine showed that 25% of patients given the drug still carried the coronavirus after six days, compared with 90% of patients given a placebo. But the trial is small and results on patient outcomes are still awaited.  \n Chinese researchers last month reported trial results showing that chloroquine treatment of COVID-19 patients had clinical and virologic benefit versus a comparison group.  \n It has been added as a recommended treatment for the illness in China, where the virus first emerged in December.  \n This week, the Journal of Zhejiang University reported disappointing results from a 30-patient Shanghai study of hydroxychloroquine. It showed the drug worked no better than standard care for patients with COVID-19.  \n The University of Minnesota has launched a 1,500-person trial to see whether hydroxychloroquine can prevent or reduce the severity of COVID-19 in people exposed to the virus - including healthcare workers and family members of infected people.  \n Other trials of the malaria drugs are ongoing or set to start in the United Kingdom, Norway and Thailand.  \n New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, whose state is the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak with more than 25,000 cases, on Sunday said it had acquired hundreds of thousands of doses of the malaria drugs to use in a clinical trial.  \n  \n IS THERE ENOUGH TO GO AROUND?  \n In the United States, prescriptions for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have already spiked and are in short supply, according to pharmacists.  \n Several makers of the generic medicines said they are increasing production of chloroquine pills. Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd <TEVA.TA>, Mylan NV <MYL.O> and Bayer AG <BAYGn.DE> have donated large quantities of the drugs to health authorities.  \n  \n PRESCRIPTION ONLY!  \n Health officials caution that no one should be taking these drugs to treat or prevent coronavirus infection without medical supervision and a prescription.  \n In Arizona, a man died and his wife was hospitalized after taking a nonmedical form of chloroquine used to fight parasites in aquariums. \"Given the uncertainty around COVID-19, we understand that people are trying to find new ways to prevent or treat this virus, but self-medicating is not the way to do so,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Brooks, medical director of the poison and drug information center at Arizona-based Banner Health.

In response, the US summoned China\u2019s Washington ambassador Cui Tiankai this week to complain about the tweet. \n In posts on the social media platform, which is banned in China, Zhao also shared articles from the Canadian conspiracy site Global Research that suggested Covid-19 had originated in the US. \n At Wednesday\u2019s media conference, Mr Trump demurred when asked about a CBS reporter\u2019s Twitter post on Tuesday that a White House official had referred to the virus as \u201cKung Flu\u201d during a private conversation. \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d he said when asked if the term put Asian-Americans at risk. \u201cThey probably would agree with it 100 per cent, it comes from China.\u201d \n Mr Trump also said he had no plans to ease tariffs on China, amid calls for him to do so by American industry groups. \u201cChina is paying us billions and billions of dollars in tariffs, and there's no reason to do that.

In recent weeks, with the outbreak easing across the mainland, senior diplomatic officials have parroted the theory that the virus did not originate in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, as has been widely presumed by scientists. \n Beijing also provoked anger in Washington on Tuesday when it moved to expel at least 13 American journalists from China by revoking their visas in retaliation for Washington\u2019s move last month to curb the number of journalist visas it issued to staff from five Chinese state-owned media outlets. \n The Chinese action affects journalists from\u00a0The New York Times,\u00a0The Washington Post\u00a0and\u00a0The Wall Street Journal. \n Asked for reaction to the journalists\u2019 impending expulsion, Mr Trump \u2014\u00a0who frequently disparages \u201cfake news\u201d outlets he does not like \u2014\u00a0said: \u201cI am not happy to see it.

MELBOURNE (BLOOMBERG) - The new coronavirus might have infected at least 500,000 people in Wuhan, the Chinese city at the epicentre of the global outbreak, by the time it peaks in coming weeks. \n The typically bustling megacity, where the so-called 2019-nCoV virus emerged late last year, has been in effective lockdown since Jan 23, restricting the movement of 11 million people. Recent trends in reported cases in Wuhan broadly support the preliminary mathematical modelling the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine is using to predict the epidemic's transmission dynamics. \n \"Assuming current trends continue, we're still projecting a mid-to-late-February peak\" of virus cases in Wuhan, Adam Kucharski, an associate professor of infectious disease epidemiology, said by email Sunday (Feb 9). \"There's a lot of uncertainty, so I'm cautious about picking out a single value for the peak, but it's possible based on current data we might see a peak prevalence over 5 per cent.\" \n That would potentially mean at least 1 in 20 people would have been infected in the city by the time the epidemic peaks, Kucharski said, adding that this may change if transmission patterns slow in coming days. The prediction doesn't indicate a coming surge in cases in Wuhan, but that the current cumulative total doesn't reflect all infections, especially mild ones, that have occurred. \n Health authorities in China and around the world are anxiously waiting to know whether the world's largest known quarantine effort has been effective in containing the pneumonia-causing virus in Wuhan and across other cities in Hubei province, a landlocked region of 60 million people. \n Kucharski, whose research focuses on the dynamics of infectious diseases, and colleagues have based their modelling on a range of assumptions about the 2019-nCoV virus. These include an incubation period of 5.2 days, a delay from the onset of symptoms to confirmation of infection of 6.1 days, and about 10 million people being at risk of infection in Wuhan. \n Based on that, a prevalence of 5 per cent equates to about 500,000 cumulative infections. That's many times more than the 16,902 cases provincial health authorities had counted in Wuhan as of midnight Sunday. \n Researchers will gauge the proportion of people in the population who have been infected with 2019-nCoV after a test becomes available that enables them to conduct a so-called serosurvey to identify those whose blood contains antibodies produced in response to exposure to the virus. \n Currently, the true number of people in Wuhan exposed to the virus \"may be vastly underestimated,\" Manuel Battegay and colleagues at the University of Basel in Switzerland said in a study published Friday. \"With a focus on thousands of serious cases, mild or asymptomatic courses that possibly account for the bulk of the 2019-nCoV infections might remain largely unrecognised, in particular during the influenza season.\" \n Authorities in China have counted more than 37,000 cases - of which more than 800 have been fatal - over the past two months. That has surpassed the 774 fatalities from the 2002-2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, over eight months, according to the World Health Organisation. \n In the first 17,000 or so cases, about 82 per cent are mild, 15 per cent severe and 3 per cent critical, the WHO said Friday. Of 138 patients admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in the first four weeks of January, 26 per cent were placed in intensive care and 4.3 per cent died, a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association published Friday found. \n While the fast-moving, infectious coronavirus has caused thousands of people to fall gravely ill and overwhelm hospitals, once researchers understand the full spectrum of illness associated with the virus, the overall case-fatality risk is likely to be much less than 1 per cent, said Ian Lipkin, director of the Centre for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health in New York. \n People with mild or no apparent symptoms aren't currently being counted among cases, he told reporters Sunday. A slowdown in the increase in reported cases over the past few days is \"meaningful,\" according to Lipkin, who recently returned to the U.S. from China, where he was advising on the outbreak. He spoke with journalists during a 14-day home quarantine. \n If measures taken so far to contain the outbreak are effective, some \"dramatic reductions\" in infections should be observed in the third or fourth weeks of February, he said. Warmer, early-spring weather might also impede transmission, he said. \n Some studies indicate an infected person may not display symptoms for 14 days or more, with testing and confirmation of cases adding to delays. This will prolong the time it will take to identify whether China's unprecedented disease-control measures have worked. \n \"The next two weeks are really critical to understand what's been happening,\" said Benjamin Cowling, head of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Hong Kong, in an interview in Melbourne on Thursday. \"And, is this going to spread into other locations, or have we avoided what could be a global pandemic because of the control measures that have been implemented to date?\" The number of cases reported in Wuhan and across Hubei province has been tracking downward over the past several days. \n \"There has been a stabilisation in the number of cases reported from Hubei, and we're in a four-day stable period where the number of reported cases hasn't advanced,\" Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, told reporters in Geneva Saturday. \"That's good news and may reflect the impact of the control measures that have been put in place.\" There has been a \"low, but steady incidence\" of infections in places outside Hubei, Ryan said. It's unclear which of those provinces may control the disease or where it might escalate, he said. \n \"We hope that the same stabilisation that appears to be occurring in Wuhan also occurs outside,\" Ryan said. \"But, again it's very, very, very early to make any predictions about numbers.\" \"This is still a very intense disease outbreak in Wuhan and Hubei, and there are still great risks in practically all of the other provinces, so we will wait and see,\" he said."}, {"content": "Minister of Agriculture deplores misinterpretation of his statements about coronaviruses. The Minister of Agriculture, Maria do C\u00e9u Albuquerque, regretted this Saturday that her statements about the new coronavirus detected in China were misinterpreted, guaranteeing that she did not want to take advantage of a &quot;worldwide scourge&quot;. Speaking to journalists at the end of a visit to the Pastor and Cheese Fair of Penalva do Castelo, Maria do C\u00e9u Albuquerque explained that she meant that Asian markets &quot;are very demanding from the point of view of food safety&quot;, but Portuguese products , &quot;because of their high quality and the standards they have to comply with, they are currently in the global market and also already in the Asian market&quot;. &quot;Our exports are clearly a distinguishing factor of agriculture within the Portuguese economy. Data from the INE [National Statistics Institute] published yesterday [Friday] show that, of the 6.9 billion euros of exports, we have moved to 7.1 billion euros&quot;, he stressed. On Wednesday, in Berlin, on a visit to Portuguese companies participating in Fruit Log\u00edstica, the minister said she believed that the new coronavirus, which has already caused more than 700 deaths in China, &quot;may even have very positive consequences&quot; for Portuguese exports agri-food sector to Asian markets. Today, the official recalled that she accompanied Portugal Fresh, &quot;which has been running that fair for ten years&quot; and that it began &quot;with the export volume of 700 million euros and is currently doubled, 1,600 million euros in exports&quot;. &quot;This is what is important to value. I deeply regret that this message did not pass, because far from me wanting to take advantage of what is a global scourge that inevitably affects the world economy and the lives of all citizens, regardless of from the point of the world where they are&quot;, he stressed. Maria do C\u00e9u Albuquerque guaranteed that the sector will continue to work to demonstrate the confidence that third countries can have in Portuguese products. &quot;This is a work that does not start now, that is not reinforced in this situation of global crisis. It is a work of continuity that we all have to do in relation to this matter&quot;, she said. According to the official, it is known that &quot;Asia and Oceania will need to buy more products from markets other than their own&quot;.

Fears of a U.S.-Iran war gave way to the coronavirus pandemic which JPMorgan reckons will have pushed the world economy into a 12% contraction over January to March. The quarter saw the most brutal global equity collapse since the Great Depression, exacerbated by a 60% oil price slump.  \n April may not bring much relief, with coronavirus still spreading rapidly and keeping large parts of the global economy shuttered. Banks have rushed to slash Q2 forecasts too, so expect more turbulence on financial markets.  \n The cavalry has arrived though. G20 governments have promised a $5 trillion revival effort, major central banks have slashed rates and restarted asset purchases. Markets have bounced big and may actually end Q1 on a high. What we need now is to see infection rates peaking and that will show whether April falls, or if it's indeed time for spring.  \n  \n (Graphic: World stocks vs. COVID-19 confirmed cases, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/4023/3979/msci.png)  \n  \n 2/PANDEMIC PAYROLLS:  \n Through years of stubbornly low economic growth and inflation, the brightest spot was the U.S. labour market, with unemployment reaching half-century lows. Coronavirus may have ended that boom.  \n With infections surging, cities in lockdown, businesses downing shutters and most travel on ice, staff layoffs are likely to mushroom. That showed up in the number of Americans filing unemployment benefit claims which hit a record of more than 3 million. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would rise to 1 million, though some estimates were as high as 4 million.  \n Now the wait is on for Friday's non-farm payrolls figures that will offer a snapshot of the jobs picture over March. The government's unprecedented $2 trillion fiscal expansion package includes a $500 billion fund to help hard-hit industries and a comparable amount to fund direct payments of up to $3,000 apiece to U.S. families.  \n Economists expect the payroll data to show a loss of 293,000 jobs - the largest monthly drop since July 2009. A significant overshoot of that and the $2 trillion stimulus approved by Congress could suddenly start to look inadequate.  \n  \n (Graphic: Pandemic payrolls, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3945/3901/Pasted%20Image.jpg)  \n  \n 3/CHINA'S PYRRHIC VICTORY  \n The world's factory is re-opening, but the market is closed and the shoppers are gone.  \n China's social isolation policies appear to have contained the coronavirus at home, allowing work and travel to resume. But major economic damage may be yet to come. With infections climbing exponentially in the United States, Europe and the other markets China exports to, and with supply chains in disarray, China is getting neither the imported components it needs nor demand for its products.  \n Already Chinese factories' Jan-Feb profits have hit their lowest in a decade and upcoming manufacturing surveys will very likely reveal more pain. And just like everywhere else, job losses are mounting up, regardless of how many cheap loans are being offered to businesses. Expectations are now for the economy to contract this quarter but many economists reckon 2020 growth will be around 2% - a third of the \"around 6%\" authorities target.  \n  \n (Graphic: China's Industrial profits shrinking, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/9258/9170/Pasted%20Image.jpg)  \n  \n 4/COME TOGETHER, RIGHT NOW  \n The European Central Bank has done its bit to tackle the virus damage, having massively expanded asset purchases, agreed to more flexibility on the share of bonds it buys from each country and buffered borrowing costs for weaker euro zone states such as Italy. Now it's up to European Union leaders to come together.  \n So far there is no united front: they've failed to agree on the scale of support for\u00a0economies ravaged by the outbreak. The ECB's aggressive action gives them some breathing space but, as of now, politicians are wrangling over setting up a credit line worth some 2% of annual output from the euro area bailout fund.  \n Many European governments urge the issuance of a joint debt instrument to face a crisis which Goldman Sachs economists estimate may shrink the euro economy by 9% this year. But Germany and some others oppose that. At stake, says France's Emmanuel Macron, is the survival of the European project.

But few have felt the pain as much as frontier markets, a subset of smaller and often riskier emerging economies.  \n Many of those frontier economies are in Africa, and are suffering from a toxic combination of tumbling oil and commodity prices, the prospect of the global economy tumbling into recession and weakening currencies which will make servicing external debt ever-more expensive.  \n Oil-producing countries like Angola, Ghana, Gabon and Nigeria have seen their dollar-denominated debt drop sharply, with yields of some issues shooting above 20%, indicating soaring borrowing costs. Many countries on the continent lack the financial firepower or foreign currency reserves needed to combat the coronavirus and prop up their economies, with healthcare systems already under strain.  \n The World Bank and International Monetary Fund on Wednesday urged official bilateral creditors to provide immediate debt relief to the world's poorest countries as they grapple with the human and economic consequences of the pandemic.  \n Leaders of the Group of 20 major economies pledged on Thursday to inject over $5 trillion into the global economy to limit job and income losses from the coronavirus and \"do whatever it takes to overcome the pandemic\", expressing concern about Africa in particular.

HAKONE - A Japanese confectionery shop in the popular hot spring town of Hakone has incurred the wrath of the Chinese for putting up a sign containing offensive content to ban Chinese tourists amid a global virus outbreak originating from China. \n The owner of the shop in an onsen resort in the popular Yumoto district in the Kanagawa prefecture told reporters he had put up the sign last week on Jan 17, one day after Japan announced its first case of infection of the novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, in Kanagawa. \n \"Ill-mannered Chinese tourists have caused trouble in my store,\" the man, who was not identified, was quoted as saying by the Asahi Shimbun news site. \n \"I want to protect myself against the coronavirus.

The ban, however, will stay. \n On the Chinese Twitter-like platform Weibo, netizens are calling for a boycott of the store. \n \"Although the translated text doesn't make sense, one can feel the strong malice,\" said one Weibo user Dong Dong Dong Ying Jiang who also posted a photo of the shop. \"Remember this trash shop and never go there.\" \n Some users however also pointed out that some shops in China also carry signs that say no entry for the Japanese and dogs. \n The 2019-nCoV virus emerged in central China's city of Wuhan in December last year and has since infected over 400 people and killed nine in mainland China alone, according to official figures released on Wednesday\u00a0morning (Jan 22).

In late January, South Korean health officials summoned representatives from more than 20 medical companies from their Lunar New Year celebrations to a conference room tucked inside Seoul's busy train station.\nOne of the country's top infectious disease officials delivered an urgent message: South Korea needed an effective test immediately to detect the novel coronavirus, then running rampant in China. He promised the companies swift regulatory approval.\nThough there were only four known cases in South Korea at that point, \"we were very nervous. We believed that it could develop into a pandemic,\" one attendee, Lee Sang-won, an infectious diseases expert at the Korea Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, told Reuters.\n\"We acted like an army,\" he said.\nA week after the January 27 meeting, South Korea's CDC approved one company's diagnostic test. Another company soon followed. By the end of February, South Korea was making headlines around the world for its drive-through screening centres and ability to test thousands of people daily.\nSouth Korea's swift action stands in stark contrast to what has transpired in the United States. Seven weeks after the train station meeting, the Koreans have tested well over 290,000 people and identified over 8,000 infections.\nNew cases are falling off: Ninety-three were reported Wednesday, down from a daily peak of 909 two weeks earlier.\nThe United States, whose first case was detected the same day as South Korea's, is not even close to meeting demand for testing. About 60,000 tests have been run by public and private labs in a country of 330 million, federal officials said Tuesday.\nAs a result, US officials don't fully grasp how many Americans have been infected and where they are concentrated - crucial to containment efforts. While more than 7,000 US cases had been identified as of Wednesday, as many as 96 million people could be infected in coming months, and 480,000 could die, according to a projection prepared for the American Hospital Association by Dr James Lawler, an infectious disease expert at the University of Nebraska Medical Centre.\nThe delayed and chaotic testing in the United States will cost lives, potentially including those of doctors and nurses, many medical experts predict. Already more than 100 people have died overall, and fears of rampant spread have led to extraordinary restrictions on social interaction, upending the US economy, schools, hospitals and everyday life.\n\"It makes me feel like I'm living in a farce,\" said Dr Ritu Thamman, a cardiologist and clinical assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. Even hospital staff who may have been exposed can't get a test, she said. \"We are a rich country but we don't have these kinds of things?\"\nThe administration of President Donald Trump was tripped up by government rules and conventions, former officials and public health experts say. Instead of drafting the private sector early on to develop tests, as South Korea did, US health officials relied, as is customary, on test kits prepared by the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, some of which proved faulty.\nThen, sticking to its time-consuming vetting procedures, the US Food and Drug Administration didn't approve tests other than the CDC's until February 29, more than five weeks after discussions with outside labs had begun.\nMeanwhile, in the absence of enough kits, the CDC insisted for weeks on narrow criteria for testing, recommending it only when a person had recently been to China or other hot spots or had contact with someone known to be infected. As a result, the federal government failed to screen an untold number of Americans and missed opportunities to contain the spread, clinicians and public health experts say.\nSouth Korea took a risk, releasing briskly vetted tests, then circling back later to spot check their effectiveness. By contrast, the United States' FDA said it wanted to ensure, upfront, that the tests were accurate before they went out to millions of Americans.\n\"There are always opportunities to learn from situations like this one,\" FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, who has been on the job only three months, told Reuters. \"But one thing I will stand firm on: We cannot compromise on the quality of the tests because what would be worse than no tests at all is wildly inaccurate test results.\"\nIn a statement, CDC spokesman Benjamin Haynes said, \"This process has not gone as smoothly as we would have liked.\" But he said \"more and more state labs have come online, increasing our public health system's ability to detect and respond to cases.\"\nBombarded by criticism amid a re-election campaign, Trump vowed on Friday to ramp up production of test kits in partnership with private companies and to make the diagnostic tests more widely available at hospitals and in-store parking lots. This week, the FDA said more than 35 universities, hospitals and lab companies had begun running their own tests, under the agency's revised policy.\nBut it may be weeks before enough tests are on hand to fill the need.\n\"The idea of anybody getting (tested) easily the way people in other countries are doing it, we're not set up for that,\" Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told a House committee last week. \"That is a failing. Let's admit it.\"\nIt's a problem many Americans, accustomed to hearing they have the most advanced medical care in the world, find hard to fathom.\n\"I don't know how we messed this up so badly,\" said Ruth Blodgett, 65, whose husband of the same age couldn't get a coronavirus test on Saturday in an urgent care clinic outside Rochester, New York, even though he was coughing and the doctor ordered one for him. \"We got caught flat-footed. For America, that's unacceptable.\"\n'HURRY UP AND DEVELOP THE KITS'\nAt the pivotal January 27 meeting at the Seoul train station, South Korean government leaders told companies they were cleared for take-off.\n\"They were told that the 'emergency use authorization' would be coming, so hurry up and develop the kits,\" said Lee Hyukmin, head of the coronavirus task force at the Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine, who was at the meeting.\nOne of the companies was Kogene Biotech Co Ltd, whose test kit was the only one to work initially. The government announced its approval on February 4.\n\"The government acted quickly,\" said Myoah Baek, an executive director at Kogene. The Korean CDC \"disclosed information on test methods so test kit makers were able to speed up development.\"\nLee Hyukmin of the Korean laboratory society said the government was swift - but not reckless.\nSouth Korea's rapid response to the new coronavirus resulted from scars of the past.\nIn the aftermath of the 2015 outbreak of MERS, short for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, critics slammed then-President Park Geun-hye and her administration for a slow response and a lack of transparency. Public confidence waned in Park, who was impeached in 2017 following an unrelated corruption scandal.\nThe country had 186 MERS cases, more than anywhere outside the Middle East, including 38 deaths.\n\"We can't ever forget the incident. It is engraved in our mind,\" the Korean CDC's Lee Sang-won said. \"We were hurt so much, and we felt remorseful.\"\n'A REAL FOUL UP'\nOn January 31, only days after the Seoul train station meeting, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) declared the novel coronavirus a public health emergency, citing a similar pronouncement from the World Health Organization.\nHHS oversees the separate operations of the FDA and CDC, key agencies involved in responding to the pandemic. The CDC was responsible for developing the initial test kits for the virus. Then, under longstanding protocols, the FDA needed to approve the test before it could be sent to state and local labs around the country. Private labs and large hospitals could develop their own tests or work off the CDC version.\nOn February 3, amid the preparations to address the emergency, the FDA hosted an all-day conference at its headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, which had been scheduled well before the outbreak. Regulators, researchers and industry representatives gathered to discuss the general process for putting diagnostic tests cleared under emergencies on the path to permanent approval by the FDA.\nThough coronavirus was now the hottest topic in global medicine, a broadcast of the meeting conveyed little sense of urgency about the epidemic sweeping the globe. It was mentioned in passing but regulators mostly stuck to their Powerpoint presentations.\nIn his remarks, Dr Timothy Stenzel, who oversees the FDA's review of diagnostic tests, spoke broadly about the agency's mission to protect public health: \"It's our goal to be first in the world wherever possible to authorize new tests.\"\nCarolyn Hiller, a program director at the Medical Device Innovation Consortium, which hosted the event alongside FDA, said there were discussions with the agency about postponing the meeting because of the coronavirus outbreak, but both sides opted to go ahead.\n\"The whole coronavirus thing blew up in real time while this was happening,\" she said.\nStenzel did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement, the FDA acknowledged that the coronavirus was not a \"specific topic on the agenda.\" But it said the agency already was talking to test developers and \"the conference was timely and addressed issues important\" to firms and institutions looking to produce a test.\nThe following day, February 4, the FDA greenlighted a CDC test kit for the virus.\nWeeks of chaos would follow.\nBy February 8, some states and other public labs were complaining that the CDC's test wasn't working because of a flawed component that gave inconclusive results. Three days later, the CDC told the labs that it was manufacturing a new component.\nAs of mid-February, the federal government remained stuck in first gear. The CDC was the primary supplier of tests across much of the country, and other labs couldn't immediately deploy their own without the FDA's blessing.\nHHS said it has assigned a team of outside scientists to examine what went wrong with the CDC's initial batch of tests, such as whether there was a manufacturing defect, flawed design or contamination in the agency's lab. The precise problem has not been identified.\nThe CDC didn't send out new test kits until late February. Meanwhile, public health experts say, a crucial window was closing on containing the virus, which by then was known to have infected more than 60 people.\nThe US emergency declaration issued in late January created additional hurdles that hindered a wider expansion in testing, according to former federal officials and lab professionals.\nThe declaration eased the way for drugmakers to pursue vaccines and antiviral treatments for Covid-19. But public health experts said that the same declaration made it harder to expand diagnostic testing outside the CDC.\nThat's because the declaration required diagnostic tests developed by individual labs, such as those at hospitals or universities, to undergo greater scrutiny than in non-emergencies - presumably because the stakes are higher.\n\"Paradoxically, it increased regulations on diagnostics while it created an easier pathway for vaccines and antivirals,\" said Dr Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Centre for Health Security. \"There was a real foul-up with diagnostic tests that has exposed a flaw in the United States' pandemic response plan.\"\nDr William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, said the CDC and FDA stuck to their conventional playbook for too long.\n\"Traditional public health thinking is, 'Don't create widespread panic and don't go over the top. Keep the testing narrow in a precision rifle approach rather than a mass, shotgun approach,'\" Schaffner said. \"That failed in this instance. This virus acted differently and it overwhelmed the US system. South Korea had a much better sense of what was happening.\"\nIn a statement Tuesday, the CDC said: \"After finding out that some labs could not fully verify the test, CDC began working on a solution and identifying the source of the problem . CDC, in conjunction with FDA, determined how to move forward and shared this information immediately with public health labs.\"\nThe CDC statement also suggested that the agency was not exclusively responsible for testing delays.\nThe CDC was \"not an impediment\" to getting large-scale commercial testing started, according to the statement. That was the role of the FDA, and as the initial US cases were being detected in late January and early February, CDC director Dr Robert Redfield highlighted the need for that agency to act, according to the CDC statement.\nAlberto Gutierrez, who led the FDA's office overseeing diagnostic testing from 2009 to 2017, said the agency proceeded with caution because it saw itself as the last line of defense against opportunistic companies looking to cash in on threats to public health. \"There is money to be made in an emergency, and a lot of people try to take advantage of that,\" Gutierrez said. \"The problem the FDA faces is, do you let it become the Wild West?\"\n\"The FDA had good intentions,\" he said.\nRAMPING UP\nIn mid-February, cases spiked at a secretive church in the southeastern city of Daegu. On February 26, Daegu city officials said they would test every single member of the church, including those without symptoms.\nAs of March 10, Daegu said that it had tested almost all of the 10,000 members of the church in that area, and about 40% came back positive. The city, which now accounts for about three-quarters of total infections in South Korea, has seen new cases sharply drop. On Wednesday, officials announced 46 new cases compared to a peak of 741 cases on February 29.\nThe country went from two approved test makers on February 18 to five as of last week, according to the Korean CDC.\n\"To my surprise, test kit makers were able to boost production quickly,\" Korean CDC's Lee Sang-won said.\nPLEADING WITH WASHINGTON\nBy February 24, state and local labs in the United States were pleading with the FDA to relax its rules so the nation no longer had to rely so heavily on the CDC for testing. They asked Hahn, the FDA commissioner, for \"enforcement discretion\" so they could use their own lab-developed tests.\n\"We are now many weeks into the response with still no diagnostic or surveillance test available outside of CDC for the vast majority of our member laboratories,\" Scott Becker, chief executive of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, and Grace Kubin, lab services director at the Texas Department of State Health Services, wrote to Hahn on February 24 in a letter reviewed by Reuters.\nIn an interview, Becker, whose group represents more than 100 state and local health laboratories, called the letter a \"Hail Mary\" pass, an act of desperation.\n\"The entire lab community was really coming unglued. We knew we could develop tests and were very capable of doing that, but we felt hamstrung\" Becker told Reuters.\nThat same day, the Trump administration confirmed the first death in the United States from the coronavirus, a man in his 50s in Washington state.\nOn March 2, Stenzel at the FDA's diagnostic testing office hosted a webinar for lab test developers, highlighting additional challenges, including a shortage of viral samples needed for validation of test results. Some labs also have reported shortages of other key supplies and ingredients, as well as the need for more trained personnel.\nAs US regulators rewrote their policies, South Korean municipalities were opening roadside testing facilities across the country, collecting samples in minutes while people sat in their cars.\nAt a closed-door meeting last week in Congress, US Representative Raul Ruiz, a Democrat from California and an emergency-room physician who treated patients during the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak, pressed the FDA commissioner and other members of the Trump administration on why South Korea was lapping the United States in its response.\n\"Why don't we have drive-through testing like South Korea?\" Ruiz asked leaders of the president's coronavirus task force.\nRuiz told Reuters the officials said they were working on it. On their own, some hospitals and communities have begun offering drive-through testing in Colorado, New York, Texas and elsewhere.\nIn recent days, as the public criticism grew louder, Trump appointed a testing czar to improve coordination across agencies. The FDA launched a 24-hour hotline for laboratories needing help to accelerate testing, approved two company applications for higher-volume testing and granted states the flexibility to authorize new tests so labs can bypass the FDA.\nDespite the new moves, Ruiz said he fears America is still weeks away from approaching what South Korea has accomplished. \"I think months have been lost here,\" Ruiz said. \"Maybe we should look into purchasing South Korea's tests.\"\nThat may happen. Both Kogene and SolGent Co, two of the Covid-19 test-makers approved in South Korea, said their companies have an eye on the US market.\n\"The FDA asked us to proceed with applications quickly,\" Kogene executive Myoah Baek said.\n(Chad Terhune reported from Los Angeles; Dan Levine and Jane Lee reported from San Francisco and Hyunjoo Jin from South Korea.

What is known about the new virus in China. The new 2019-nCoV coronavirus that emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan has caused one of the biggest health crises in recent years. What follows are the certainties and open questions about the episode. How did the outbreak start? On December 31, the Chinese authorities notified 27 cases of pneumonia of unknown origin, seven of them serious. Those affected were apparently linked to a market in the city of Wuhan, a large metropolis with 11 million inhabitants. The cause of the ailment was identified on January 7 as a new coronavirus. China reported days later that the pathogen could be transmitted from person to person. What symptoms does the virus cause? The virus infects the respiratory tract and causes symptoms ranging from mild symptoms (dry cough, fever ...) to acute respiratory failure and life-threatening pneumonia. How is it spread? The mechanisms have not been precisely determined, although the most accepted way is through contact and through small drops of saliva that the virus carrier excretes when coughing. The contagion occurs between people who are close, at a distance of approximately one meter at most. Are there asymptomatic cases? It is not yet known exactly, although experts consider it probable, as has happened with other similar viruses. Is there treatment? There is no specific treatment or vaccine, although there are several projects underway to achieve it. Medical assistance focuses on the symptoms and on giving life support to the patient. Antivirals such as oseltamivir, baloxavir, ribavirin, and acyclovir are not effective against the virus. China studies the combined use of lopinavir and ritonavir. How is it diagnosed? China released the genetic sequence of the virus on January 10, three days after it was identified. This made it possible to create a specific diagnostic protocol that all member countries have. Without the tests, it is practically impossible to distinguish it from another type of pneumonia, or even the flu. Large hospitals have a technology, called PCR, that allows confirming the virus infection in a few hours, although in Spain official confirmations depend on the National Center for Microbiology. What is the evolution of the disease? The number of affected has not stopped growing since last December 31 and the trend continues to be upward both in China and in other countries. Has the virus spread rapidly? Experts emphasize that the great speed of spread of the virus. The cases registered in China in less than a month - on January 29 they have exceeded 6,000 - exceed the 5,300 diagnosed with SARS. What is a coronavirus? They are an extensive family of viruses that affect humans and various species of animals. So far there have been six acquaintances that could make a person sick: four that cause the common cold, SARS (which also emerged in 2002 in China) and MERS (in 2012 in Saudi Arabia). Coronaviruses that only affect some species can undergo mutations that allow them to jump to others and become virulent for humans. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused more than 800 deaths and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has caused 2,500 confirmed cases and 850 deaths. Research carried out so far indicates that the origin of both is in bats and this is the main hypothesis also in that of Wuhan. How fatal is the new Wuhan virus? Experts point out that the mortality rate of the new pathogen is low, between 2% and 3%, compared to similar viruses, according to the first available data. The SARS virus is attributed a mortality of between 10% and 18%, and that of MERS reaches 35% of reported patients, according to the WHO. Could the virus mutate and become more virulent? Although every virus is susceptible to undergoing a mutation, since it was located it has remained quite stable, according to the WHO, which warns that it is a scenario that cannot be ruled out. What measures have been taken? China has decided to quarantine the city of Wuhan, from which it is not possible to leave or enter since last morning, and more than a dozen nearby towns. In them, the use of masks has become widespread. In all, it has confined more than 46 million people. Airports in the vast majority of Asian countries, as well as the United States, United Kingdom and Russia, among others, have established control measures to detect travelers with compatible symptoms coming from the affected areas. Wuhan airport remains practically closed. What is WHO doing? The organization has monitored the evolution of the outbreak practically from day one, since it has placed coronaviruses among the threats to cause a future global pandemic. The emergency committee has met twice and, although very divided, has not yet decided to declare an international emergency, although in the last week of January the rating of global threat posed by the virus has changed from &quot;moderate&quot; to &quot;high&quot;. . What does the declaration of international emergency imply? The declaration of a public health emergency of international importance is adopted when an outbreak is a &quot;serious, sudden, unusual and unexpected&quot; situation with health consequences whose impact extends beyond the affected country. The declaration begins the process that makes possible immediate and coordinated international action. The WHO has made this decision five times: for influenza A in 2009, against polio in 2014, against Ebola in West Africa in 2014, against Zika in 2016 and last July against Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Is there a risk for Spain? The Ministry of Health considers that &quot;taking into account the controls carried out by the Chinese authorities, the risk of introduction of the virus in Spain at this time is considered very low.&quot; In any case, even if the virus did arrive, &quot;the impact on public health&quot; would also be &quot;very low.&quot; What will the new coronavirus be called? At the moment, it has a provisional 2019-nCoV (new virus of 2019), but the WHO will decide a definitive one. Normally, they are named after the place where they were discovered, so it will probably be the Wuhan virus."}, {"content": "Coronavirus boosts sales of &quot;The Plague&quot; and &quot;Essay on Blindness&quot; in Italy. The Covid-19 epidemic, caused by a new coronavirus, has boosted online sales of Albert Camus&#39;s novels &quot;The Plague&quot; and Jos\u00e9 Saramago&#39;s &quot;Essay on Blindness&quot; in Italy, Europe&#39;s most affected. In times of fear of the new coronavirus detected in December in China, several events and cultural facilities have already been canceled to prevent the spread, but, on the other hand, the search for books, movies, series or games that address the theme of pandemics, has been increasing since the beginning of the year. The latest indicators show an increase in sales of books such as &quot;The Plague&quot; (1947), by the French-Algerian writer Albert Camus, Nobel Prize for Literature and whose 60th anniversary of his death marks this year, who speaks of a plague epidemic in the 1940s that quickly took over the entire city of Oran, Algeria. Subject to quarantine, this city becomes an unbreathable territory and its inhabitants are led into states of suffering, madness, but also compassion. Last month in Italy -- the worst-affected European country, with 3,089 confirmed cases of infection -- more than 50,000 people were quarantined because of the Covid-19 outbreak. In this country, Camus&#39;s book rose to third place in the top sellers of the ibs portal, when a month ago it was in 71st place, reports the Italian newspaper &quot;La Repubblica&quot;, according to which the Amazon platform also registered this week a the book rose in the ranking of the classic category, having tripled its sales. In France, something similar happened, with 8,889 copies of &quot;The Plague&quot; to be sold in the first two months of the year, when in the whole of last year the total sales stood at 22,400, according to the sales statistics portal of Edistat books. Also the &quot;Essay on blindness&quot; (1995), by Jos\u00e9 Saramago, a writer who won the Nobel Prize for Literature three years later, became a literary phenomenon in Italy, reaching the top-10 of the ibs and 5th place in the Amazon, with a 180% increase in sales. The story tells of an epidemic of white blindness, which begins with a man becoming inexplicably blind, when he finds himself in a car in the middle of traffic, and which spreads like wildfire, to collective blindness. A similar situation to the search for these books is happening with films like &quot;Contagio&quot; (2011), by Steven Soderbergh, in which a woman returning from a business trip to Hong Kong dies of an alleged flu, but the virus spreads and the deadly epidemic spreads, with doctors racing against time to try to identify the virus and fight it and end the panic of the population. &quot;Contagion&quot; is already among the ten most watched movies on iTunes and among the fifteen most downloaded, according to &#39;Google Trends&#39;. Netflix&#39;s documentary &quot;Pandemia&quot;, which features the heroes of a battle with the flu and their work to stop a worldwide outbreak that is not caused by the coronavirus, but shows that the world&#39;s health care system is not prepared for facing a global health crisis has also become a central topic on Twitter. And as fear sells, there are already several predictions running on social networks, one of them related in the novel &quot;The Eyes of Darkness&quot;, by the American science fiction writer Dean Koontz. Published in 1981, with a reprint in 1989, the book has a chapter that talks about a disease called Wuhan-400, which is actually a biological weapon created in that Chinese city. The page describing the consequences of the virus itself went viral, especially on Twitter: &quot;They call it Wuhan-400 because it was created in one of the RDNA research labs outside the city of Wuhan, and it was strain No. 400 of man-made micro-organisms created in this center. Wuhan is the perfect weapon. It only affects human beings. No other living being can be a carrier.&quot; Viral also became an image of the comic book &quot;Asterix in Italy&quot;, published in 2017, where a coachman named Coronavirus participates in a chariot race, although it has nothing to do with any illness, being just a curiosity for name and country. In these days of searching for catastrophic omens, also a warning from Bill Gates, made in February 2017, was circulated. At the time, the co-founder of Microsoft said that a pathogen that spreads through the air and moves quickly &quot;could kill more than 30 million people in less than a year&quot;, although previously, in 2015, he warned, during a lecture, that the world was not ready &quot;for the next epidemic.&quot; More catastrophic is writer Sylvia Browne&#39;s description in her 2008 book &quot;End of Days: Predictions and Prophecies About the End of the World&quot;, which has also spread across social media, according to which a respiratory disease would break out all over the planet in the year 2020, and it wouldn&#39;t disappear until ten years later. The Covid-19 outbreak, detected in December in China, and which can cause respiratory infections such as pneumonia, caused around 3,300 deaths and infected more than 95,000 people in 79 countries, including eight in Portugal. Of those infected, more than 50,000 recovered. In addition to 3,012 deaths in China, there are reports of fatalities in Iran, Italy, South Korea, Japan, France, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Australia, Thailand, the United States of America and the Philippines, San Marino, Iraq, Switzerland and Spain. A Portuguese cruise ship crew member is hospitalized in Japan with confirmed infection. In Portugal, the Directorate-General for Health (DGS) confirmed eight cases of infection, of which six in Porto, one in Coimbra and one in Lisbon. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the Covid-19 outbreak an international public health emergency and increased the risk to &quot;very high&quot;."}, {"content": "What we don\u2019t yet know about the coronavirus. (Reuters) - It has been only three months since reports first emerged from China of an unknown virus causing unusual cases of pneumonia, and scientists and public health experts already know more about it and how it works than at the same point in earlier outbreaks.\nBut there\u2019s still a lot they don\u2019t know.\nAs the new coronavirus continues to spread around the world, here are some of the most important questions researchers and doctors \u2013 as well as policymakers and economists \u2013 are still trying to answer:\nHow contagious is the virus?\nThe virus spreads from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth via coughing or sneezing, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). It can persist on most surfaces up to several days, so in addition to directly inhaling the virus, you can become infected by touching something that has been contaminated and then touching your own nose, mouth or eyes. There is some evidence that virus particles in the feces of an infected person can transmit the disease through contact, but that remains unconfirmed.\nHow many people are infected, and how many do not show any symptoms?\nSo far, more than 550,000 cases have been reported worldwide, of which more than 127,000 have recovered and more than 24,000 have died. Some researchers estimate that up to 80% of people who are infected show no or only mild symptoms and may not even know they are sick. That would put the number of people who might have been infected in the millions. But we need many more studies and much more testing to close in on a more accurate number.\nGraphic: Tracking the spread of the coronavirus, here\nAre younger people less likely to die from the virus?\nYounger people, while less vulnerable, can still develop COVID-19 - the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus -  severe enough to require hospitalization. Just how much safer they are is still unanswered. The WHO says older people with pre-existing conditions - such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, high blood pressure, diabetes and heart disease - appear to develop serious illness more often than others, while a U.S. health official said the mortality rate in males appears to be twice that of women in every age group. Health officials have cautioned that anyone with those underlying conditions, as well as those with weakened immune systems, are at increased risk.\nCan people be re-infected?\nThis is a key question \u2013 and we don\u2019t yet know the answer. There are a handful of cases of possible \u201creinfection\u201d in recovered patients. But most scientists believe those are more likely to have been relapses. A patient may feel better and test negative for the virus in their nose and throat, while the virus remains elsewhere in their body. Fully recovered patients have antibodies in their blood that should protect them from fresh infection, but we don\u2019t know how long those antibodies will last. With some viruses, antibodies fade faster. Even if they do persist, SARS-CoV-2 might undergo small changes over time, as flu viruses do each year, rendering the antibodies ineffective.\nSeveral academic laboratories and medical companies are looking to produce blood tests to figure out who has been exposed to the virus and whether some people have developed immunity. Serological testing will also give a better picture of the full extent of the pandemic.\nDo we know when there will be treatments or a vaccine?\nNo. So far there are no vaccines or antiviral medicines specific to the new coronavirus. Treatment for now focuses on relieving symptoms such as breathing assistance. Companies around the world are racing to develop vaccines. A few have launched early safety testing in humans, but experts say it could take a year or more to develop and test a vaccine. Another complication: viruses can mutate quickly. Some scientists have already identified subtle changes since SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan, China, in December. But recent studies show the virus is relatively stable, which suggests vaccines should still be effective when they become available.\nDoes the virus spread more slowly in hot places?\nSome experts had hoped that the onset of summer will naturally slow the virus. But the European Centre for Disease Control said on Wednesday that it is unlikely to diminish its spread. The WHO has also said that the virus can be transmitted in all areas, including hot and humid climates.\nHow long will the pandemic last?\nWe don\u2019t know. It will depend on a range of factors, from how long people continue to isolate and avoid group gatherings to when effective drugs or a vaccine become available. President Donald Trump said this week that he hopes to \u201creopen\u201d the U.S. economy by Easter Sunday on April 12. But he has faced criticism that such a timetable is too rushed and could lead to more people dying. In Hubei province, the epicenter of China\u2019s coronavirus outbreak, life has started to return to normal after two months of lockdown. It remains to be seen whether such a return to normal spurs another outbreak.\nDoes the amount of exposure to the virus determine how sick someone gets?\nViruses enter the body and infect cells, using them as factories to make many millions of copies of themselves, so the number of virus particles that first enter the body has little effect on the eventual amount of virus in the system. At the same time, more frequent exposure does increase the chance that the virus will enter the body in the first place.\nWhen will the economy return to normal?\nThe International Monetary Fund expects the pandemic will cause a global recession in 2020 that could be worse than the one triggered by the 2008 financial crisis. The depth of a recession, how long it will last and the nature of the recovery are a matter of debate. Economists say it will largely depend on how long the lockdowns last \u2013 around a quarter of all humanity is currently in lockdown \u2013 and how far government support goes in helping individuals, businesses and markets survive the crisis.\nAre the trillions of dollars in emergency spending helping?\nCentral bank measures have sought to keep financial markets functioning, including areas that keep the real economy humming, such as the markets where companies go to raise short term cash to pay staff and where cities go to raise money for roads and schools. Steps taken by governments, such as the $2 trillion U.S. stimulus package, are expected to further help the economy by putting cash in the hands of individuals and providing additional funding to small businesses and companies. Such measures still need to work through the system, however, and it remains unclear whether they will be enough.\nIs it a good time to invest?\nSome investors and bank strategists are starting to look at whether people should buy back into the world\u2019s stock markets, which have plunged some 25% from their highs in February. U.S. hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said this week he had turned increasingly positive on stocks and credit and was \u201credeploying our capital in companies we love at bargain prices that are built to withstand this crisis.\u201d But with all the uncertainties, many more analysts and investors remain shy about calling the bottom of the market.\nGraphic: COVID-19 in the United States, here"}, {"content": "Weak economic data, coronavirus spook investors. \nThere seems to be little respite in sight for the markets - which have just seen their worst week in a decade - as the impact of coronavirus has started reflecting in economic data.\nFactory activity in China, the global engine of growth, has contracted at the fastest pace on record with China\u2019s official Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) falling to a fresh low of 35.7 in February against 50 in January.\nFurther, China and South Korea continued to report more coronavirus cases over the weekend, while\u00a0 the US, Australia, and Thailand reported their first cases of death.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tough period,\u201d said Shankar Sharma, founder and vice-chairman of First Global.\n\u201cCoronavirus is a serious problem and can lop off quite a bit from global growth.\u201d\nThe Sensex and Nifty crashed nearly 4 per cent on Friday - the biggest single-day fall since 2015 - to end at 38,297 and 11,202, respectively.\nBoth indices are down nearly 9 per cent from their all-time highs in mid-January.\nOn previous occasions, indices have rebounded sharply after a near-10 per cent drop.\nHowever, a sharp reversal seems difficult this time as the peak impact of the virus is yet to play out.\nThe India VIX surged 31 per cent on Friday, a sign that traders expect the markets - which are back to October levels - to remain highly volatile.\nFurther, most global indices have entered \u201ccorrection zone\u201d, posting a 10 per cent decline from recent highs.\nMany don\u2019t rule out a \u201cbear market\u201d - a fall of 20 per cent from highs - if the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) warning of a global pandemic comes true.\nThe US markets fell 4 per cent in intra-day trade on Friday, before paring losses to end 1.4 per cent lower.\nIn addition, the US 10-year Treasury hit a record low of 1.114 per cent, before settling at 1.163 per cent.\nMarket players say such low reading on the 10-year Treasury is a sign of extreme anxiety.\nForeign portfolio investors (FPIs) pulled out close to Rs 12,000 crore last week.\nDomestic investors pumped in an even higher amount, but it did little to stem the fall in share prices.\nSharma said overseas investors typically \u201cchase momentum\u201d and there isn\u2019t much predictability to their flows.\nAs regards a recovery, market players have not ruled out a bounce-back on account of technical factors such as short-covering.\n\u201cHistorically, global events that have caused a meltdown in markets have proved lucrative investment opportunities.\n\"The key point to remember is that we do not know for how long the current crisis may play out.\n\"Therefore, while investing in such times, it is better to make staggered investments,\u201d said S Naren, executive director and chief investment officer of ICICI Prudential AMC"}, {"content": "RPT-China's online censors tighten grip after brief coronavirus respite. (Repeats Feb 11 story with no changes in text)\nBEIJING, Feb 11 (Reuters) - China\u2019s coronavirus outbreak has tested the limits of free speech on the country\u2019s heavily censored online and social media, with a brief window of liberalization that opened during January subsequently slammed shut by authorities.\nWhile censorship in China has tightened under President Xi Jinping, questions of transparency around the current outbreak are especially sensitive after Beijing\u2019s cover-up of the extent of the 2003 SARS epidemic fuelled suspicion and mistrust, and led to official calls for openness this time around.\nThe period from Jan 19 to Feb 1, when public concern about the coronavirus exploded just as China was gearing up for the Lunar New Year holiday, saw an uncharacteristic loosening. Online buzz about the outbreak flourished, with netizens largely unfettered in criticizing local authorities - but not central government leaders - over their handling of the crisis.\nThat liberalisation has come to end, with censors in the past week shutting down WeChat groups and scrubbing social media posts, according to Chinese reporters.

It\u2019s highly likely their brief is to paint a rosier picture of the government\u2019s relief efforts rather than engage in any muckraking or critical reporting.\u201d\nThe cyberspace regulator, Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), did not respond to phone calls or to requests for comment sent by fax.\nChina\u2019s censorship machine was tested last week when Li Wenliang, a Chinese doctor who had been reprimanded for issuing an early warning about coronavirus, died of the disease, triggering widespread outrage as well as mourning.\nOnline media outlets were permitted to report on Li\u2019s death, but not the anger it had engendered, and early discussions on social media calling for the Wuhan government to apologise to him later disappeared.\nA notice sent to editors working for an online Chinese news outlet and seen by Reuters asked them not to \u201ccomment or speculate\u201d on Li\u2019s death, \u201cdo not hashtag and let the topic gradually die out from the hot search list, and guard against harmful information.\u201d\nSarah Cook, the China media bulletin director at Freedom House, said that previous crises had also seen brief windows of openness, such as the deadly 2011 crash of a high-speed train and the devastating 2008 Sichuan earthquake, when domestic journalists and social media users felt emboldened.\n\u201cAt the same time, initially, officials might be a bit flat-footed and distracted dealing with an unexpected crisis so things slip through the cracks. Even censors within some social media companies may be sympathetic to some of the content and let it through,\u201d she said.\nThe brief window of media freedom came after officials in Wuhan, where the outbreak started, admitted that it was much worse than anticipated and were heavily criticised for their move in January to reprimand eight people for \u201cspreading rumours\u201d on the emergence of the virus - one of whom was Li.\nLast week, however, CAC announced that it had punished some websites, mobile applications and social media accounts for publishing illicit content on the outbreak, saying it wanted to foster a \u201cgood online atmosphere\u201d amid the country\u2019s efforts to contain the epidemic.\nA notice circulated by CAC last week that was seen by Reuters asked audio and video platforms to step up control on \u201charmful information and rumour\u201d related to Wuhan virus.\nIt also asked them to stick to official media such as Xinhua and People\u2019s Daily, \u201cnot to push any negative story, and not to conduct non-official livestreaming on the virus.\u201d\nSome investigative articles published by local media outlets from Wuhan have also been deleted.\nChen Qiushi, a citizen journalist who was sending dispatches from Wuhan over Twitter - which is blocked in China - including images of corpses in the city\u2019s hospitals, has been forcibly put under quarantine since Friday, according to his family and a friend managing his account in his absence.\nMany Chinese Internet users have turned to black humour or shared images, songs and other art forms in private WeChat groups to express their dismay.

WASHINGTON (AFP) - Thousands of people have died, the United States response has infuriated European allies, and China has gone on a propaganda offensive. The new coronavirus is shaping up to be a cataclysmic event with far-reaching consequences in global politics. \n The Covid-19 pandemic, which has infected more than 130,000 people globally, strikes a world already in flux with the rise of nationalists such as US President Donald Trump who have scoffed at the rules of the \"globalist\" order. \n \"When the dust settles on the Covid-19 world, we won't be in the same place that we were just a week ago,\" said Mr Jon Alterman, a senior vice-president at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \n \"We know that governments will shake as citizens judge them to have fumbled in their response. We know that economies will be disrupted and some economies are likely to collapse,\" he said. \n Mr Trump, who initially dismissed the risks of Covid-19, late on Wednesday (March 11) abruptly imposed a 30-day ban on most travel from mainland Europe and vowed to confront the \"foreign virus\". Leaders from the European Union voiced outrage at the move, which triggered chaos at airports, and said that they had not been consulted - which Mr Trump acknowledged. \n Ms Kelly Magsamen, the vice-president for national security and international policy at the left-leaning Centre for American Progress, said Mr Trump's move would only increase questions about Washington's historic leadership role. \n \"I think a lot of partners and allies are saying, can the US be relied upon to lead on major global challenges - whether it's a pandemic or whether it's climate change or nonproliferation?\" she said. \n \"It's going to have effects on other dimensions of our relationship.\" \n Covid-19 first emerged late last year in the Chinese metropolis of Wuhan - likely at a market that sold exotic animals for their meat - and Beijing initially tried to suppress the news including by detaining the doctor who sounded the alarm. \n But China in the past week has sought to turn its Covid-19 response into a sort of soft power, with President Xi Jinping visiting Wuhan to trumpet success at containing the spread. \n China has sent medical equipment to Italy, the second-worst hit country, and Spain, highlighting its authoritarian model as decisive. \n It has also used the crisis as leverage against the United States, which has been seeking to combat Beijing's influence in all areas. \n An article in the state-run Global Times unsubtly hinted that China could stop exports of face masks and other medical gear if the Trump administration keeps pressing to restrict its tech giant Huawei. \n China as well as Russia has also promoted unfounded conspiracy theories to discredit the US. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian suggested on Twitter that the US military may have brought the coronavirus to Wuhan. \n The Trump administration, which has offered US$100 million (S$141 million) in aid worldwide to help other countries deal with the pandemic, has in turn sought to associate China firmly with Covid-19. \n Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speaks of the illness as the \"Wuhan virus\" and Republican Senator Tom Cotton has vowed that the US will \"hold accountable those who inflicted it on the world.\" \n Mr Michael Green, who was the top Asia adviser to former president George W. Bush, doubted that China would ultimately find many buyers for its \"arguments about the failures of democracy\". \n But he added: \"That does not mean that the US will win this information battle.\" \n \"While the Japanese and others in Asia are not getting the shock treatment that the Europeans got overnight, there is a very strong sense of questioning American leadership right now,\" said Mr Green, now a senior vice-president at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. \n In one example, Mr Green pointed to the stalemate in talks over South Korea's contributions to US bases, with Mr Trump irritating the ally by insisting on much higher payments. \n One broader effect, Mr Green said, may be a shifting political narrative. \n Mr Xi, once seen as untouchable in China, has faced criticism as netizens cheer on doctors - much like Americans across party lines have hailed Dr Anthony Fauci, the 79-year-old veteran head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. \n Mr Trump's 2016 upset win, Britain's vote to leave the European Union and other populist victories had been seen as proof \"that the technocrats failed\" following the Great Recession of the late 2000s and the Iraq war, Mr Green said. \n \"I think it's very possible that the macro result this time could be that the political populists failed and it's the technocrats who emerge as the heroes,\" Mr Green said. \n \"We'll see. But that may be how political history turns in this chapter.\""}, {"content": "g20 leaders pledge s$7.2tn in 'united' response to coronavirus crisis.

A doctor from Mumbai has sought help from the Indian government to get his mother's body back from China, which is hit by the coronavirus epidemic.\n\nThe body has been kept at the morgue of a hospital in Zhengzhou since January 24, when Rita Rajinder Mehra died.\nDentist Puneet Mehra, 35, told PTI that the Indian Embassy in Beijing informed him on Monday that the transportation of his mother's body has got delayed in view of the restrictions on movement of people and vehicles in China after the outbreak of coronavirus epidemic in the neighbouring country.\nThe Bandra-based doctor has, thus, sought desperate help from the central government to get back his mother's body at the earliest so that her last rites can be performed in Mumbai with due respect.\nAccording to the doctor, on January 24, he and his mother were travelling from Melbourne to Mumbai via Beijing on Air China flight.\nAfter about nine hours of the flight take-off, his mother went to the lavatory but did not return for a long time, following which Mehra alerted the crew.\nThe lavatory door was later opened and Mehra's mother was found in an unconscious state, he said.\nA doctor and a nurse, who were among the passengers, and the crew tried cardiopulmonary resuscitation and later the plane made an emergency landing at Zhengzhou Airport, but she had died by then, he said.\nPuneet Mehra returned on February 7, but his mother's body is still at the morgue of Henan Provincial Hospital in Zhengzhou.\nThe doctor has written to President Ram Nath Kovind, office of the External Affairs Ministry and the Ambassador of India in Beijing to help in getting back the body.\n\"I have also written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and requested the government to facilitate the process of transportation of my mother's remains back to Mumbai at the earliest so that the last rites can be performed with due respect,\" Mehra said.\nHe said this situation has caused a lot of stress to him and my family.\n\"It has been over 24 days now and we are extremely shattered and going through a lot of emotional stress in this helpless situation,\" he said.\nHe said the hospital in China initially issued a certificate mentioning the cause of his mother's demise as 'death before rescue'.\nAfter three days, the hospital gave Mehra another certificate mentioning the cause as 'sudden cardiac death very likely'.\nLater, another certificate was issued mentioning the cause as 'sudden death', he said.\nMehra further said he got a reply from Arvind Kumar (Consular) at the Embassy of India in China, saying the embassy is also very concerned about the issue and has full sympathy with the family at this tragic time.\nBut, China is also facing an equally tragic situation.\nThe outbreak of the new coronavirus epidemic has 'completely derailed normal life' in China, particularly in Hubei and adjoining provinces, due to severity of the spread and number of deaths that have taken place so far, he said.\nIn a bid to contain spread of the virus, the Chinese government has put up widespread and severe restrictions on the movement of people and vehicles.\nThis has resulted in hardest obstacles in inter-provincial movement of people and vehicles. Hence, there is a delay in transportation of the mortal remains of Rita Rajinder Mehra to India by the agency hired by Puneet Mehra, Kumar said in his reply.\nThe consular also said that as per the existing regulations in China, funeral homes in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou only are authorised to carry out embalming and anti-sepsis procedures of mortal remains of a foreigner for air transportation.\nAs of now, the Chinese government has placed complete restrictions on the funeral homes from accepting a body from any place out of these three cities. It means these funeral homes can only deal with the body that pertains to the respective city, he mentioned.\nAnother major obstacle in transporting the mortal remains from the morgue of Zhengzhou to Beijing is severe restrictions on inter-provincial movements, he informed Mehra.\n\"While it is going to be our earnest endeavour with the Chinese authorities to seek their indulgence in allowing the concession in the imposed regulations to allow the mortal remains to be transported to India, yet we cannot predict at this stage whether our pursuance would melt the Chinese authorities,\" Kumar said.\n\"However, we will try our hardest and hope as well as pray that we succeed.

Hong Kong/Canada/New York (Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence) - Private organizations and government agencies are scrambling to implement business continuity planning (BCP) measures for the 2019 novel coronavirus, an infectious disease that came into broader public knowledge mere weeks ago.\nTo date, more than 17,000 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus have been documented worldwide, with the majority of the cases clustered in Hubei province, China. To try to curb infection rates, the Chinese government has implemented social distancing policies which have substantially slowed business activity in the region. Other countries are increasingly implementing ad hoc measures, including travel restrictions and quarantine measures, to prevent an outbreak from occurring in their respective jurisdictions.\nDevelopments are unfolding at an accelerated pace and organizations have much ground to cover in BCPs. The maintenance of operational agility, succession planning and employee morale are just some of the main considerations at play.\nIn mainland China, the Chinese government has extended the Chinese New Year holiday through February 2, to encourage social distancing to mitigate the spread of the virus. Provincial and national regulators have issued guidance for employers regarding employee rights and entitlements to remuneration during this time. Uncertainty regarding the interpretation of these regulatory notices has caused confusion over whether some business continuity practices, such as requesting employees to use vacation days during the extended holiday, are legal.\nEnterprise Singapore, a government agency, has issued a guide{here} on business continuity planning for the novel coronavirus. The guide recommends that businesses appoint a designated manager to oversee coronavirus-related business continuity measures. The importance of succession planning for key personnel in addition to senior managers, including communications, human resources and operations staff is heavily emphasized. Businesses are also advised to establish alternate teams for critical operational functions and to keep these teams physically segregated at all times.\nIn practice, segregating teams may require businesses to place extensive restrictions on employees, even outside working hours. For example, the South China Morning Post, an English language newspaper in Hong Kong, established separate workspaces for alternate teams in different districts of the city during a regional outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. Alternate teams were sent to work in different locations and were prohibited from having any physical contact with members of the other team during and after work hours for a period of three months.\nMany companies in Hong Kong have activated extensive BCPs for the novel coronavirus in comparison to jurisdictions with similar numbers of confirmed cases, partially due to containment measures from the local government, lessons learned during the SARs outbreak and the region\u2019s close proximity to mainland China. Measures that have been implemented include remote working arrangements for a large percentage of the workforce. Some companies have provided personal protection supplies such as surgical masks and hand disinfectant for employees who have to come to the office to perform their job duties. Policies suspending business travel to cluster areas for the coronavirus have been implemented by numerous businesses. Some organizations have even sought to prohibit employee personal travel to cluster areas.\nIn comparison, there have been fewer reports of companies in South Korea, Japan or Thailand implementing business continuity measures such as asking employees to work from home or limiting employee travel.\nIn Canada, some businesses have begun to execute pandemic preparedness measures such as training staff on what to do if they encounter someone who is ill, or if a customer-facing employee should fall ill at work. Local disaster management experts have expressed concern that some organizations, especially smaller firms, may lack the adequate resources or expertise to put measures in place that can effectively deal with employee health and operational risks posed by the novel coronavirus.\nInternationally, businesses are struggling with disruptions to their supply chains in China{here}, where manufacturing and logistics activity has slowed to a crawl across the country. Technology companies are expected to be most affected; however, many other commodities, goods and services will also be significantly affected. Companies such as H&M, Japan Airlines, Baidu Inc, McDonald's and Tesla have all recently warned that the outbreak in China will have an impact on their businesses.\nBCP for the novel coronavirus is proving to be difficult, requiring businesses to consider operational and financial risks alongside health risks to one of their most valuable assets: talent. Safeguarding the wellbeing of employees plays an important role in keeping a company operational during this uncertain time. While practices implemented by companies have delved into infection control measures such as personal hygiene and social distancing, challenges in maintaining employee morale have not been discussed with the same fervor.\nSome important issues to consider in BCPs include how to handle fear and xenophobia that have arisen due to concerns over the novel coronavirus. BCP designated personnel need to consider how to manage anxiety in the workplace, even over scenarios that would be benign during normal times, such as an employee who shows up to work with a minor cough.\nBusinesses that choose to implement work from home arrangements for large swathes of the workforce will need to consider how to help employees who are not accustomed to working remotely stay motivated during this time, alongside infrastructure concerns such as bandwidth and capacity issues for remote access of work servers, conferencing lines and other necessities.\nMoreover, managers must consider how to balance their legal responsibility to treat all employees fairly against any measures the company may have to take to mitigate the risk of widespread infection at their firms. Consideration for the mental wellbeing of employees needs to be factored in alongside practices to safeguard their physical health against illness.\nPlanning for an extended and uncertain period time in which businesses may have to run on contingency measures is another significant consideration for businesses. The novel coronavirus remains somewhat of a mystery. Health agencies are in the midst of containment efforts; however, it is uncertain how long these initiatives may take to bring regional outbreaks under control, or if these initiatives will be successful at all in preventing more widespread infection. As a result, businesses must examine how they will function under different scenarios and at varying percentages of operational capacity. Critical tasks will have to be identified and many organizations will have to make tough decisions weighing risk against productivity just in order to stay afloat.\n*To read more by the Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence team click here: bit.ly/TR-RegIntel\n(By Helen Chan, Regulatory Intelligence)"}, {"content": "Breakingviews - China\u2019s viral immune system open to economic pox.

But everyone was not ready for the crisis, said Dr Tan, who is also president of the College of Family Physicians Singapore. \n Many continued to work but were extremely concerned that they might bring the virus home and put their loved ones at risk, he added. \n \u201cThe healthcare practitioners in Singapore were ill-prepared, which resulted in sombre outcomes. Since then, we have learnt our lesson and measures were instituted to prepare us for any future pandemic event.\u201d \n \u201cHere we are today, ready to fight the 2019-nCoV,\u201d he said. \n The current outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus -\u00a0or 2019-nCoV, the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) temporary name for the virus -\u00a0was first confirmed in Singapore on Jan 23. To date, all cases were imported, including a Singaporean who was in Wuhan, and there has been no evidence of community spread in the Republic. \n The WHO has yet to declare the virus -\u00a0which has spread to several countries -\u00a0as a pandemic. Nevertheless, it was declared a global health emergency on Friday (Jan 31). \n The first cases were reported in Wuhan in China\u2019s Hubei province and believed to be linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which sells live animals. \n At the heart of Singapore's response plan is the\u00a0Disease Outbreak Response System (DORS), a crisis management plan which did not exist in 2003, but was drafted after SARS\u00a0and refined again in the wake of the swine flu (or H1N1) pandemic in 2009. \n  \n \u201cAfter SARS, we made a thorough review of the facilities we had \u2013 the infrastructure, hospitals, isolation wards, and the scientific testing and capabilities,\u201d said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week. \n \u201cI think we are much better prepared now.\u201d \n Currently, Singapore is at DORS\u00a0condition (DORSCON) Yellow, signifying that the virus is severe and can infect from person to person, but is chiefly occurring outside Singapore. The next step up is DORSCON\u00a0Orange, which would have applied in the case of SARS, whereby the virus is spreading in Singapore but not widely, and is being contained. \n While the plans are in place and some measures have kicked in, Singapore\u2019s national strategy is still largely untested -\u00a0since the Wuhan coronavirus is believed to be in its early stages in the Republic, medical experts and SARS veterans said. \n However, there are ample signs that the lessons from SARS are being applied as Singapore shores up its defences, they said. They believe that unlike during\u00a0SARS, Singapore is far more ready now. \n LESSONS LEARNT \n Singapore has had two brushes with pandemics in recent memory -\u00a0SARS and H1N1. \n While Singapore was able to contain and recover from both, the varying nature of the viruses, as well as the changes in medical science, meant that dealing with each required different approaches. \n Doctors had limited options when treating SARS patients and could only administer supportive care, and there was nothing that could be done to prevent infection. In comparison, vaccines and treatment options were available when H1N1 claimed 18 lives in Singapore and infected more than 400,000 people, out of which about 1,300 had to be hospitalised. \n COMMAND AND CONTROL \n SARS\u00a0first arrived in Singapore in late February 2003, and was detected in\u00a0a woman with an atypical pneumonia on March 1, 2003 at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH). At the time, no one knew how deadly and virulent it was and the first patient led to a cluster of 42 cases at the hospital. \n A Ministry of Health (MOH) taskforce was set up on Mar\u00a015, two weeks after the mysterious strain appeared in Singapore and three days after the WHO issued a global alert on the outbreak that began in Hong Kong. \n But the command and control structure then was \u201cwholly inadequate\u201d in a crisis situation that was both fluid and unprecedented, a study in the Austrian Journal of South-east Asian Studies concluded in 2012. \n  \n The structure was led by the health authorities, when in hindsight, it required \u201cmore than a medical approach since resources had to be drawn from a number of government agencies that did not fall under the rubric of the MOH\u201d, said authors Allen Lai and Tan Teck Boon, who were from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. \n They noted that it took five weeks after the first case was reported for the bureaucracy to adapt, though by then, the outbreak had already spread quickly out of TTSH. \n On April 7, 2003, a national control structure was created in response to SARS, comprising a nine-member inter-ministerial committee led by then Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng to provide strategic and political directions during health crises. \n Helping to coordinate across silos were a core executive group of senior civil servants, and an operations committee spanning ministries. Their functions were later consolidated during the H1N1 crisis, which meant that this leaner bureaucracy was quicker to respond to emerging situations on the ground. \n With the Wuhan coronavirus, observers said that it was evident that the Government had reacted more quickly than in SARS and H1N1 when it came to establishing a multi-disciplinary decision-making body. \n Professor Ooi Eng Eong, an infectious diseases expert and virologist at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, noted that a multi-ministry taskforce on the Wuhan coronavirus was formed on Jan 22, several hours before the first suspected case came to the attention of the authorities at 10pm the same day. The patient - a 66-year-old Chinese national tourist from Wuhan - tested positive the next day, becoming the first confirmed case in Singapore. \n \u201cIf you look at the response time, it is a fact that the ministerial committee formed before the case appeared, and we can see that a lot of systems are\u00a0already in place, occurring across ministries and not as siloed as back then when SARS caught us all by surprise,\u201d said Prof Ooi, who is also deputy director of the Emerging Infectious Diseases Programme at Duke-NUS Medical School. \n The taskforce was formed to direct the whole-of-government response to the outbreak, coordinate the public\u2019s response and work with the international community. \n Jointly chaired by Health Minister Gan Kim Yong and National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, the taskforce comprises a cross-section of Cabinet ministers spanning various portfolios. They are: \n Dr Chia Shi-Lu, a Tanjong Pagar GRC Member of Parliament who chairs the Government Parliamentary Committee for Health, said that this time, the chain of command is clearer. \n He noted that even before the taskforce was formed, the MOH had already begun tracking the outbreak in China at the start of the year. Temperature screening measures were put in place at Changi Airport from as early as Jan 3. \n But the high political signature of the panel had led some to question whether too many cooks were spoiling the broth, Dr Chia noted. \u201cIn fact, some have asked me: Are we overdoing it?\u201d he said. \n \u201cI believe it is very important for everybody to come into the picture -\u00a0you have to, because at this early stage, (the outbreak) affects so many different parts and you need leadership from them, and you cannot rely solely on MOH to coordinate everything,\u201d he added. \n  \n INFRASTRUCTURE, CASE MANAGEMENT AND ISOLATION \n While information about the Wuhan virus is still emerging, Singapore\u00a0is not in the same position as in the initial stages of the SARS outbreak in 2003, where it was -\u00a0in the words of then Health Minister Lim Hng Kiang - \u201cflying blind\u201d. \n During the SARS crisis, Singapore only had two means to detect those infected with the virus: Their clinical symptoms and their travel history. Detecting these were not easy at the time as temperature screeners were also a rare resource, unlike today. \n \u201cWe have to depend on people taking temperature, and we have to depend on people being truthful to us in their contact history,\u201d said Mr Lim then, describing SARS as a tremendous challenge. \n Dr Tan Yia Swam, First Vice-President of the Singapore Medical Association (SMA), said that in the SARS crisis, \u201cthere were too many unknowns, and precautions came too late, and too slowly\u201d. SARS was zoonotic in nature, with the disease starting in animals before spreading to humans. \n As a result, policies and procedures regarding risk stratification, contact mapping, contact tracing, quarantine and others were developed on the fly as the epidemic erupted, she said. \n \u201cToday, all of the above have been developed and tested before in exercises and they are now put into action. Of course, these plans, policies and procedures must be modified in line with the epidemiology of the disease, but we are not working from scratch, unlike the past experience with SARS,\u201d she added. \n  \n Addressing the media on Monday, Mr Lawrence Wong said that in the taskforce\u2019s national response to the virus, it is able to \u201cmarshal all available resources\u201d to tackle the scourge. \n In terms of capacity, Singapore has already beefed up its healthcare and isolation capacity since 2003. This includes the 330-bed National Centre for Infectious Diseases that opened last year, and new hospitals such as Khoo Teck Puat Hospital in 2010, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital in 2015, and Sengkang General Hospital in 2018, he said. \n During SARS, TTSH was known as \u201cSARSCentral\u201d, the designated hospital to handle patients. This was borne out of a policy to restrict transmission of the virus to other hospitals, after a patient - who was unaware that he had been infected with the virus during his stay in TTSH - created a new viral cluster at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) when he went there for a surgical problem after his discharge from TTSH. \n This policy changed in 2009 during the H1N1 outbreak, with the Health Ministry imposing a standardised infection control measure on all healthcare facilities, empowered by timely tweaks to the Infectious Diseases Act. More than 400 family clinics were made \u201cH1N1-ready\u201d and equipped with the Tamiflu vaccine to handle the outbreak. \n  \n Similarly, all public hospitals are capable of handling the Wuhan virus today, and come equipped with isolation rooms, which were in short supply in 2003. \n When it came to medical supplies, Dr Chia recalled how there was hardly a stockpile of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers then, such as N95 respirators. \n \u201cBecause an N95 mask needs to fit well for it to perform its function, having a properly fitted mask was (hard to come by) during SARS, and we had to find time to do the fitting too,\u201d said Dr Chia, who was an orthopaedic surgeon at SGH at the height of the crisis. \n \u201cToday, most of us are already fitted with our own personal equipment, even as new staff. Everything is in place today,\u201d he said. \n  \n For the general public, the Government will be disbursing a pack of four surgical masks\u00a0to each of the 1.37 million Singapore households in a one-off exercise between Feb 1 and Feb 9. This was also done in 2003 when all households received a free emergency kit, containing N95 masks and themometers. \n This time round, the mask distribution comes amid long queues at pharmacies around the island as people clamour to buy masks, and retailers say their stocks of surgical masks and N95 masks are running low or sold out. The Government had released 5 million masks from its stockpile over nine days to the retailers but they were all snapped up in hours. \n Said Dr Chia: \u201cThe message is that there is enough for the whole of the population and in reserve too.\u201d \n SMA\u2019s Dr Tan said his association met with the College of Family Physicians Singapore over the Chinese New Year weekend to carry out \u201ccomplex logistics arrangements\u201d to ensure that there is a steady supply of surgical and N95 masks to replenish stocks for the frontline healthcare workers. \n \u201cWe are all monitoring the situation closely, and are ready to step up efforts when the need arises,\u201d he said. \n Experts noted that contingency plans have been put in place too - student hostels are converted into quarantine facilities in anticipation of future cases, and the Outward Bound Singapore on Pulau Ubin has been marked as a possible quarantine site. \n  \n TRICKY BALANCE IN THE FACE OF IMPONDERABLES \n On Monday, Mr Lawrence Wong also called on Singaporeans to be psychologically prepared that the Wuhan virus could be worse than SARS given the many \u201cimponderables\u201d and \u201cuncertainties\u201d regarding the infection, though he stressed that there is still no evidence of community spread of the disease in Singapore. \n Over the past week, however, the first reports of human-to-human transmissions outside of China have surfaced in Taiwan, Japan, Vietnam and Germany. \n Mr Lawrence Wong said Singapore\u2019s approach \u201cis to anticipate and move as swiftly as we can\u201d. \u201cBut every action we take really has to be based on evidence, data and international medical guidelines,\u201d he added. \n  \n Unlike SARS, which impacted Singapore when little was known about it, there is now a greater understanding about the coronavirus, a family of viruses that include the Wuhan strain and SARS. \n But data gaps still exist, said Professor Tikki Elka Pangestu, a visiting fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and a former director of the WHO\u2019s research policy and cooperation department in Geneva. \n Prof Pangestu said that not much is known of the proportion of mild and asymptomatic cases versus the severe and fatal ones, which currently makes it difficult to evaluate the Wuhan virus\u2019 true epidemic potential and complicates the outbreak response. \n There is also the worry that the virus could mutate into a more virulent and more highly transmissible strain. \u201cThis needs close monitoring and another data gap will be in how quickly this development can be evaluated,\u201d he said. \n Despite these gaps, Singapore has \u201creacted much more swiftly and comprehensively\u201d than in 2003, Prof Pangestu added. \n  \n A rule of thumb for any country\u2019s approach in health crises, he said, is to base decisions on scientific evidence and rational analysis in the context of its own capacities. \n \u201cI think the Singapore approach is the correct one given the current information and evidence available -\u00a0robust but not over-reactive and flexible enough to accommodate new developments,\u201d said Prof Pangestu. \n He noted that overreaction risks imposing an unjustifiable burden on the country, potentially impacting normal daily routines and the livelihoods of certain vulnerable segments of the population. Under-reaction, on the other hand, would lead to a more extensive spread of the virus. \n \u201cCalibrating the balance is tricky, but as I said, base your decisions on the existing scientific evidence,\u201d said Prof Pangestu. \n Prof Ooi from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health added: \u201cThere is a risk and cost to overreaction and a cost to an under-reaction. Nobody knows what is the right answer and there is no hard science to it -\u00a0this is a judgement call and there is no right or wrong.\u201d \n Where there is a dearth of knowledge on imported pandemic cases, Singapore\u2019s national strategy is flexible with the changing circumstances, and the plan recommends taking border control measures that would \u201cerr on the side of caution with more intense efforts until such time when the disease profile becomes clearer\u201d. \n Addressing the media on Friday, Mr Lee said: \u201cI think as a Government, in a way, we are overreacting\u00a0because we are trying to look ahead to see what can go wrong and take preemptive steps to prevent that from happening.\u201d \n Within a week, the taskforce moved from allowing travellers from Wuhan to enter Singapore while subject to enhanced screening on Monday, to imposing a complete entry ban on all nationalities who have been to China in the past 14 days on Friday. \n The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority has also stopped issuing all forms of new visas to those with People\u2019s Republic of China passports. \n HANDLING A PSYCHOLOGICAL CRISIS \n Although the memory of SARS may have faded for some, experts say that the psychological lessons from it have remained until today, such that more Singaporeans are aware of the need to cooperate with the authorities during a health crisis. \n For example, social media is rife with examples of Singaporeans calling out bad actors, such as online sellers who hoard surgical masks to resell, or profiteering behaviour by certain businesses. The Government has also acted quickly to combat such behaviour.\u00a0But Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, believes that the SARS legacy can also be a double-edged sword: The prospect of another SARS-like epidemic might lead to needless panic, or worse, \u201ckiasuism\u201d. \n  \n In a viral outbreak, being\u00a0\u00a0\u201ckiasu\u201d means that people only think for themselves, preventing mutual cooperation from happening, he said. \n Urging Singaporeans to do better, Dr Leong said they should be prepared for the viral outbreak but not overdo it. If fear and panic take hold, they can overwhelm the country\u2019s response \u201clike a tsunami\u201d, he said. \n This means Singapore\u2019s national response has to preemptively address concerns that could lead to panic, he said. \n \u201cYou have no time to get ready. Better to be ready (for the worst) now than not ready at all \u2026 There is little room for mistakes (that create more panic),\u201d said Dr Leong. \n  \n Dr Chia believes that Singaporeans are generally behaving in a rational way so far, based on his conversations with residents as an MP or his interactions with patients. \n \u201cDuring SARS, there was a lot more fear and a sense of real danger for everyone. We had people trying to evade quarantine, refusing to cooperate or going for medical screening \u2026 But so far there are no cases of people who are trying to evade authorities, in other countries, yes, but not among Singaporeans,\u201d he said. \n The rise of social media, which was non-existent during SARS\u00a0, can also give rise to disinformation that fuels further panic. \n On the threat of fake news, SMA\u2019s Dr Tan said: \u201cSocial media may do more harm than good in this kind of situation where fake news may spread faster than a virus and trigger unwanted behaviours. We urge all readers to exercise judgement when reading stories from various sources, and to keep referencing to official websites for accurate information.\u201d \n STRONGER LEGISLATION \n Compared with the SARS\u00a0crisis, Singapore has more legislative levers now to deal with fake news and anti-social behaviour -\u00a0the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act being one of them. \n Lesser known are the many enhancements to the Infectious Diseases Act over the years since 2003, which give the authorities greater powers to enforce orders that were issued in the fight against a gazetted outbreak. \n The Act allows people who break home quarantine orders to be arrested without a warrant and to be jailed or fined on conviction. It was amended last year to allow officers to use \u201cphysical means\u201d to enforce the order by bringing an absconder back to the place of isolation, in lieu of arrest. \n It also makes explicit that persons under legal orders that restrict their movement in Singapore, would not be allowed to leave the country, unless otherwise permitted. \n The breadth of such powers in Singapore gives the authorities the ability to ensure that evasion tactics, such as those described by Dr Chia, cannot happen again. The issue became such a problem during the SARS\u00a0crisis that the health authorities had to resort to draconian measures, such as installing video surveillance cameras in the homes of people who were ordered to be quarantined. \n The lack of legal powers has created some difficulties for several foreign governments in dealing with the Wuhan coronavirus. Earlier this week, two Japanese citizens who were brought back to Japan from Wuhan on a chartered flight declined to go for medical screening when they landed in Tokyo. \n Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told the Japanese Parliament: \"While quarantine officers did their best to persuade them to go for further tests, they refused, and unfortunately there is no legal basis to force them to do so.\" \n MORAL SUASION AND IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC COMMS \n But over the longer term, evidence suggests that government measures such as quarantine and travel restrictions are not as effective as instilling a voluntary sense of social etiquette and responsibility among the people. \n Having a buy-in from the public is especially essential when the authorities need the people\u2019s support to carry out certain measures, noted Prof Pangestu. \n  \n Prof Pangestu said: \u201cYou need the public\u2019s cooperation for your measures to be successful, such as to follow good hygiene practices, be alert to any symptoms, promptly seeking healthcare, awareness of potential risks, and to counter the spread of misinformation on social media.\u201d \n This will be critical during the \u201csurge response\u201d - when situational changes cause a sudden need for the authorities to ramp up its measures, such as activating quarantine sites that are being held in reserve. \n A lack of moral suasion would erase the ability for the Government to implement these measures, experts said. They noted how in Hong Kong, protesters bombed a general hospital and a residential building that the authorities had wanted to use as a possible quarantine facility. \n Over the past week, South Korean protesters -\u00a0mostly residents -\u00a0also used tractors to block access to facilities earmarked as quarantine centres in the cities of Asan and Jincheon, which are about 80km from Seoul. \n Experts said cooperation from the masses largely relies on public education as well as proper and accurate communication of risk, which is not always a guarantee considering the complex flow of information in a crisis situation that can lead to miscommunication. \n An April 2003 article in The Straits Times,\u00a0\"All the right moves for SARSbut info\u2019s a bit slow, no?\",\u00a0by its then\u00a0news editor Bertha Henson, described how the MOH was asked at a press conference to confirm a tipoff that SGH nurses might have SARS. The authorities said no, but it later emerged the next day that 21 SGH staff were on the SARS suspect list. \n \u201cThe kindest thing I can say about this sudden announcement is that the ministry gets its information later than the media,\u201d wrote Ms Henson then. \n Referring to the incident, Professor Chee Yam Cheng, the current president of the Singapore Medical Council, wrote in a series of memos about SARS in 2003 that \u201cquick dissemination of information -\u00a0and accurate information -\u00a0is almost as important as transparency in a health emergency\u201d. \n Prof Pangestu believes that in general, Singaporeans are united and support what the Government is trying to do to contain the situation. \n \u201cBut public reaction is hard to control especially with fake news on social media. The idea that \u2018perception is reality, anything is the truth\u2019 often operates in this kind of (crisis) environment. That is why public risk communication is so important,\u201d he said. \n Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"}, {"content": "Study advances that there is an animal that carries the coronavirus. Know which one. A team of Chinese scientists has shown that pangolins carry coronaviruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2, which causes the current pandemic, but not enough to conclude that they are directly responsible for transmitting the virus to humans. SARS-CoV-2 appeared in a market in Wuhan (China) where wild animals were sold, and although there is evidence to suggest that bats are the reservoir of the syndrome, scientists today still do not know which animal could be the intermediate guest. that facilitated the transmission of the virus to humans. Today, a genomic study led by Chinese virologists Yi Guan of the University of Hong Kong and Yan-Ling Hu of the Guangxi University of Medicine, published in the journal Nature, finds that Malaysian pangolins carry SARS-related coronaviruses. CoV-2. The similarity between these coronaviruses and what caused the pandemic is not enough to confirm that pangolins are the guests that transmitted the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak from bats to humans, but the findings suggest that these wild mammals are &quot;a second a host of coronaviruses,&quot; so the sale in wildlife markets should be strictly prohibited to prevent future transmissions, warn the scientists. In the study, they recall that shortly after the outbreak began, the market in Wuhan - the initial focus of the infection - was dismantled, which prevented the collection of the animal species in which the coronavirus emerged. A possible host could be the pangolin, the most trafficked mammal that is used as food and in traditional Chinese medicine. For the work, Yi Guan and colleagues analyzed samples from 18 Malaysian pangolins seized in anti-smuggling operations in southern China between August 2017 and January 2018, and in all they found different types of coronaviruses. Viruses from these samples had an 85% to 92% genetic similarity to SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, in one of these viruses, the region that facilitates entry into the cell is very similar to that of the current virus. However, none of the pangolin coronaviruses had the specific alteration of human SARS-CoV-2, which raises doubts that pangolins are directly responsible for the transmission of the coronavirus to humans. Still, the study authors warn that pangolins should not be sold in markets and propose greater surveillance of these animals to understand their role in the emergence of coronaviruses with the potential to infect humans. The new coronavirus, responsible for the covid-19 pandemic, has already infected over 480,000 people worldwide, of which about 22,000 have died. After appearing in China in December, the outbreak spread across the world, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a pandemic situation. The European continent, with almost 260,000 infected, is where the highest number of cases is currently appearing. Italy is the country with the most fatalities in the world - with 7,503 dead, out of 74,386 recorded cases as of Wednesday. Spain is the second country with the highest number of deaths, registering 4,089, out of 56,188 confirmed cases of infection to date. China, not counting the territories of Hong Kong and Macau, has 81,285 cases (more than 74,000 recovered) and records 3,287 deaths. In the last 24 hours, it reported six deaths and 67 new cases, all originating abroad, as the country begins to return to normality, after two months of stoppage. In Portugal, there were 60 deaths, 17 more than on Wednesday (+39.5%), and 3,544 confirmed infections, according to the assessment made today by the General Directorate of Health, which identified 549 new cases in relation to Wednesday (+18.3%).

I told them not to worry because Singapore has the situation under control, implementing effective quarantine measures,\u201d Mr Jafari, who has been a Singapore citizen for more than\u00a015 years, said. \n Ms Hayedeh remains worried about her friends and family who are avoiding social gatherings and staying home, but she refrains from calling them \u201cmore than usual\u201d because\u00a0she does not want to \u201cgive them stress or anxiety.\u201d \n A sense of excitement that\u00a0should\u00a0be felt with the Iranian New Year, or Nowruz, being just around the corner on March 20, is replaced by largely empty roads and even emptier stores there. \n Ms Hayedeh said: \u201cNo one has the mood to go out to shop. Like Chinese New Year, before Nowruz, everybody goes out to shop, buy new clothes, food, sweets and house decorations. Businesses are very affected.\u201d \n Researcher Alireza Javadian, 34, who is here on an employment pass, said: \u201cMany travel agencies that sold tour packages to visitors hoping to go to Iran\u00a0to celebrate the new year received a lot of cancellations.\u201d \n  \n Mr Alireza Javadian, an Iranian who is a researcher on an employment pass in Singapore, during a visit to Cambodia.

She also said\u00a0that living here made her realise \"how ready Singapore is to fight and protect its people\u201d. \n She used to work as a flight\u00a0cabin crew and\u00a0is moving to the banking field. \n \u201cI\u2019m very sure the government in South Korea also did the best it\u00a0could\u00a0to contain the virus but it was already spreading so quickly,\u201d she said. \n \u201cThe official in charge of managing Covid-19 even commited suicide. It just shows how troubled the official was.\u201d \n She added: \u201cI feel really worried and sad for my people in (South Korea). I hope things will get better soon.\u201d \n Two weeks ago, a South Korean undergraduate, Ms Eunbin Cho, 22, had to cancel her flight to Seoul on March 11 to visit her family there but could not obtain a refund because\u00a0there were no official travel restrictions at that time. \n She said that she is worried about her family being there as the number of infections keep going up. \n \u201cToday I saw that there were five new cases at the exact location where my grandparents and parents are living, in Gangnam (a district in Seoul). It\u2019s so bad,\u201d she told TODAY on Monday. \u201cThere are\u00a0confirmed cases everywhere.\u201d \n Ms Cho said that\u00a0she is deeply saddened by the situation in South Korea and was upset to see comments on Facebook making jokes about it. \n On a\u00a0Facebook page of a Singapore media outlet, she found\u00a0comments that were \"very bad\", trying to be funny and saying things such as \"Train to Daegu\", an apparent reference to Train to Busan, a Korean zombie film. \n \u201cBut it\u2019s not funny at all,\u201d she said. \u201cThey keep making fun of it by saying it\u2019s like a Korean drama. It\u2019s quite hurtful for me to read it because they\u2019re taking it as a joke.\u201d \n Television producer Christine Park, 25, a Singapore permanent resident, said that more people are avoiding crowded places in Seoul. \n \u201cMy relatives are scared, they won't leave the house much and won\u2019t eat out. My cousin in fourth grade usually has piano, taekwondo classes but is not going to go for them anymore.\u201d \n 'BUSINESSES CLOSING EARLY IN ITALY' \n Writer Edoardo Liotta, 23, who has been in Singapore since he was a year old, said that he was worried about his family in Italy. \n Most of Mr Liotta\u2019s family members live\u00a0in Rome, but his cousin lives in Milan which is a major hotspot for Covid-19. \n \u201cI text my cousin in Milan more often because she is much closer to the outbreak areas. She has had to work from home and all big gatherings have been cancelled,\u201d Mr Liotta said. \n He added that the situation is being handled well by the Italian authorities. \n \u201cGenerally, I think the (Italian government) is doing really well considering they did the most tests compared to any other European country,\u201d he said. \n \u201cThey were fast to lock down towns that had outbreaks. The city of Milan has been quite empty to reduce transmission and there are roadblocks and many other efforts in place.\u201d \n Another Italian on an employment pass who wants to be known only as Mr Francesco, 28, subscribes to the Gov.sg WhatsApp channel and thinks that direct channels of information are a good way to help the Singapore Government coordinate communication to the public. \n \u201cThe channel helps people to understand the situation better which helps reduce panic,\u201d he said, adding that officials in Italy disseminate information only through the media. \n Friends and relatives in Italy tell him that some businesses are closing earlier there as the Covid-19 crisis deepens. \n \u201cSome bars are closed after 6pm to avoid crowds, so are theatres and clubs,\u201d he said, adding that restaurants have not closed because only crowded places will be closed in the evening. \n Mr Alan Serrecchia, 40, a sales manager on an employment pass here, also said that the Italian government is managing the outbreak well but he hopes that this\u00a0health crisis\u00a0will all end quickly. \n \u201cI hope that it will be over soon for everyone,\u201d he added \u201cAnd I hope that we can endure this situation.\u201d"}, {"content": "A nurse accuses China of lying and guarantees that there are already 90,000 infected with coronaviruses.

The new coronavirus could infect at least one in 20 people in the city of Wuhan, China, when it peaks in the coming weeks, according to the prediction of scientists who have established models for the virus&#39;s spread. The trend supported in the cases reported in Wuhan &quot;largely supports&quot; the mathematical models that the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical is using to predict the transmission of the dynamic epidemic, according to scientists at the institution, cited Sunday by the financial information agency Bloomberg . &quot;Assuming current trends continue, we are projecting a peak in mid-to-late February&quot; in Wuhan, said associate professor of infectious disease epidemiology Adam Kucharski at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical, quoted by Bloomberg. Kucharski, who works with mathematical analysis of infectious disease outbreaks, explained that &quot;there is a lot of uncertainty, so be cautious about choosing a single peak value, but it is possible, based on current data, to see a prevalence peak above 5%&quot;. Wuhan, the Chinese city where the 2019-nCoV virus emerged late last year, has been quarantined since Jan. 23, with 11 million people restricted from moving. Health authorities in China and around the world are eager to know whether the largest known quarantine in the world is effective in containing pneumonia caused by the new virus in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province, where they live 60 millions of people. Mapping the worldwide coronavirus outbreak, Kucharski, as well as his colleagues at the British institution, based their models on a set of hypotheses about the 2019-nCoV virus. These include an incubation period of 5.2 days, delay in symptom onset to confirm infection of 6.1 days and the risk of infection among the 10 million people who have been identified as the most vulnerable in Wuhan. Based on those data, a prevalence of 5% equates to around 500,000 infections in total. This is many times more than the 14,982 cases that provincial health officials had reported in Wuhan by 8:00 pm on Saturday night in China. &quot;The next two weeks are really critical to understanding what&#39;s going on,&quot; said Benjamin Cowling, head of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Hong Kong, in an interview in Melbourne on Thursday, quoted by Bloomberg. . They will also be critical, he warned, to know &quot;whether the virus is spreading to other places or whether we have avoided what could be a global pandemic because of the control measures adopted and implemented so far.&quot; The number of deaths resulting from the outbreak of pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) amounts to 813, of which 811 in mainland China, where the number of infected exceeds 37,000. In the 24 hours before the balance made this Sunday, Chinese authorities recorded 89 deaths on the mainland and 2,656 new cases of infection with the coronavirus detected in December, in Wuhan, capital of Hubei province (centre), placed under quarantine. The new balance already exceeds that of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which between 2002 and 2003 caused the death of 774 people worldwide, most of them in China, but the mortality rate remains lower . So far, the only two deaths from the new coronavirus recorded outside mainland China have been in the Philippines and Hong Kong. In addition to mainland China and the Chinese regions of Macau and Hong Kong, there are more than 350 confirmed cases of contagion in 25 countries. In Europe, the number reached 39 on Sunday, with two new infections detected in Spain and the UK.

In a more disastrous scenario, the death toll could reach 68 million, including hundreds of thousands of deaths in Great Britain and the United States of America. In the event of a pandemic, the economy of some countries could shrink by up to 8% in a global meltdown. The researchers who published the study, Warwick McKibbon and Roshen Fernando, warn that even a contained boom can significantly affect the global economy in a short period of time. In a less severe scenario, the mortality rate in China is estimated to reach 2%. The global mortality rate has reached increasingly higher values \u200b\u200band currently hovers around 3.4%.

Estimates indicate that India and China will lose millions of people, and that in the United States around 23,000 deaths will be registered. The researchers also note that the estimated deaths from coronaviruses can compare with a regular flu season in the United States, as about 55,000 people die each year. In the case of Great Britain, 64,000 deaths are expected. In Germany 79,000 and in France 60,000. South Korea and Italy, which in recent weeks have been experiencing particularly widespread outbreaks, could also be affected with tens of thousands of deaths.

In a more serious scenario, the coronavirus outbreak could cause a catastrophic death toll with more than 68 million. In China, the number of deaths could reach 12 million people, and in the US, 1.1 million. The death toll in Britain would reach 290,000, with France and Germany also losing thousands. Data from investigators show that the death toll in Russia could also reach a million. In this disastrous scenario, the global economy could fall by 9.2 trillion dollars.

The stakes are higher now that the virus has started spreading from human to human. \n All patients at emergency departments are screened, and those with fever and travel history are isolated. All general practice doctors have also been told what to look out for and given a number to call if there are any suspected patients. \n Any such call from a doctor will activate a special ambulance which will transport the suspected patient, aged above 16, straight to the NCID.

The ambulance will then be cleaned before it is used again. \n At the NCID, the patients will be placed in special negative-pressure isolation rooms, where air flows only into the rooms, not out of them. \n The air in the rooms is sucked out through high-efficiency particulate air, or Hepa, filters. \n Prof Leo said the NCID has \"high-end\" Hepa filters in 124 negative-pressure isolation rooms which clean 99.999 per cent of contaminants, including viruses. \n As an extra precaution, even after it has gone through the filters, the air is further cleaned with ultraviolet rays. \n It will take the laboratory between four and eight hours to determine if the patient is infected with a coronavirus. If that test proves positive, genetic sequencing will be done to confirm that it is the new bug. That takes 24 hours. \n Prof Leo said there are a lot of coronaviruses but only seven, including this new one, that spread from human to human. \n Four types cause the common cold and are mild. The other two are the more dangerous Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome). \n A negative-pressure isolation room at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases.

NEW YORK (BLOOMBERG) - The drug touted by United States President Donald Trump as a possible line of treatment against the coronavirus comes with severe warnings in China and can kill in dosages as small as 2g. \n China, where the deadly pathogen first emerged in December, recommended the decades-old malaria drug chloroquine to treat infected patients in guidelines issued in February after seeing encouraging results in clinical trials. But within days, it cautioned doctors and health officials about the drug's lethal side effects and rolled back its usage. \n This came after local media reported that a Wuhan Institute of Virology study found that the drug can kill an adult dosed at just twice the daily amount recommended for treatment, which is 1g. \n As the drug has not been approved by the US Food And Drug Administration to treat the disease known as Covid-19, the Chinese experience may be useful as the American regulator studies the medication which has been endorsed by Mr Trump as well as Tesla\u00a0chief executive officer Elon Musk. \n The pandemic, which has sickened more than 235,000 globally and killed over 9,800 people, has triggered growing anxiety across the US as states say they lack testing kits and medical equipment. California instituted a statewide lockdown on Thursday (March 19) to slow the outbreak. \n Chloroquine was among the first group of therapies Chinese scientists identified as being effective in curbing the new coronavirus. Clinical trials on about 130 patients demonstrated the drug's ability to reduce the severity of the illness and speed up virus clearance, according to China's Ministry of Sciences and Technology. \n Chloroquine phosphate was officially recommended on Feb 19 in the Covid-19 treatment guidelines published by China's National Health Commission, along with a few other drugs such as AbbVie Inc's Kaletra and flu drug arbidol as antiviral treatments for patients. The commission recommended no more than a 10-day course of chloroquine for adult patients at 500mg - half a gram - twice a day. \n As hundreds of clinical trials are launched to study potential Covid-19 treatments, stocks of drugmakers and biotechnology companies have racked up big gains on the hope that the industry will see a windfall. But the history of previous viral outbreaks like Ebola and Zika show little success in producing viable treatments. Some potential drugs were developed only after the epidemics already waned through containment measures. \n China's recommendation to use chloroquine in treatment was quickly followed by a warning. \n Two days after the treatment guideline update, the health authorities in Hubei province - China's worst-hit region, where the outbreak started and which accounted for the majority of its over 80,000 patients - asked hospitals to closely watch for, and immediately report, any adverse side effects of chloroquine phosphate, according to a report in local media outlet The Paper. \n The drug is known to have short-term side effects such as nausea, diarrhoea and tinnitus, while long-term use can irreversibly impair eyesight. It is forbidden for pregnant women, as it can cause congenital defects in babies. \n The China Health Commission revised the dosage in a Feb 29 notice tightening chloroquine use. The drug cannot be given to pregnant women, those with heart disease, terminal liver and renal disease, retina and hearing loss and patients on antibiotics such as azithromycin and steroid. \n It can now be given only to patients between 18 and\u00a065 years of age for a seven-day treatment course. Patients weighing over 50kg can take 500mg twice a day - the usual dose - while those weighing less will be administered the drug just once a day after two days of use, according to the latest guidelines."}, {"content": "The restrictions that travelers now face. As of Monday, the Federal Ministry of the Interior (BMI) ordered temporary border controls. These will take place at the internal borders with Austria, Switzerland, France, Luxembourg and Denmark. German citizens, persons with residence status and first place of residence in Germany are still allowed to enter Germany. Returning travelers from Italy, Austria and Switzerland are asked to stay at home for 14 days after their return. This applies regardless of whether there is a specific suspected corona case or not. New guidelines for border controls are intended to ensure the free movement of goods in the European internal market. The cross-border movement of goods and commuters is therefore guaranteed. The latter are asked to have proof of their activity with them. Travelers &quot;without a valid reason for travel&quot; are no longer allowed to enter or leave the above-mentioned borders. In individual cases, a personal reason can also be considered &quot;valid&quot;. It is at the discretion of the border police which cross-border private travel they allow. According to the BMI, the officers of the Federal Police are experienced in assessing such individual cases, as this is their daily business. In addition to Germany and many other countries, the European Union will also close all of its external borders from today. Travel between EU countries and other countries will be suspended for 30 days. The measure should apply from Tuesday noon. According to the EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, there should be exceptions for citizens with permanent residence permits for the EU. Also for relatives of EU citizens, diplomats, doctors, nurses, researchers and experts. And also for people who transport important goods and commuters who work in the EU. The federal and state governments want to drastically restrict tourism in Germany. On Monday, the federal government decreed that overnight offers such as hotels or hostels in Germany &quot;can only be used for necessary and expressly not for tourist purposes&quot;. In the evening, Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a speech &quot;that there should be no vacation trips at home or abroad&quot;. The Robert Koch Institute currently counts the following countries or areas as risk areas: Italy, Iran, in China: Province of Hubei, in South Korea: Province of Gyeongsangbuk-do, in France: Region Grand Est (including Alsace, Lorraine and Champagne-Ardenne) , in Austria: the state of Tyrol, in Spain: Madrid, in the USA: the states of California, Washington and New York. The more important question right now is: Should I still travel at all? The federal government&#39;s crisis team gives a clear answer by advising against all unnecessary trips abroad. The reason: Because of the measures taken against the corona virus, the risk of travelers not being able to return to Germany without further ado increases. In addition, further drastic restrictions on air and travel traffic can be expected in the short term, writes the Federal Foreign Office. To slow the spread of the new virus, many governments around the world have imposed entry restrictions. For example, Poland has closed its borders to foreigners, and international flight and train connections have been suspended. The US has banned all entries from Europe for a period of 30 days. The entry ban for Europeans applies if they have stayed in Germany or another country in the Schengen area within a period of 14 days before entering the USA. Other countries, such as Russia or Romania, oblige travelers from Germany to a 14-day quarantine. Other countries, including India, have declared all visas that have already been issued for German citizens to be invalid. For Thailand, on the other hand, there is (still) no hard entry stop. The entry requirements of your country of travel can currently change spontaneously. You should therefore find out more information at short notice, for example from the Foreign Office, the respective national representation in Germany or the German embassy in your country of travel. It is also advisable to always find out about the current status of booked flights with the airlines. This is not regulated uniformly. The contracts of some providers include a pandemic exclusion. This means that the insurance does not have to pay if a customer becomes infected with the pathogen in question during a pandemic. Some providers refrain from this option out of goodwill. Insurers are currently examining whether their protection continues to apply when customers travel to a country that has been classified as a risk area by the Robert Koch Institute. The validity of some foreign health insurances could be restricted accordingly. Many insurers now publish FAQs with further information on their website. Foreign Minister Heiko Maas (SPD) has launched a return campaign for thousands of Germans who are stuck abroad due to travel restrictions in the corona crisis. Most Germans, around 4,000 to 5,000 people, are in Morocco, according to the Foreign Office. The Bundeswehr is currently not being used for the repatriations, as enough aircraft from Lufthansa, for example, are available. These would be used on behalf of the government. The Federal Foreign Office has formally issued a worldwide travel warning for tourist trips. At Deutsche Bahn, tickets can be exchanged for vouchers - even if they are so-called saver prices or super saver prices. There is no fee for this. This applies to tickets bought before March 13th and for which the travel day is between March 13th and April 30th. The railway has created an online form for this. The application will be accepted even after the day of travel. Another option is to use these tickets flexibly on another day until June 30th. The train connection is canceled. Only city tickets are then no longer valid. The German market leader Flixbus will cease operations on Wednesday. The company announced in Munich. All national and cross-border connections to and from Germany are affected. Affected passengers would be informed about the bus cancellations, it said. You would get a voucher for the entire ticket price. The Blablabus company will also cease operations on Wednesday morning. On Monday last week, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte declared all of Italy a restricted area. This means that travel within the country is generally prohibited - but exceptions are possible. Just like the measures previously imposed for northern Italy, the restrictions are initially to apply until April 3. Conte stated: &quot;Our habits have to change, now. We all have to give up something for the good of Italy.&quot; All shops except supermarkets and pharmacies have been closed since Thursday. This also includes bars and restaurants as well as theaters and museums. The federal government advises against all unnecessary trips to Italy - after the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) classified the whole country as a risk area. The Federal Foreign Office has meanwhile updated its travel advice. Previously, the information only applied to particularly badly affected regions in the north of the country. The Federal Foreign Office points out that it is currently still possible to return to a place of residence both inside and outside Italy. However, checks and inquiries from security and law enforcement officers must be expected. A self-declaration about the need to travel within the country must be completed and carried with you. Unfortunately, there is currently no general answer for all travelers. Contact your tour operator as early as possible. There you will find information about what you can do if you have booked a holiday in countries with travel restrictions. Cancellation free of charge is usually possible if the Federal Foreign Office has issued a travel warning. With regard to the new corona virus, such a warning so far only applies to the Chinese province of Hubei. You can often withdraw from your booking if you have to reckon with significant changes to your planned trip, writes the consumer advice center. This applies not only to entry bans, but also, in case of doubt, when essential sights cannot be visited. Individual travelers should contact the airlines, train or bus companies directly and the accommodations that have already been reserved or the booking portals used. &quot;If there is a concrete risk due to extraordinary circumstances, you can cancel free of charge,&quot; says Hamburg lawyer Oliver Matzek, a specialist in travel law. Severe weather or strikes, but also medical emergencies such as an epidemic, are recognized as extraordinary circumstances. In order to find out whether such an exceptional circumstance is a possible reason for cancellation for your travel destination, it is best to ask your contractual partner directly. Anyone who, for fear of infection, wants to cancel a trip that has already been booked without specific travel restrictions in place, can at any time refer to the cancellation rules that were agreed upon when the contract was concluded, regardless of the coronavirus. If you do not cancel your trip yourself, but the airline cancels your connection, for example, your ticket price will usually be fully reimbursed. The same applies if an entire package tour is canceled. Most travel cancellation insurances only cover illness before the start of the trip, not the risk of possible infection during the trip. You can find the exact provisions in the contract conditions of your insurance company. In principle, you can take out insurance at any time before the first day of your trip, but with one decisive restriction: &quot;At the time the contract is concluded, the insured event must not have occurred,&quot; explains lawyer Matzek. Existing risks cannot be insured. This also applies to the corona epidemic, which is particularly important if you are traveling to regions that have already been classified as risk areas. Returning travelers from Italy, Austria and Switzerland are asked to stay at home for 14 days after their return. This applies regardless of whether there is a specific suspected corona case or not. Anyone who develops symptoms typical of the new coronavirus within 14 days of returning from a risk area should call the medical on-call service, which can be reached nationwide at 116117. Typical symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath, but the Covid-19 disease caused by the coronavirus can develop very differently according to the RKI. If you suspect that you may have been infected, stay at home and do not visit a doctor&#39;s practice or emergency room on your own, so if in doubt, you run the risk of infecting other people. Since there are no reliable predictions about how the coronavirus epidemic will develop, this question cannot be easily answered at the moment. Many tour operators pause their program until the end of April (initially) and relax their cancellation rules.

When Germans go to Switzerland for a ski holiday in the near future, the gondolas and luxury shops will be emptier than usual. Because the Chinese tourist groups, which have recently become more and more dominant in the streets, stay away. The coronavirus is to blame. Many flights to and from China are currently canceled, two thirds of the overnight stays by Chinese in Europe have been canceled, estimates the European tourism association Etoa. What the skiers may be happy about is provided by the hoteliers and boutique operators. Because the Chinese are not only a steadily growing travel group, they are also a little stingy: In Switzerland, for example, they spend almost three times as much each night as German guests. Countries with a lot of tourism are therefore the first to have their economies hit by the coronavirus. But they won&#39;t be the only ones. The virus has become a threat to the global economy. You can already see that in the reactions of the stock markets. The courses went down not only in China after the New Year celebrations there. The Shanghai Composite Index was down nine percent on Monday. And when the Chinese stock exchanges were closed the week before, the international markets were already reacting. The German share index Dax fell significantly last week on Monday, then recovered slightly, only to fall again on Thursday. Overall, he lost 4.4 percent in the week. The Dow Jones in the United States fell 3.5 percent in the same week. Oil and copper, whose prices always react quickly when the world economy is in danger, also fell significantly. Investors tend to exaggerate, but they do a pretty good job of what is currently expected for the future. And the expectation these days is: be careful, this virus could be contagious. Contagious to the global economy. This is mainly because it broke out in China, a country that is highly intertwined with the rest of the world. For example, about raw materials: 13.5 percent of the world&#39;s crude oil and almost half of the crude steel went there last year. In 2002 the respective proportion was only around half as high. In terms of consumption, too, China has gained importance that should not be underestimated. Almost every third smartphone is sold in China today and more than every third car. The more intertwined other countries are with China and the global economy, the more vulnerable they are if the virus paralyzes the Chinese economy for a longer period of time. Germany is enormously globalized, as shown, among other things, by the export surplus, which was recently higher than in any other country in the world. The third most important export country is China. At the same time it is the most important import country. As far as individual sectors are concerned, the German auto industry in particular is strongly tied to China. BMW, Daimler and Co. sell around every third car there, and at Volkswagen it is as much as 40 percent. So the dependency is great. But can the virus really do so much that it affects the entire German economy? It can harm the global economy in three ways. First, very directly. Since many people have stayed at home because of the health hazard, since shops have been closed, gyms, restaurants and sometimes entire factories, China&#39;s domestic economy has almost come to a standstill for a short time. Foreign companies are feeling this. Either because they are selling less in China or because Chinese tourists are canceling. Or if they produce in China themselves because production fails. This can quickly be over when the contagion has reached its peak. Second, the virus can damage the global economy through Chinese growth. If the epidemic lasts longer and if it lowers growth over a longer period of time, this has an indirect effect on countries that are connected to China. Because as a result, companies invest less in China. And countries that produce capital goods - Germany is strong here - will be hit. At the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organization WHO an accumulation of pneumonia of unknown cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Just a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days later, a group led by virologist Christian Drosten from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers are provisionally calling 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. The Chinese authorities suspect the source of the pathogen to be a food market in Wuhan, where not only fish and seafood but also exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected. Both Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic in 2002 and 2003, around 8,000 people were infected and more than 750 died. Between its discovery in 2012 and the end of 2019, around 2,500 people were infected with the Mers virus, and every third person died from it. In total, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example. Several thousand people have now become ill in China, some of them - most of them probably with previous illnesses - died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first cases of infection outside of China became known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been to Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who was returning from Wuhan, and on January 24, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia, which can be fatal. Since it is a viral disease, antibiotics won&#39;t help. It is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after a dozen or so cases among medical personnel became known. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. As it announced on January 24, the World Health Organization currently expects that an infected person will infect an average of 1.4 to 2.5 other people. If these numbers prove to be true, the virus is less contagious than Sars and so is the flu. The WHO recommends following general hygiene rules: You should wash your hands often and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals. It is not yet possible to say with certainty. The World Health Organization announced on January 28th that around a fifth of the reported cases would become seriously ill from the virus, so if in doubt they would have to be treated in intensive care. According to reports, the first fatalities were patients, some of whom had serious previous illnesses. People with previous illnesses are also particularly at risk from other infectious diseases - such as the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, i.e. change their genetic makeup. That can make them more dangerous to people in the course of an outbreak - but also the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate that is as high as that of the Sars outbreak. The third way is the most unlikely, but most dangerous: a panic. If the epidemic develops so dramatically in China or even worldwide that investor confidence falls and prices crash worldwide, this can lead to a financial crisis. This is currently also being debated because many economists regard the global economy as fragile anyway. The American Kenneth Rogoff, for example, has long been warning that the risks of another financial crisis are increasing worldwide. In January, prominent economists discussed possible triggers at the American Economic Association&#39;s annual meeting. The virus was not an issue back then, but China was. The country is under observation because it has grown rapidly for years, but has now been weak for a long time. From the point of view of some observers, the real estate boom has taken on a dangerous dimension, as has debt. Sometimes it just takes one trigger for the whole situation to overturn. Especially since the central banks around the world are no longer as strong as they used to be since they fired a lot of powder in the financial crisis. But can a virus really be a trigger for such a dramatic crisis? A look back could be cause for the all-clear. The outbreak of the infectious disease Sars in 2003, the tsunami in Thailand and Indonesia (2004, 230,000 fatalities) or the reactor disaster in Fukushima (2011) had economically limited consequences. Just a few quarters after the disaster, the economy was back in full swing. But the comparison with these events has its pitfalls. Natural disasters, in which houses, factories and streets are destroyed, often lead to a special growth phase after a short time. Simply because the damage is being repaired. Such a special boom is not to be expected after a wave of illnesses. Because there are no houses or roads to build. The parallels with the Sars epidemic are also limited. &quot;One should not make the mistake of orienting oneself without reflection on this crisis,&quot; says Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank. At that time, prices were rising again just as the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency. Yes, according to de la Rubia, they even started an &quot;amazing rally&quot;. First, however, the health consequences are different. Even now, after a few weeks, China is counting more deaths from the new pathogen than during the entire Sars outbreak, which lasted several months. Second, the economic conditions are fundamentally different. In 2003 China was a rising economic power, but its importance for world trade was even less than it is today. 17 years ago, less than five percent of global economic output came from Chinese goods and services; today it is 19 percent. China has also become more important as a buyer of exports. An economic slump in China should therefore be felt more strongly internationally than in the past. Timo Wollmersh\u00e4user tries to estimate exactly how much the German economy could suffer. He heads the economic department of the Ifo Institute in Munich. To do this, he uses a software program with hundreds of equations containing data on economic interdependencies and previously observed interactions: the Ifo economic model. Wollmersh\u00e4user entered the data for a scenario in which China&#39;s economic output declines by one percent into this program. That was how strong the decline was caused by Sars. The economic consequences that the corona virus would have for Germany would therefore be manageable: In this case, growth in this country would only decrease by 0.05 percent. &quot;If the current epidemic dampens Chinese economic growth twice as much as it did at Sars, it should be around 0.1 percent lower in Germany.&quot; The consequences would be stronger than before, but not a drama for the entire economy. The effects could be so minor because an epidemic initially dampens consumer demand: travel, dining out, shopping. Much of it is now being dropped and will not be made up for. &quot;For Germany, however, it is practically irrelevant if consumption in China falls,&quot; says Wollmersh\u00e4user. &quot;We hardly deliver any consumer goods there.&quot; Only if the Chinese order fewer machines and fewer cars - the second way in which the virus can damage the economy - that would be noticeable for local exports. Often, however, such large purchases are only postponed in a crisis and made up later. The consequences could be more serious if the supply chains are disrupted. So if China fails longer as a supplier of products for the local industry. German companies purchase around a tenth of all primary products and capital goods imported from abroad from China. However, it is not yet clear to what extent delivery bottlenecks will actually arise. This is also difficult to say because even experts in China find it difficult to assess the economic consequences. Streets and shops are now empty not only in Wuhan, where the infection began, but also in other major cities. Many companies have still closed their offices - partly by order of the local authorities, partly on the basis of their own decision. In some regions, such as Shanghai, workers are supposed to stay at home until February 9, in others, such as Beijing, the officially extended holiday season ended earlier this week. &quot;It will probably not be possible to foresee until the beginning of next week to what extent the workforce in the companies will be able to work again and to what extent there will be problems in the supply chains,&quot; says Jens Hildebrandt, Managing Director of the German Chamber of Commerce in Beijing. Hildebrandt himself currently works from home. In addition, most forecasts are still based on the assumption that the new virus will cause a regional and temporary crisis. If this does not come true, if the standstill in China lasts longer or if Germany is more severely affected by the virus, then the economic damage is much more difficult to predict.

And he suspended all travel from Europe, with a few exceptions, to the United States for 30 days starting on Friday.\nEarlier, Trump signed a $8.3 billion emergency spending bill to combat the spread of the virus and develop vaccines for the highly contagious disease.\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve has cut interest rates by half a percentage point in its first emergency rate move since the height of the 2008 financial crisis. Investors expect more cuts in the weeks ahead.\nCHINA\nChina said it had earmarked 110.5 billion yuan ($15.9 billion) to fight the epidemic.\nBeijing has ramped up funding support for virus-hit regions and the country's central bank has cut several of its key rates, including the benchmark lending rate, and has urged banks to give cheap loans and payment relief to exposed companies.\nChina will modify the environmental supervision of companies to help the resumption of production disrupted by the coronavirus epidemic, giving firms more time to rectify environmental problems.\nJAPAN\nJapan unveiled a second package of measures worth about $4 billion in spending to cope with the fallout of the coronavirus outbreak, focusing on support to small and mid-sized firms, as concerns mount about risks to the fragile economy.\nSeparately, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has pledged to pump more liquidity into markets and step up asset buying.\nJapan's central bank may also take steps to ensure companies hit by the coronavirus outbreak do not face a financial squeeze before the end of the current fiscal year in March, according to sources familiar with the central bank's thinking.\nEUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK\nThe ECB, the central bank of the euro zone, has so far avoided cutting interest rates. Policymakers did hold an unscheduled meeting on March 3 but it was to discuss operational responses to coronavirus, such as whether to hold events and staff shortages, rather than any policy response, sources close to the matter said.\nThe ECB has asked euro zone banks to review their business continuity plans and the actions they can take to prepare for and minimize the potential adverse effects of the coronavirus, a letter seen by Reuters shows.\nTHE EUROPEAN UNION\nEuropean Union leaders have so far failed to agree radical measures to tackle the crisis.

BEIJING (AP) \u2014 Scientists in the city at the centre of China\u2019s virus outbreak have applied to patent a drug made by United States (US) company Gilead Science Inc to treat the disease, possibly fuelling conflict over technology policy that helped trigger Washington\u2019s tariff war with Beijing.The government-run Wuhan Institute of Virology said this week it applied for the patent in January along with a military laboratory. An institute statement acknowledged there are \u201cintellectual property barriers\u201d but said it acted to \u201cprotect national interests\u201d.Granting its own scientists a patent might give the Chinese government leverage in negotiations over paying for the drug. But it also might fuel complaints Beijing abuses its regulatory system to pressure foreign companies to hand over valuable technology.Yesterday, the official Xinhua News Agency said clinical trials of the drug, remdesivir, were due to start.Gilead, headquartered in Foster City, California, said it applied in 2016 for a Chinese patent on use of remdesivir against coronaviruses and is waiting for a decision. The coronavirus family includes the novel coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV, blamed for the outbreak in Wuhan.\u201cGilead has no influence over whether a patent office issues a patent to the Chinese researchers,\u201d said a company spokesman, Ryan McKeel. \u201cTheir application has been filed more than three years after Gilead\u2019s filing and will be considered in view of what is already known about the compound and pending patent applications.\u201dThe institute said its application was filed on January 21. Two days later, Chinese authorities suspended most access to Wuhan, a city of 11 million people. That lockdown has expanded to surrounding cities and some in other provinces, isolating a total of about 60 million people in the most sweeping anti-disease measures ever imposed.China has the right under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules to declare an emergency and compel a company to licence a patent to protect the public.It would be required to pay a license fee that is deemed fair market value.The government might be able to avoid that fee if the patent were granted to the Wuhan institute, part of the elite Chinese Academy of Sciences.The institute said it applied for a \u201cuse patent\u201d that specifies the Wuhan virus as the drug\u2019s target. Gilead\u2019s patent application, filed before the virus was identified, cites only the overall family of coronaviruses.The Chinese researchers made their patent application \u201cfrom the perspective of protecting national interests,\u201d said the institute\u2019s statement.\u201cIf relevant foreign companies plan to contribute to China\u2019s epidemic prevention and control, we both agree that if the state needs it, we will not require enforcement of rights given by the patent,\u201d it said.Gilead said last week it was working with US and Chinese health authorities on studying remdesivir. The company said it has provided the drug for emergency use in a small number of patients with the Wuhan virus \u201cin the absence of any approved treatment options\u201d."}, {"content": "First case of Malaysian positive for coronavirus.

By Mohd Fharkhan Abdul GhaparKUALA LUMPUR, Jan 30\u00a0 -- Malaysia has been more prepared and proactive, and has also acted faster in containing the novel coronavirus compared to previous times when faced with dangerous infections such as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory\u00a0Syndrome), the Nipah virus and Ebola.Infectious disease specialist Datuk Dr\u00a0Christopher\u00a0K.C.\u00a0Lee told Bernama yesterday that its experience in containing these past infectious diseases had made Malaysia more prepared to deal with such situations, and this included having more thermal scanners which have been placed at all entry points into the country, as well as its actions in isolating coronavirus cases and placing suspected cases under quarantine.He said swift measures such as these were important in reducing potential local transmissions of the virus in the country.\"Compared to SARS in 2002, when we took weeks to trace the infections, now we have managed to do so much earlier due to our experience, expertise and the technology employed.\"We are now in a containment phase, to prevent any local transmission. The seven cases that have been detected were not infected in Malaysia but overseas, and imported into the country. It is important that we prevent the infections from spreading within the country,\" Dr Lee explained.The new coronavirus, named 2019-nCoV, was first detected in December, in Wuhan, China, causing pneumonia and symptoms such as fever, cough and breathing difficulties. As of last night, Malaysia had seven confirmed cases.The specialist added that apart from thermal scanners, the dissemination of information to every tourist entering Malaysia, particularly tourists from infected areas, was also important.\"They (tourists) need to be given information about the virus and actions needed such as seeking\u00a0treatment at specific hospitals if they do not feel well.\"This is important because when they entered Malaysia, they may not have had a fever or other symptoms but may have fallen ill several days later,\" Dr Lee stressed.The specialist who is experienced in handling SARS, Nipah virus and\u00a0Ebola cases, noted that the outbreak of the virus in affected areas such as Wuhan, had occurred at a faster rate compared to other infectious diseases, and the world still had insufficient data on the new virus.The spread of the virus had been exacerbated by the increased movement of people within\u00a0and out of China\u00a0in conjunction with the Chinese New Year celebrations.\u00a0\u201cIt\u00a0makes things a bit complicated,\u201d he said.Asked about claims that the coronavirus could be spread through its presence on the surface of goods imported from China, Dr Lee said the possibility of such an occurrence was low because many viruses could only last within a particular environment for a period ranging from a few hours to a few days, and this would be dependent on the context.\"Although we do not have enough information on the coronavirus, we believe it is like SARS and influenza which\u00a0won\u2019t last long in the environment,\" he added.\u00a0-- BERNAMA\u00a0"}, {"content": "Coronavirus India cases and deaths: Best or worst, this online epidemic calculator shows Covid-19 projections. What is going to be the future of Covid-19 in India? For how long coronavirus will infect people here? How many people are going to fall sick with Covid-19 in India? And how many people may die of Covid-19 here? No one has a sure answer to these questions. Possibly because no one can have an answer to these questions. But in case you are curious there is an online tool created by a machine learning expert that shows the course Covid-19 pandemic may take in India. It is a simple tool, but one based on SEIR model that scientists and public health experts use to predict epidemic in a given region.\nThe tool has been created by Gabriel Goh, a machine learning researcher.\nThere is nothing official about the tool but during a time when the information from government experts may not be coming or coming fast enough it can shed some clarity on what Covid-19 can do to India. Depending on what measures the country takes, and what impact these measures have on Covid-19 infections in India, coronavirus may end up killing around 1000 people to 5 million people in India, according to the Epidemic Calculator. Why such gap between these two numbers?\nAccording to the Epidemic Calculator, it all depends on flattening the curve, bringing down R0 the rate at which infections spread and at what stage the lockdown was enforced and ordered.\nAt the time of writing, the coronavirus disease of 2019 remains a global health crisis of grave and uncertain magnitude. To the non-expert (such as myself), contextualizing the numbers, forecasts and epidemiological parameters described in the media and literature can be challenging. I created this calculator as an attempt to address this gap in understanding, notes Goh. This calculator implements a classical infectious disease model -- SEIR (Susceptible > Exposed > Infected > Removed) -- an idealized model of spread still used in frontlines of research.\nBy default the tool already has the relevant data, based on the research reports that have come out on Covid-19 from China and other countries so far, in the required fields. To see how Covid-19 will progress in India on the basis of this available data about coronavirus, and how it infects people, how many it kills, for how long it keeps people sick, all you need to do is change the population of the region to India\u2019s population.\nHere are some projections this tool gives as far Covid-19 and its future progression in India is concerned:\nCovid-19 in India with default data\nWith default data, which considers the infection rate R0 of 2.2 it means a coronavirus patient is likely to infect at least two more people the coronavirus Epidemic Calculator indicates that in a year the disease will infect a little over 1 million people in India. Of these, it will kill little over 20,000 people. While you look at these numbers, there are a few important bits to remember.\n-- By default the Epidemic Calculator assumes that on the 100th day after the first reported case the government has forced the region or country into a full lockdown.\n-- The lockdown or intervention in some other way, brings down the R0 to less than 1. This is very important.\n-- If the lockdown or intervention has brought the R0 lower earlier, say just 50 days after the first case was reported, the total number of cases will be significantly less and number of fatalities exponentially lower.\n-- It is also important to remember that by default the Epidemic Calculator considers fatality rate for Covid-19 as 2 per cent. In China, it has been slightly more. In South Korea and Germany it is significantly less. In Italy and Spain, it is alarmingly high, particularly in Italy where it is above 8 per cent. If you consider other figures for India depending on which one you do the covid-19 picture will change.\nThe covid-19 case fatality rate for India is something neither experts nor Epidemic Calculator can predict. The global fatality rate for swine flu is less than 0.1 per cent. But in India, in the previous swine flu epidemics, the death rate has been close to 6 per cent. For Covid-19 only time will tell what is the fatality rate in India.\nCovid-19 in India a best case scenario\nSo, what is the best case scenario for covid-19 in India. If everything works well in India, if government mounts a good response, and death rate is not above 2 per cent, health care system holds up, quarantine is effective, then covid-19 may end up infecting a little above 15,000 people. This also takes into account the fact that in India the first case was detected on January 30 and the lockdown was ordered on March 24. Assuming that the coronavirus became infectious in India a few days before the first patient was detected, we can say that the country mounted effective response on around Day 65 of the disease. This can potentially limit number of Ccovid-19 cases in India to around 15,000 and deaths to around 300. Let's hope this is the case.\nCovid-19 in India worst case scenario\nNow, take the worst case scenario. This is the one where the data that we have so far from the government is not accurate, the quarantine is not effective, the health system is not ready and will not be able to hold up well, that the disease is spreading in India undetected for far longer even though the first case was only found on January 30. In this case, also assume that India\u2019s poor health system will not be able to cope up with Covid-19 when cases start to rise and let\u2019s move the case fatality rate to 4 per cent, which is still significantly lower than what Covid-19 is showing in Italy and Spain but is higher than the global rate. Let\u2019s also assume that the quarantine doesn\u2019t bring down the R0 much. May be a half per cent or so but not enough to flatten the curve in one year.\nIn this case, given that population of India is little over 1.3 billion, we may end up seeing around 180 million infected in the country this year and little over 5 million dead.\nThis is all projection\nIt\u2019s important to note that Covid-19 epidemic calculator is a tool that creates projections on the basis of data you feed into it. And as far as Covid-19 and novel coronavirus are concerned, right now not enough data, and not accurate enough data, is available. Everything is an approximation. What is the real fatality rate of Covid-19? Different countries are showing different numbers and they are all over the place, with extremely huge gaps between them. How quickly and how widely this is R0 that Covid-19 spreads? Again, we don\u2019t know the exact number. Some studies say it is 4. Some say it is 2. Some even say that it is 6.\nThen there are other unknowns. Can Covid-19 re-infect people who were sick with it and then got better? We don\u2019t know for sure. Does temperature India is a very hot country and dry air summer is coming in parts of India affect this coronavirus? And if it does, how much? We don\u2019t know for sure. There are many more factors, like real world conditions. How long Covid-19 patients take to recover? For how long they are infectious? For how long they have to be in a hospital? For how long a country can care for its ICU patients? These are the figures that government experts and policy makers probably know. An online epidemic calculator doesn\u2019t. So if you are giving the online epidemic calculator created by Gabriel Goh a spin, keep this in mind."}, {"content": "China bans trading in wild animals due to the Wuhan coronavirus. It was enough to use a few keywords: &quot;hunting&quot;, &quot;wild flavor&quot;, or &quot;totally natural&quot;. In some of the most popular Chinese e-commerce platforms, until now it was possible to find, with a little research, the most exotic meats. Like the civet, the feline that served as a transmitter to humans of the virus that causes SARS in 2003, at 350 yuan (46 euros) per kilo. Or peacock. Or giant salamanders. It&#39;s not that easy anymore, at least for a while. As a result of the new Wuhan coronavirus, transmitted to humans by an animal sold in one of the markets in that city, the Chinese government has just banned - although for now, only temporarily - the trade and transport of wild species. The joint order issued by three official entities, including the Ministry of Agriculture, prohibits any type of trade with these animals, alive or dead, on any platform, although it specifically mentions electronic commerce, restaurants, supermarkets or markets. Local authorities will increase inspections and punishments for those who violate the ban will be &quot;severe.&quot; The breeding farms of these animals will be quarantined. &quot;Consumers must fully understand the health risks of eating wild animals, they must stay away from the wild taste and eat healthy,&quot; says the rule. The step came after scientists traced the origin of the new coronavirus, which has killed at least 56 people and infected more than 2,000 in China alone - and more than thirty in the rest of the world - to a market in Wuhan City, the epicenter of the infection. Although theoretically the Huanan market \u2014today closed tightly\u2014 was dedicated to the sale of seafood and fish, all kinds of caged animals were also sold inside. A price list that has circulated on social networks included a hundred species, from wolf pups to hedgehogs to camel meat. Also marmots, foxes or monkeys. Or snakes, mice, cats, and dogs. Scientists have not been able to confidently identify the species, but they have determined that the 2019-nCoV coronavirus passed to humans through an animal. A group of Chinese scientists have published that it was probably a snake; others consider that it could be a bat. A situation identical to the one that triggered the SARS epidemic in 2003: scientists determined that the transmitter of that coronavirus - related to that of Wuhan - had been civet meat sold in a market in Canton. That outbreak ended up infecting 8,422 people and killing nearly 800. Then, as now, trade in wild animals was banned. But, as now, temporarily. Interest in consuming these meats also decreased. But temporarily. China remains a voracious consumer of wild animal products, to the point of increasing the risk of extinction for some species. The demand, either as food or for use in traditional medicine, has grown in parallel with the prosperity of the country. Among certain sectors, eating meats the more exotic and difficult to obtain is a way of exhibiting social position. In other cases, such as the consumption of dog at the Yulin festival in the south, eating that meat is almost an act of vindication of supposed national roots. Markets like Wuhan&#39;s are not rare. An investigation published by the Beijing News newspaper last week found that, a month after the first infections were detected in Wuhan, it was still possible to find in different provinces markets willing to sell, restaurants willing to prepare and, in Internet forums, consumers willing to pay whatever it takes for this type of food. The problem in these markets is not only the hygiene conditions in which the animals are kept, often poor. Also the difficulty of establishing the origin of the specimens. Although there are farms that are dedicated to the breeding of these species with a license - it is estimated that the tiger species are home to about 6,000 specimens - activists denounce that it is not uncommon for captured wild animals to end up in some of them; or that the licenses were obtained illegally. Although the virulence of the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak has caused the voices against these practices to multiply. Last week, 19 prominent scientists sent an open letter to the government asking for the limitation of this trade. &quot;It is not only important for ecological conservation, but because of its great importance in controlling public health risks,&quot; they warned. Experts also call for the &quot;loopholes&quot; in permits for the domestication and breeding of wild animals, which allow traffickers to hunt wild animals and sell them on the market through farms, to be resolved. \u201cViruses transmitted by animals are the most common human pathogens. They represent less than 15% of all known species of human pathogens, but more than 65% of pathogens discovered since 1980 &quot;, says in a statement Christian Walzer, the executive director of the NGO Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), based in New York. The consumption of wild meat has also been the subject of a heated debate in Chinese networks. &quot;If humans do not live in harmony with nature, of course nature is going to hit us back!&quot; Commented a Weibo user, the Chinese Twitter. For now, the ban coming from Beijing is only temporary. The order issued this Sunday specifies that it will last only &quot;until the epidemic situation in the whole country disappears.&quot; Organizations like WCS demand that it be made permanent. Not just in China, but all over the world. &quot;If those markets continue, and illegal and unregulated human consumption of wild animals continues, the public will continue to face increased risks from new, potentially deadlier viruses and sources of future pandemics,&quot; says Walzer."}, {"content": "Coronavirus outbreak: Bangladesh suspends visa-on-arrival for Chinese nationals.

SINGAPORE \u2014 Banks here have unveiled packages to help companies and other customers with relief assistance to help tide them over the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak. \n DBS\u00a0and United Overseas Bank (UOB) said that the packages are aimed at helping small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as well as other customers. \n A third bank, OCBC, said that it is working closely with customers, whether individuals, SMEs or large corporates, to mitigate the fallout from the outbreak and to help them through this difficult period. \n Multinational bank Standard Chartered (Stanchart), which has operations in Singapore, said that individuals and small businesses here are facing unprecedented challenges in the near to long term, and it will introduce measures for clients who ask for financial assistance. \n DBS on Thursday (Feb 13) said that it conducted a poll of about 100 SME clients in early February to ascertain their top financial concerns and challenges during this time. \n The top concern for most companies, DBS added, was ensuring consistent cash flow to cover ongoing operating costs. \n To address these concerns, DBS said that it will provide liquidity relief packages to address the SMEs\u2019 most urgent cash-flow needs. \n In particular, the bank said that it will provide a six-month principal repayment moratorium for SME property loans. \n It will also offer an extension of import facilities of up to 60 days to act as immediate cash-flow support for businesses coping with disruptions from the coronavirus\u00a0outbreak. \n \u201cThese initiatives will be available upon application to customers with good repayment histories,\u201d DBS said, adding that affected retail customers with good repayment histories can apply for a six-month principal repayment moratorium for mortgage loans. \n In its press statement on Thursday, OCBC said that it will offer targeted support measures to assist customers across its core markets affected by the\u00a0outbreak \u2014 including\u00a0mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Malaysia and Singapore. \n These measures include allowing customers to restructure their loans such as\u00a0home mortgages and business loans, and providing a moratorium on principal repayment for loans such as\u00a0home mortgages and business loans. \n Besides these, it will be extending the due date of the affected business\u2019 trade finance bills as well as extending bridging loans in the form of more working capital financing to affected businesses. \n Join us on Telegram to get TODAY's top stories on mobile:  \n OCBC\u2019s group chief executive officer Samuel Tsien said: \u201cWe will not put a cap on the help that we will extend to our customers. This Covid-19 outbreak is unfortunate and unanticipated. It is our banking and social responsibility to support our customers to help them overcome this market challenge which is not of their own making.\u201d\u00a0 \n He added: \u201cWe will help each of our customers as the case may justify and not on a first-come-first-serve basis. As we at OCBC put it, we must be \u2018simply spot on\u2019 on the assistance that our customers need.\u201d \n Relief measures to be introduced by Stanchart include waivers of late payment fee and late interest charges for credit cards and personal loans, as well as late fee and default fee waivers for retail mortgages. \n Mr Dwaipayan Sadhu, Stanchart\u2019s head of retail banking, said: \u201cWe understand that this can be a stressful time for everyone and we want to help our clients alleviate some financial burden in the short term, if they need it during this period.\u201d \n On Wednesday, UOB announced that it has allocated S$3 billion to provide companies \u2014 especially SMEs \u2014 with relief assistance to address their near-term liquidity needs in the face of the likely economic fallout of the virus\u00a0outbreak. \n The bank\u2019s relief measures aim to enable affected companies \u2014 which\u00a0have good track records and have been servicing their repayments promptly \u2014 to have more flexibility in their cash-flow management. \n In its press release, UOB said that the measures would include allowing affected businesses to rework their principal repayments and to service only their loan interest for up to one year; extending up to one year working capital financing of up to S$5 million; and offering financing liquidity against mortgage security. \n UOB\u2019s deputy chairman and CEO Wee Ee Cheong said: \u201cIn these particularly trying times, the Government, businesses and communities are doing their very best to overcome this immediate challenge. We at UOB want to play our part in our commitment to caring for our clients\u2019 businesses.\u201d\u00a0 \n He added: \u201cFor most companies, especially the SMEs, cash flow and financing are key to them sustaining their business. As their long-term banking partner, we believe our added support can help alleviate the business disruption and pressure from the ripple effect of the epidemic.\u201d \n Aside from extending help to the SMEs, UOB said that it will also assess retail customers who are affected by the \u201ccurrent circumstances\u201d on a case-by-case basis. \n OTHER MEASURES IN PLACE \n In its press release on Thursday, DBS said that it is working with partners to provide Singaporeans with subsidised or complimentary services to \u201cnavigate these challenging times\u201d.\u00a0 \n These include partnering with education firm 88Tuition to offer unlimited, free online supplementary lessons for primary and secondary school students from Feb 17 to April 30. This will\u00a0allow students to continue to take classes while having minimal contact with others. \n The bank also announced a partnership with transport company ComfortDelGro in its initiative to use DBS\u2019 debit or credit cards for street-hail hires, which will help in contact tracing. \n To show solidarity and support to healthcare workers and the broader frontline community, DBS will work with community partners to provide them with tokens of appreciation, such as care packages and food-and-beverages treats. \n Mr Shee Tse Koon, DBS Singapore country head, said: \u201cIn these difficult times, we feel it is incumbent upon us as Singapore\u2019s largest bank to lend a helping hand to our clients and the public-at-large. We hope the liquidity measures will go some way in easing the financial pressure that some individuals and SMEs may face.\u201d \n He added: \u201cOther initiatives are intended to help customers adjust to the little changes they may have to make in daily living. Overall, we hope that these small gestures will go a long way in encouraging the community to press on.\u201d"}, {"content": "Stocks lost \u20ac7 billion in February. Because of the &#39;black swan&#39; that appeared in Wuhan. The Chinese coronavirus caused a stock market crash in February on a global scale that led to an estimated &#39;break&#39; of \u20ac6.9 billion (7.6 billion dollars) in world capitalization. The equivalent of the sum of the GDP of Germany, France and Spain. The new coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China and has already entered the gallery of &#39;black swans&#39;, the metaphor created by Nassim Taleb for unexpected events with disruptive consequences in financial markets and the economy. Ironically, the &#39;black swan&#39; derived from the new coronavirus (which is associated with the disease called Covid-10) had at its origin a large horseshoe bat sold in the live animal market in that Chinese city. After a January drop of 1.2%, the MSCI world index plunged 8.2% in February, according to data released this weekend by financial analyst MSCI (formerly Morgan Stanley Capital International). A drop much higher than the two most recent bumps on stock exchanges in May and August 2018. The world index covers 23 developed markets (including the Lisbon stock exchange) and 26 emerging (including the two Chinese stock exchanges). The world capitalization was around 93 billion dollars at the end of January, taking into account data from the World Federation of Exchanges, which covers all exchanges on the planet. With the February crash, world capitalization dropped to values \u200b\u200bclose to those of September last year. The region with the biggest percentage drop in February was the euro zone. The MSCI index for this region fell 9.1%, a greater decline than that seen in New York, where the respective MSCI index lost 8.3%. The fall in the PSI 20 index in Lisbon was 9.3%. In New York, Wall Street registered a true Black Thursday on February 27th with the Dow Jones 30 index recording the biggest collapse (in points) in its history and the volatility index reaching levels close to those of August 2011. The end of the month could have been even more dramatic on Wall Street had the US Federal Reserve not published a statement by its president Jerome Powell earlier on Friday afternoon guaranteeing that the central bank will use &quot;all tools&quot; to support the US economy, whose &quot;foundations remain solid.&quot; Donald Trump would later add that he expects the &quot;Fed to get involved&quot; and &quot;soon.&quot; The US central bank&#39;s key rate futures - which are in the range between 1.5% and 1.75% - point to three rate cuts until the summer, starting at the next meeting on March 18, with a reduction 50 basis points of the cost of money for the range between 1% and 1.25%. By August, the key rate was expected to drop to 0.5% to 0.75%, according to the futures market tracked by the CME. Many investors expect a coordinated response from the world&#39;s leading central banks to the threat to economies to take place, albeit informally. Next week, the meetings of the central banks of Australia and Canada will be followed with the utmost attention. In the next two weeks, the meetings of the European Central Bank (on March 12th) and the Fed (on March 18th) are held, which will discuss new forecasts for inflation and growth. Although the epicenter of the new coronavirus is in China and the first wave of contagion covers Asia, the region&#39;s stocks lost 6.1% in February, according to the MSCI index for Asia Pacific, a percentage drop much smaller than registered globally. The region that registered the deepest crash in February was Latin America, with the respective MSCI index losing 12.4%. In raw materials markets, the price of a barrel of oil led the falls in February. The price of Brent (European variety) dropped 14% and the price of WTI (North American) dropped 13%. Brent&#39;s price dropped to $50 at the end of the month, a price level that hadn&#39;t been seen since the summer of 2017. Two raw materials stood out in February&#39;s rises: palladium, a rare metal indispensable for catalysts from automobiles, which is more expensive than gold, and coffee. Despite the financial panic reinforcing, as a rule, the rush to safe haven values, the price of gold rose only 0.2% in February, as investors decided to sell in order to obtain liquidity. The rush to safe values \u200b\u200bcaused a sharp drop in interest on 10-year US Treasury bonds, which dropped to new historic lows, closing February at 1.16%. German 10-year bonds, another safe haven, fell further into negative territory, having closed at -0.6%."}, {"content": "Chinese probe finds coronavirus whistle-blower doctor was punished 'inappropriately'. BEIJING (AFP) - Police in China's virus epicentre Wuhan acted \"inappropriately\" by punishing a doctor who blew the whistle on the outbreak that has now killed more than 9,000 worldwide, a Chinese government investigation found on Thursday (March 19). \n Dr Li Wenliang, one of a group of doctors in Wuhan who shared posts on social media warning of a Sars-like virus spreading in the city in December, was reprimanded by police for sharing the information and made to sign a statement agreeing not to commit any more \"law-breaking actions\". \n His death from the virus in February prompted a national outpouring of grief as well as anger at the government's handling of the crisis, and bold demands for freedom of speech. \n A central government investigation initiated after Dr Li's death found that Wuhan police \"acted inappropriately by issuing a disciplinary letter\" and took \"irregular law enforcement procedures,\" state broadcaster CCTV reported on Thursday. \n The investigators also found that Dr Li's colleagues had repeatedly attempted to resuscitate the 34-year-old before he was declared dead because he was \"very young\", CCTV said. \n State media said his colleagues told investigators, \"as long as there was a bit of hope, we were unwilling to give up, at the time there were no other factors\". \n The central government investigators \"suggest\" that Wuhan authorities \"supervise and rectify the matter\", and urged local police to revoke the disciplinary statement issued to Dr Li, according to CCTV. \n Beijing has sought to direct criticism over the mishandling of the virus outbreak onto provincial officials, with several of the region's top Communist Party and health officials sacked. \n Dr Li's death had initially been reported by state media before their reports were quickly deleted. Wuhan Central Hospital confirmed Dr Li's death only hours later, after saying he was undergoing emergency treatment. \n Social media users who immediately took to the Twitter-like Weibo platform in droves to mourn Dr Li - before posts related to his death were scrubbed by censors - had accused hospital authorities of inappropriately attempting to resuscitate him after he had already died. \n China reported zero domestic Covid-19 infections for the first time on Thursday, even as nations across the world shut down in a desperate effort to contain the pandemic. \n China's central government has sought to distance itself from the origins of the disease, initially by sacking local officials blamed for allowing the virus to spread, and recently by supporting the conspiracy theory that Covid-19 originated in the United States."}, {"content": "Coronavirus\u00a0outbreak: Goa govt to form special task force.

The number of cases in France of the new coronavirus detected in China rose to three, the first detected in Europe, announced this Friday the French Ministry of Health. According to a statement released by the guardianship, quoted by Agence France-Presse, this third case, a &quot;close relative&quot; of one of the other two diagnosed, was &quot;under investigation&quot; and &quot;has just been confirmed&quot;. The three people have been to China and are hospitalized in Bordeaux and Paris, with &quot;isolation&quot; measures. The ministry announced that for each of the diagnosed cases, an &quot;epidemiological investigation&quot; was initiated. The French Health Minister, Agnes Buzyn, admitted the emergence of more cases. The new virus, which causes pneumonia, was detected in China in late 2019 and has already caused the death of at least 26 people. On the Chinese mainland there are records of more than 800 infected people and about 1,000 suspected cases, with cases having been confirmed in Macau, Thailand, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan, the United States and France. Chinese authorities consider the country to be at the &quot;most critical&quot; point in terms of virus prevention and control and have quarantined, preventing entry and exit, three cities where more than 18 million people live --- Wuhan, where it started the outbreak, and neighboring Huanggang and Ezhou. In Portugal, the Directorate-General for Health announced the activation of preventive public health devices, while the European Center for Disease Control raised the risk of contagion in the European Union to &quot;moderate&quot;, continuing to monitor the situation and carry out assessments rapid risk assessments. The Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization, meeting on Wednesday and Thursday, chose not to declare an international public health emergency, although it recognizes that there is such a risk. The first cases of the &quot;2019 -- nCoV&quot; coronavirus appeared in the city of Wuhan, capital and largest city in Hubei province, in central China, when people with viral pneumonia began arriving at hospitals. Symptoms associated with an infection caused by this new coronavirus are more intense than a flu and include fever, pain, malaise and breathing difficulties, including shortness of breath. Preliminary data, released by the medical journal The Lancet, point to some similarities between the new coronavirus and the coronavirus that was at the origin of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, first identified in China a long time ago."}, {"content": "Worried Chinese turn to online doctor consultations amid coronavirus outbreak. Spooked by a sneeze or a cough, Chinese consumers are turning to online consultations in droves for advice about possible coronavirus symptoms - a boon for a fledgling industry that has struggled to win over customers.\nDue to the epidemic, hundreds of millions of Chinese are stuck at home due to quarantine restrictions imposed by authorities or companies. Even if not under quarantine, many are too worried to venture for long outside or to visit a hospital for other ailments as they fear they might catch the highly contagious virus.\nThe surge of inquiries has also been driven by healthcare platforms offering some services for free amid the epidemic.\nJD Health, an arm of JD.com Inc (JD.O), has seen its daily volume of respiratory-related online consultations jump by nine times while mental-health consultations have grown five to seven times, according to Xiao Jianbo, the company's general manager of online healthcare.\n\"Most of the requests I've had between the end of January and mid-February were about the coronavirus,\" said Liu Yafeng, a doctor who works fulltime for JD Health. \"People are so worried even just by a sneeze.\"\nSuch is the state of fretfulness that \"Always thinking I've been infected by the virus\" has become a trending topic with more than 570 million views on Weibo, China's Twitter-like microblogging platform.\nLiu said he worked around 12 hours per day from end January to mid-February, but in a positive sign that panic about the epidemic is receding, he is now working eight hours a day.\nBaidu Inc (BIDU.O) said its online doctor consultation platform Wenyisheng, which translates to \"Ask Doctor\", has been handling around 850,000 free inquiries daily. Of those 400,000 were respiratory-related, around 50 times the level seen a year earlier.\nAlibaba Health Information Technology Ltd (0241.HK) said it exceeded 100,000 consultations a day on Jan. 29 and that some of its respiratory doctors were providing more than 200 consultations daily. It did not provide comparisons with pre-outbreak levels.\nOnline healthcare has long been seen as a promising sector in China, where there is a dearth of doctors and patients often have to travel hundreds of miles to see a specialist.\nBut the industry had struggled to win over customers and big listed firms like Alibaba Health and Ping An Good Doctor (1833.HK) have yet to turn a profit. Compared to other internet services, online healthcare is not used as frequently and does not benefit as much from word of mouth, industry executives say.\n\"Health consultations are very private, so you don't see a lot of people sharing their healthcare experience with friends or followers on social media,\" said JD Health's Xiao.\nThe coronavirus has, however, reset expectations with shares in Alibaba Health surging 58% for the year to date while Ping An Good Doctor's stock has climbed 33%.\nWhile analysts say more venture capital funding could soon flow into the sector, some industry veterans warn that the sector has a long way to go.\n\"The outbreak has in fact educated the market, but I don't think China's online healthcare has really taken off because of this,\" said Simon He, founding partner at Shanghai-based Eminence Ventures.\nThat's only going to happen with innovation in providing more services such as blood tests, he added."}, {"content": "Undetected cases in China caused the new coronavirus to spread rapidly. The undetected cases were \u201clargely\u201d responsible for the rapid spread of covid-19 in China. Many of these people would not have very severe symptoms of the disease. These are the main conclusions of a study published this Monday in the scientific journal Science. To arrive at these results, the scientists used a computer model based on data from reported infections in China and mobility between January 10 (the day it was announced that there was a new coronavirus infecting humans) and February 8 in China . With this, three great results were obtained. First, it was noted that 86 percent of all infections caused by the new coronavirus were not reported before travel was blocked on January 23 in Wuhan, the Chinese city that was once the epicenter of the epidemic. Then, it was seen that, per person, the transmission rate of undocumented infections was 55% in relation to documented infections. And undetected cases were even the source of infection for 79% of detected cases. Finally, it is noteworthy that the drastic measures of the Chinese Government and people&#39;s understanding reduced the rate of spread of the virus in China. After all, after travel restrictions and restraining measures were imposed, the spread of the outbreak in China slowed down. &quot;The explosion of covid-19 cases in China was driven largely by people with mild symptoms or even no symptoms that had gone undetected,&quot; says a statement Jeffrey Shaman, a researcher at Columbia University&#39;s Mailman School of Public Health ( United States) and one of the authors of the study. \u201cUndetected cases can expose a much larger portion of the population to the virus.

It at least shows that China is victorious, said Zhang Yulun, 35, returning to Wuhan for work.\nChina\u2019s National Health Commission said on Saturday that 54 new coronavirus cases were reported on the mainland on Friday, all involving so-called imported cases.

So, there shouldn\u2019t be a problem, Yuan Hai, 30, a passenger on a reopened metro line said when asked about the risks. But you have to be careful.\nThe existence of an unknown number of asymptomatic carriers of coronavirus in China has raised concerns among the public that lifting the restrictions may release thousands of people who could still be spreading the virus that causes COVID-19, without knowing they are sick.\nLife in Wuhan remains far from normal. The vast majority of shops are shut while bright yellow roadblocks remain. Wuhan will not let people leave the city until April 8.\nSome people at the railway station, such as a woman who only gave her surname as Zhang, said they were there to see if there was any chance people could leave earlier.\nHer grandson came to visit her for the week-long Lunar New Year holiday in January and has been separated from his parents in the southern city of Shenzhen ever since.

A 66-year-old man from Wuhan, China tested positive to Covid-19 last month after staying at Shangri-La\u2019s Rasa Sentosa. \n A few weeks later, the couple felt confident in Singapore\u2019s ability to keep Covid-19 in check, and chose to keep up their romantic tradition. \n \u201cOur mindset is that, ironically, the places in Singapore right now with confirmed cases of the virus are actually the cleanest places, because so much effort has been spent to make sure that these places are now disinfected. So Sentosa is actually pretty ideal for us now,\u201d Ms Teo said. \n Mr Cheong said: \u201cMost Singaporeans my age that I know aren\u2019t really bothered by the outbreak. We don\u2019t wear facemasks when we head out, although we wash our hands more often.\u201d \n Ms Teo added: \u201cI guess going ahead with our Valentine\u2019s Day plan is my way of actively choosing not to let the virus affect my life any further than it should.\u201d \n In the same way, Mr Chua Kok Teng, 44, is undeterred by the Covid-19 outbreak from taking his wife out to dinner tonight. \n But instead of dining in a restaurant at Dempsey Hill or Tanjong Pagar like they usually do on Valentine\u2019s Day, the couple will spend this year\u2019s occasion supping on ma la hot pot at an open air eatery. \n \u201cWe have never had ma la together, so my wife chose a place near our home in Clementi,\u201d said Mr Chua, who is an engineer in the oil and gas industry. The pair do not drive, and decided to eat close to where they live in order to avoid taking transport to town. \n Other couples whom TODAY spoke to also had the Covid-19 outbreak in the back of their minds when planning for their Valentine\u2019s Day celebrations. \n For their first Valentine\u2019s Day together, Ms Angie Ching, 22, a student at Singapore Institute of Management, and her boyfriend Mr Tan Jun Xiong, 23, will be taking a long bus ride instead of their originally-planned MRT trip to their dinner spot at Bendemeer, in a bid to minimise the number of people they come in close contact with. \n Ms Ching reasoned that a bus typically has fewer passengers than a train. \n The lovebirds also initially wanted to spend the entirety of Saturday together, but decided to just have lunch and a karaoke session that day instead. \n Ms Ching said she felt sad and upset when she first feared they would have to scrap their romantic evening, as the duo have barely had time to be alone with one another in the last month due to the Chinese New Year celebrations and Mr Tan working on weekdays. \n Now that they elected to continue with most of their plans since they believe the outbreak situation here is under control, Ms Ching said: \u201cI feel excited but a little wary, because the virus is still here in Singapore, and we have to stay vigilant and extra careful.\u201d \n Mr Tan, who is working as an accountant while waiting for his university term to start, told TODAY: \u201cLife still goes on, as long as we take care of ourselves and take a little more precaution during this period of time, then there\u2019s no need to make it seem as though the world has stopped.\u201d \n \u201cAlso, it\u2019s our first Valentine\u2019s together, a day where couples celebrate their love for each other. Why would we want to miss this?\u201d \n Another couple, Mr Gareth Yeo, 33, who works as an IT specialist, and his wife Ms Sharon Yu, 32, a nurse working in a general hospital ward, will be spending most of their Valentine\u2019s Day at home, making popiah for lunch, catching an afternoon movie on the sofa and having a quiet dinner at a restaurant in Sembawang. \n However, the reason they chose to remain indoors was not out of fear they might catch Covid-19, but rather because they felt that Ms Yu needed some extra rest. \n After working almost non-stop for the past seven days as part of her shift schedule, Ms Yu said it was a coincidence that one of her off-days fell on Valentine\u2019s Day, and it was the perfect opportunity for her to spend time with her husband. \n \u201cWhen I\u2019m on night shift, I don\u2019t get to see him at all, because he comes home at 7.30pm and I leave at 7pm, and when I come back in the morning he is already off to work,\u201d she said. \n Mr Yeo, who took a leave day on Friday to be with his wife, planned the whole day for them both. \n \u201cIt feels like she was gone for a very long time, and now she\u2019s back. She\u2019s been very focused on her work for the past few days, and she\u2019s simply had no time for other activities besides sleep, work, and cooking some simple meals,\u201d he said. \n \u201cI think she deserves some time to unwind after having such hectic working days,\u201d he added. \n One couple refused to let Covid-19 alter their Valentine\u2019s Day arrangements at all. \n Mr Yuen, 60, and Mrs Yuen, 58, who wish to be known only by their surnames, said that while their Valentine\u2019s Day plans were simple, they would still continue with them as planned. \n \u201cI\u2019m not overly concerned, we just have to make sure we take the necessary precautions. So we won\u2019t have any changes in our plan,\u201d said Mr Yuen, who works as group head of engagement and programs at the Centre for Fathering. \n The couple have been married for 31 years with three grown children, and will be going out on Saturday evening for vegan food, which they said they have been experimenting with recently. \n Mrs Yuen, who is a project manager, said: \u201cWe usually take time off and do dinner, but our objective is to connect with one another.

The Spanish Prime Minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, made this Wednesday in parliament an appeal for &quot;political unity&quot; and asked all representatives of the Spanish parties to contribute to fighting the covid-19 with &quot;the maximum of vision&quot; and &quot;sense of State&quot;. The head of the Government, of the Spanish Socialist Workers Party (PSOE), appeared before the plenary session of the Congress of Deputies (lower house of parliament) in an almost empty hemicycle, with only about thirty deputies in the benches, as the majority did not attend to prevent the spread of the pandemic. The session without the presence of journalists or audience in the galleries was called for S\u00e1nchez to explain to the chamber, as provided for in the Spanish Constitution, the reasons that led the Government to decree a &#39;state of emergency&#39; to face the new coronavirus. Pedro S\u00e1nchez underlined that the pandemic does not distinguish between colors or ideologies and is an &quot;enemy of all&quot; and, therefore, must be fought &quot;through unity and collective responsibility&quot;. The head of government stressed that with this crisis preferences and priorities &quot;changed&quot; and as political leaders everyone is subject to &quot;the highest degree of demand from citizens&quot;. &quot;Just as we ask for discipline to all citizens, we must strive to be equal to our citizens, giving all our effort and time&quot; and contributing to that sense of state, said the head of the executive. The leader of the biggest opposition party, Pablo Casado of the Popular Party (PP, right), then assured that Pedro S\u00e1nchez was not &quot;alone&quot; to face the coronavirus pandemic and that he could count on the support of his formation. Casado assured S\u00e1nchez&#39;s support even, according to him, if he finds it difficult to pass difficult measures that may not be accepted by the far-left coalition Unidas Podemos, the PSOE&#39;s partners in the Spanish government. The Spanish Prime Minister also warned that the hardest part of the crisis &quot;is yet to come&quot; when the health system &quot;receives the impact of a greater number of infected people&quot;. &quot;Until the vaccine arrives, we are the vaccine,&quot; said S\u00e1nchez, who called for citizen unity, called for &quot;sacrifice and unity&quot; and insisted that every person who stays at home &quot;helps to save lives and helps the curve [of the pandemic ] going down&quot;. &quot;Each one of us is the barrier that can stop this fire and put an end to it as quickly as possible,&quot; he said. The head of government also guaranteed that the food supply is guaranteed, as well as that of electricity, gas and oil-derived fuels. S\u00e1nchez conveyed a message of &quot;absolute tranquility&quot; to emphasize the guarantee of food supplies &quot;in all supermarkets and stores&quot; opened for this purpose. Power supply and &quot;critical infrastructure&quot; are also guaranteed to ensure the &quot;protection of essential services&quot;. The prime minister began by explaining the measures taken within the framework of the current &quot;state of emergency&quot; which he announced on Tuesday where 200 billion euros, almost 20% of GDP, are mobilized to combat the economic and social effects in the country of Covid-19 pandemic caused by the new coronavirus S\u00e1nchez stressed that the package of measures to fight the new coronavirus approved by the Council of Ministers, that of that total amount, &quot;the biggest mobilization of economic resources in the recent history of Spain&quot;, 117 billion will be &quot;entirely public&quot; and the rest private.Spain is one of the countries most affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, having registered until Tuesday 11,178 positive cases since the beginning of the outbreak, of which 491 people have died and 1,098 have been cured. The coronavirus responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic has infected more than 189,000 people, of whom more than 7,800 have died.Of those infected worldwide, more than 81,000 have recovered from the disease. or China, in December, and spread to more than 146 countries and territories, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a pandemic situation. The most affected countries after China are Italy, with 2,503 deaths to 31,506 cases, Iran, with 988 deaths (16,169 cases), Spain, with 491 deaths (11,178 cases) and France with 148 deaths (6,633 cases). In light of the advance of the pandemic, several countries adopted exceptional measures, including the quarantine regime and the closure of borders."}, {"content": "Coronavirus: the new disease that puts the world on alert. During the last days, a condition called coronavirus has been news worldwide, due to the virus that causes it, which, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), can cause various diseases in humans and animals, which can go from a common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, coronaviruses are common throughout the world, they can infect and make people sick, however, the new outbreak is called 2019-nCoV and was identified on January 9, 2020. According to Telesur, the virus is believed to have spread from a seafood market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, but authorities identified cases that had no contact with that place. Both China and the who have warned about the ease of spread of this disease, which, according to authorities of the Asian giant, claimed its 17th victim on Wednesday. On the other hand, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO-WHO) asked to reinforce surveillance actions against the possible occurrence of events related to the new coronavirus and recommended that health workers stay informed about the disease, become familiar with the principles and procedures to manage infections and be trained to consult the travel history of patients. The Chinese city of Wuhan, of 11 million inhabitants and capital of the central province of Hubei, canceled public transportation in an effort to contain the disease, according to Prensa Latina. The city closed its airports, train stations and stopped subway and bus services. The local government also called to stay in the city, and those who need to leave for reasons of force majeure must request a special permit. According to rtve, the local government also suspended group tours and public events, including celebrations for the lunar new year."}, {"content": "Australia bans travelers from China. Because of the coronavirus outbreak, the Australian government has imposed an entry ban on travelers from China. Australian citizens and permanent residents and their relatives are exempt from the ban, said Prime Minister Scott Morrison. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has tightened its travel advice for China and now recommends Australians not to travel to China. The entry ban will be implemented by the border authorities with immediate effect, announced Morrison. The exempted travelers would have to go into a two-week &quot;self-quarantine&quot; when they return to the country, he said. Morisson is following the example of the US government, which had already imposed a similar entry ban the day before. The exceptions to the US ban are the same as the Australian rule, and the US has also issued a travel warning. The Chinese government criticized the US for the travel ban. A spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry said it was &quot;certainly not benevolent,&quot; said a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry. While the World Health Organization (WHO) advised against travel restrictions, the USA &quot;rushed to take the opposite path&quot;. The &quot;words and actions of certain US officials&quot; are neither true nor &quot;appropriate&quot;. US Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross was also criticized. As reported by the New York Times, he said in an interview with Fox Business that the virus outbreak could help move jobs in China back to the US. Companies would have to consider the virus when planning their supply chains. The WHO had declared an international health emergency because of the virus. Linked to this is above all the publication of specific recommendations for action to all countries in order to contain the virus. When announcing the decision, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stressed that it was not a &quot;vote of no confidence&quot; against China. Travel and trade restrictions are not necessary. At the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organization WHO an accumulation of pneumonia of unknown cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Just a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days later, a group led by virologist Christian Drosten from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers are provisionally calling 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. The Chinese authorities suspect the source of the pathogen to be a food market in Wuhan, where not only fish and seafood but also exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected. Both Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic in 2002 and 2003, around 8,000 people were infected and more than 750 died. Between its discovery in 2012 and the end of 2019, around 2,500 people were infected with the Mers virus, and every third person died from it. In total, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example. Several thousand people have now become ill in China, some of them - most of them probably with previous illnesses - died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first cases of infection outside of China became known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been to Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who was returning from Wuhan, and on January 24, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia, which can be fatal. Since it is a viral disease, antibiotics won&#39;t help. It is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after a dozen or so cases among medical personnel became known. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. As it announced on January 24, the World Health Organization currently expects that an infected person will infect an average of 1.4 to 2.5 other people. If these numbers prove to be true, the virus is less contagious than Sars and so is the flu. The WHO recommends following general hygiene rules: You should wash your hands often and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals. It is not yet possible to say with certainty. The World Health Organization announced on January 28th that around a fifth of the reported cases would become seriously ill from the virus, so if in doubt they would have to be treated in intensive care. According to reports, the first fatalities were patients, some of whom had serious previous illnesses. People with previous illnesses are also particularly at risk from other infectious diseases - such as the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, i.e. change their genetic makeup. That can make them more dangerous to people in the course of an outbreak - but also the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate that is as high as that of the Sars outbreak. Australia reported the first three coronavirus cases last Saturday, and the number of infected people in the country is now nine. A total of almost 12,000 cases have been registered worldwide. The number of suspected cases is over 15,000 and 259 people have died, all of them in China. In total, the virus has spread to 27 countries; outside of China, a little more than a hundred people have been affected so far. In Germany, seven people were infected with the virus. According to doctors, at least six of them are in good condition; no information has yet been given on one case. An Air Force plane that is supposed to bring more than a hundred Germans back from Wuhan has already started and is due to arrive at Frankfurt Airport in the morning. According to Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, none of the Germans who flown out of China are infected. Nevertheless, a two-week quarantine at a Bundeswehr location in Rhineland-Palatinate applies to them after their arrival. Other countries such as the USA and Japan also let nationals fly out."}, {"content": "Reuters: the number of people infected with the new coronavirus in the United States reaches 13.

The accounts are from analysts cited by the Hollywood Reporter magazine, who estimate that the losses could rise or even exceed \u2014 all it takes is the world&#39;s largest exhibition market, the US, to also fall victim to the drop in affluence \u2014 the 4.5 billion euros. The main damages are mainly related to the showing of cinema in the countries most affected by the coronavirus, and which in some cases are even in the most important markets in the world. There is no deadline to regularize the situation regarding the decisions of companies and authorities, nor for the confidence of some spectators to return. The countries most affected by the sharp drop in viewers are China (second largest market in the world), South Korea (fifth largest market in the world), Italy or Japan (third largest market in the world). In addition, in the entertainment world, there are musical tours postponed to their Asian portions or promotional or press events that shift to Skype sessions or web conferences, cinema closings, viewers fleeing and premiere cancellations in the important Chinese or South Korean markets are having a direct impact on cinema. In China there are 70,000 cinemas closed and no reopening is scheduled for the coming months. A gigantic drop in box office results is palpable in the numbers: Variety magazine cites data from film market analyst Comscore showing how in the first two months of 2020 the Chinese box office earned just 214 million euros (gross) against 1.8 billion euros that it had cashed in in 2019. In the last month alone, that of the Chinese New Year and the one in which the Covid-19 outbreak became known, revenues went from 1.5 billion euros in 2019 to a mere 4 .2 million euros this year. In South Korea the loss is 70% compared to last year. &quot;The theaters are open, but better not be,&quot; an anonymous distributor tells the Hollywood Reporter. \u201cThe situation is much worse than what we saw during the MERS outbreak in 2015 [Middle East respiratory syndrome \u2014 MERS-CoV]. At the time there was a drop in attendance of more than 40% but there were no closed cinemas and the market resurrected after a month\u201d, says the head of the Film Commission of South Korea to the same publication. Viewers tend to avoid theaters at a time when that there are already more than 4,800 cases in the country, where, for example, the premiere of a black-and-white version of Parasites, the South Korean film that historically won the Oscars this year, has been postponed. In Japan (980 confirmed cases this Tuesday), it is estimated that there is a 10 to 15% drop in the box office. In Italy, the biggest European focus of the new disease, just last weekend the turnout to Italian cinemas dropped 75% compared to the same weekend in 2019, for example. This week in Italy there are about 850 screens not working \u2014 the total in the country is 1830, recalls Variety. Premieres of some North American films have been postponed. Also in China, North American movie premieres for the coming weeks and months are on hold: the premieres of Mulan, 007: No Time to Die, Dolittle, 191, Jojo Rabbit, Sonic the Movie, have been postponed; in South Korea, the debut of Bora L\u00e1, by Pixar, is also undated. Delaying simultaneous global debuts, notably failing the important Chinese market, increases the risk of piracy and further loss of revenue. Looking to the future is a difficult thing right now. In the Chinese capital, for example, it is necessary to comply with the directives of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and of the Municipal Cinema Office, which since February 26 have required the authorities to approve in advance the entry into operation of cinemas. To reopen it is necessary that tickets are only sold in alternate lines and only to spectators who identify themselves. Each room must be thoroughly disinfected right after one session and before the next. As for filming, recalls Variety, if the teams are less than 50 people, they are almost automatically allowed to film in Beijing as long as the workers&#39; body temperature does not exceed 37 degrees Fahrenheit and that everyone (except actors) wear masks. Larger teams are still prohibited from working. \u201cLooking at the current situation, the film industry is not equipped to get back to work,\u201d admits Chen Bei, deputy secretary general of Beijing&#39;s municipal government.

PITTSBURG, Pennsylvania: Snakes \u2013 the Chinese krait and the Chinese cobra \u2013 may be the original source of the newly discovered coronavirus that has triggered an outbreak of a deadly infectious respiratory illness in China this winter. \n The illness was first reported in late December 2019 in Wuhan, a major city in central China, and has been rapidly spreading. Since then, sick travelers from Wuhan have infected people in China and other countries, including the United States. \n Using samples of the virus isolated from patients, scientists in China have determined the genetic code of the virus and used microscopes to photograph it. The pathogen responsible for this pandemic is a new coronavirus. \n It\u2019s in the same family of viruses as the well-known severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS), which have killed hundreds of people in the past 17 years. \n The World Health Organization (WHO) has named the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV.\u00a0But there are many questions that need to be answered to curb the spread of this public health threat. \n THE DEADLY WUHAN CORONAVIRUS \n The name of coronavirus comes from its shape, which resembles a crown or solar corona when imaged using an electron microscope. \n Coronavirus is transmitted through the air and primarily infects the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract of mammals and birds. \n Though most of the members of the coronavirus family only cause mild flu-like symptoms during infection, SARS and MERS can infect both upper and lower airways and cause severe respiratory illness and other complications in humans. \n  \n This new 2019-nCoV causes similar symptoms to SARS and MERS. People infected with these coronaviruses suffer a severe inflammatory response. \n Unfortunately, there is no approved vaccine or antiviral treatment available for coronavirus infection. \n A better understanding of the life cycle of 2019-nCoV, including the source of the virus, how it is transmitted and how it replicates are needed to both prevent and treat the disease. \n THE PROBLEM WITH ZOONOTIC TRANSMISSIONS \n Both SARS and MERS are classified as zoonotic viral diseases, meaning the first patients who were infected acquired these viruses directly from animals. \n This was possible because while in the animal host, the virus had acquired a series of genetic mutations that allowed it to infect and multiply inside humans. \n Now these viruses can be transmitted from person to person. \n Field studies have revealed that the original source of SARS and MERS is the bat, and that the masked palm civets (a mammal native to Asia and Africa) and camels, respectively, served as intermediate hosts between bats and humans. \n In the case of this 2019 coronavirus outbreak, reports state that most of the first group of patients hospitalised were workers or customers at a local seafood wholesale market which also sold processed meats and live consumable animals including poultry, donkeys, sheep, pigs, camels, foxes, badgers, bamboo rats, hedgehogs and reptiles. \n  \n However, since no one has ever reported finding a coronavirus infecting aquatic animals, it is plausible that the coronavirus may have originated from other animals sold in that market. \n The hypothesis that the 2019-nCoV jumped from an animal at the market is strongly supported by a new publication in the Journal of Medical Virology. The scientists conducted an analysis and compared the genetic sequences of 2019-nCoV and all other known coronaviruses. \n The study of the genetic code of 2019-nCoV reveals that the new virus is most closely related to two bat SARS-like coronavirus samples from China, initially suggesting that, like SARS and MERS, the bat might also be the origin of 2019-nCoV. \n The authors further found that the RNA coding sequence of 2019-nCoV spike protein, which forms the \u201ccrown\u201d of the virus particle that recognises the receptor on a host cell, indicates that the bat virus might have mutated before infecting people. \n But when the researchers performed a more detailed bioinformatics analysis of the sequence of 2019-nCoV, it suggests that this coronavirus might come from snakes. \n FROM BATS TO SNAKES \n The researchers used an analysis of the protein codes favoured by the new coronavirus and compared it to the protein codes from coronaviruses found in different animal hosts, like birds, snakes, marmots, hedgehogs, manis, bats and humans. \n Surprisingly, they found that the protein codes in the 2019-nCoV are most similar to those used in snakes. \n Snakes often hunt for bats in wild. \n Reports indicate that snakes were sold in the local seafood market in Wuhan, raising the possibility that the 2019-nCoV might have jumped from the host species \u2013 bats \u2013 to snakes and then to humans at the beginning of this coronavirus outbreak. \n However, how the virus could adapt to both the cold-blooded and warm-blooded hosts remains a mystery. \n The authors of the report and other researchers must verify the origin of the virus through laboratory experiments. Searching for the 2019-nCoV sequence in snakes would be the first thing to do. \n  \n However, since the outbreak, the seafood market has been disinfected and shut down, which makes it challenging to trace the new virus\u2019 source animal. \n Sampling RNA from animals sold at the market and from wild snakes and bats is needed to confirm the origin of the virus. Nonetheless, the reported findings will also provide insights for developing prevention and treatment protocols. \n The 2019-nCoV outbreak is another reminder that people should limit the consumption of wild animals to prevent zoonotic infections. \n Follow us on Telegram for the latest updates: https://cna.asia/telegram \n Haitao Guo is Professor of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics at the University of Pittsburgh.

What can individuals do in the face of the new coronavirus outbreak? How do you arm yourself in the event that the lung infection from China becomes an epidemic in Europe too? The head of the UK&#39;s Wellcome Trust, the world&#39;s second-richest foundation for the promotion of medical research, tweeted a few days ago: &quot;One thing that would help is to get a flu vaccination.&quot; At first this seems strange. Because a flu vaccination does not protect against infection with the virus called 2019-nCoV, which has been spreading from the city of Wuhan in China and across national borders since the turn of the year. Occasionally it has already been introduced to Europe. In Germany, too, a person was infected with the pathogen. The idea behind Jeremy Farrar&#39;s call for a flu vaccination was a different one: Because the symptoms of real flu (see box) and the lung disease caused by the coronavirus can be similar at the beginning, influenza patients would quickly get to coronavirus in case of doubt. Suspected cases. With all the consequences that would have. They too would then have to be isolated and tested for the pathogen that infected them. Last but not least, those affected would be terrified. In this respect, flu vaccinations could alleviate the pressure on the health system that the new pathogen could exert should it lead to an epidemic in our country as well. In short, the milder the flu season, the fewer additional problems disease fighters would have. The flu caused by the influenza virus usually starts suddenly with a fever, dry cough, muscle pain and / or headache. Other symptoms can include general weakness, sweating, but also nausea / vomiting and diarrhea. The duration of the illness is usually five to seven days. You can see the current flu situation in Germany on the website of the Influenza Working Group. Far from all those infected with influenza get sick as typically. Depending on the severity of the flu season, a few hundred to more than 20,000 people die from flu every year in this country (source: Robert Koch Institute). Infection occurs mainly through droplets, such as those caused by coughing or sneezing. They reach the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract of healthy people over a short distance. In addition, transmission is also possible via hands and surfaces that are contaminated by virus-containing secretions. The Standing Vaccination Commission (STIKO) of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) recommends influenza vaccination for all people over the age of 60, all pregnant women, people with increased health risks (e.g. people with chronic diseases of the respiratory organs, heart or circulatory diseases, liver or Kidney diseases, diabetes or other metabolic diseases, multiple sclerosis, congenital or acquired immunodeficiency) as well as for residents of old people&#39;s or nursing homes. In addition, people with an increased risk (e.g. medical staff) and people who could infect people at risk they care for should be vaccinated. People who come into direct contact with poultry and wild birds should also be vaccinated (the vaccination does not protect against avian flu, but it avoids problematic double infections). The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) sees it similarly, even if its President Lothar Wieler restricted the recommendation to get vaccinated against flu at a press appearance with Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU) on Tuesday to special risk groups. Those for whom the Standing Vaccination Commission (Stiko) of his institute already recommends a flu vaccination should please take advantage of this now, he said. This refers to people over the age of 60, pregnant women, the chronically ill and employees as well as residents of old people&#39;s or nursing homes as well as people at a greatly increased risk of infecting themselves and others with influenza - for example, medical staff or people in facilities with a lot Public traffic. The RKI receives support from politicians. &quot;A flu vaccination always makes sense, that is even more true now,&quot; said the Union&#39;s deputy parliamentary group leader responsible for health policy, Georg Nuesslein (CSU) in an interview with ZEIT ONLINE. The experts would have to decide for themselves whether Stiko should therefore extend its vaccination recommendations to all citizens. &quot;We currently have no reason for coercive measures or interventions of any kind. There is no reason to panic,&quot; stressed N\u00fc\u00dflein. In particular, general practitioners should now make patients more aware of the flu protection. &quot;That also serves the feeling of security and the well-being of the people,&quot; said N\u00fc\u00dflein. At the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organization WHO an accumulation of pneumonia of unknown cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Just a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days later, a group led by virologist Christian Drosten from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers are provisionally calling 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. The Chinese authorities suspect the source of the pathogen to be a food market in Wuhan, where not only fish and seafood but also exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected. Both Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic in 2002 and 2003, around 8,000 people were infected and more than 750 died. Between its discovery in 2012 and the end of 2019, around 2,500 people were infected with the Mers virus, and every third person died from it. In total, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example. Several thousand people have now become ill in China, some of them - most of them probably with previous illnesses - died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first cases of infection outside of China became known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been to Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who was returning from Wuhan, and on January 24, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia, which can be fatal. Since it is a viral disease, antibiotics won&#39;t help. It is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after a dozen or so cases among medical personnel became known. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. As it announced on January 24, the World Health Organization currently expects that an infected person will infect an average of 1.4 to 2.5 other people. If these numbers prove to be true, the virus is less contagious than Sars and so is the flu. The WHO recommends following general hygiene rules: You should wash your hands often and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals. It is not yet possible to say with certainty. The World Health Organization announced on January 28th that around a fifth of the reported cases would become seriously ill from the virus, so if in doubt they would have to be treated in intensive care. According to reports, the first fatalities were patients, some of whom had serious previous illnesses. People with previous illnesses are also particularly at risk from other infectious diseases - such as the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, i.e. change their genetic makeup. That can make them more dangerous to people in the course of an outbreak - but also the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate that is as high as that of the Sars outbreak. His SPD colleague, parliamentary deputy B\u00e4rbel Bas, sees it similarly. &quot;A flu vaccination makes sense. In my opinion, more people should vaccinate,&quot; she told ZEIT ONLINE. However, the politician does not see a reason to expand the flu vaccination recommendation. The effort involved in testing a person suspected of having a coronavirus infection is manageable: &quot;If there are symptoms of an infection with the coronavirus and the person concerned has been in a risk area in China in the last 14 days or has had contact with a sick person, then this person will be tested for the coronavirus while observing hygienic measures such as mouth and nose protection, &quot;said Bas. A test then delivers a result in a few hours and is also sufficiently available in Germany. The test could also be done by people who were in the Chinese province of Hubei - from whose capital Wuhan the pathogen had spread in January - or who had contact with a person who has been known to be infected, even if they did not yet have any symptoms. In general, according to doctors, the best time to get vaccinated is October or November, i.e. before the flu season begins. But even now a vaccination could still make sense, emphasized RKI President Wieler. The time after the turn of the year is generally considered to be the time when there are a particularly high number of flu infections. However, it takes ten to 14 days for the vaccination to develop its protective effect. Of course, people who do not belong to the risk groups can also be vaccinated. Many health insurances - including the three largest, namely Techniker Krankenkasse (TK), German Salaried Health Insurance Fund (DAK) and Barmer Ersatzkasse (BEK) - cover the costs for all those insured who wish to do so. In healthy, young people, the vaccination reduces the risk of catching the flu by 80 percent; in older people, for whom the vaccination is particularly recommended because of the statistically higher risk of death from the infection, it is still 41 to 63 percent. According to the researchers at the RKI, the vaccine prevents around 400,000 influenza illnesses annually in people over 60, despite moderate vaccination rates. Depending on the severity of the flu season and the type of pathogen - which changes every year, which is why the vaccine must always be further developed and re-administered every year - between a few hundred and more than 20,000 people die of flu every year in this country. In 2017/18 there were even 25,100. If you want to protect yourself and others from infection, RKI Vice President Lars Schaade also has a few practical tips beyond vaccinations: Sneeze in your elbows, wash your hands often, keep your distance from people who have a cold. &quot;That protects against influenza and also applies if we should get more cases of the new coronavirus in Germany.&quot; Read more about the new coronavirus here."}, {"content": "Yen holds gains on virus woes, euro crumbles on weak growth outlook.

Train emergency personnel and equip themselves with tools for the rapid diagnosis of patients who may be admitted with the Wuhan coronavirus. This is how the large Spanish hospitals prepare for the outbreak that is stalking China and which has reached nine other countries aboard international flights. It is not the case in Spain for now: the Ministry of Health reported this Friday that two suspected cases under study, people with respiratory ailments recently arrived from Wuhan, have tested negative. But late at night the Basque Country notified that they had a patient with some suspicious symptoms that she was under surveillance and that she had recently visited Wuhan. \u201cWe are following everything with great interest, but also calmly. It is very unlikely that the new virus will become a relevant problem in Spain \u201d, considers Santiago Moreno, head of the infectious diseases service at the Ram\u00f3n y Cajal hospital (Madrid). This position coincides with that held by the ministry. &quot;The population has to have a very low risk perception level,&quot; said Fernando Sim\u00f3n, director of the Center for the Coordination of Health Alerts and Emergencies, in the presentation of the measures agreed by Health and the autonomous communities. Three ideas are the most repeated by the specialists consulted by this newspaper. The first is that what is known about the virus is still little. \u201cWe don&#39;t know the transmissibility rate, which tells us how many people each case infects. Nor do we know if there are asymptomatic cases or with very mild symptoms \u201d, explains Jes\u00fas Rodr\u00edguez Ba\u00f1o, head of the infectious diseases service at the Virgen Macarena hospital (Seville). The second is that, with the available data, the one from Wuhan appears less virulent than the other coronaviruses that have caused epidemic outbreaks since 2002. \u201cMortality is less than 5%, while with SARS and MERS they were much higher [10 % and 35%, respectively] \u201d, says Juan Carlos Gal\u00e1n, spokesman for the Spanish Society of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology (Seimc). In addition, &quot;although transmission from person to person has been demonstrated, it does not seem very high, less than with SARS&quot;, adds Magda Campins, head of Preventive Medicine at the Vall d&#39;Hebron hospital (Barcelona). As a third important idea, the experts conclude that, until the investigations advance and international organizations establish more precise recommendations, it is advisable to &quot;adopt the necessary measures here to be prepared if a case occurs,&quot; says Jos\u00e9 Miguel Cisneros, head of the service. of infectious diseases of the Virgen del Roc\u00edo Hospital. &quot;And rest assured, because our public health system and our hospitals are well prepared to face an episode like this,&quot; he adds. The first measures adopted by hospitals go through &quot;preparing protocols for emergency personnel, which is the gateway to the hospital,&quot; Campins says. &quot;The objective is to determine if the patient suffers symptoms compatible with the virus and if she has recently traveled to Wuhan,&quot; she adds. If both facts coincide, &quot;the patient must be admitted in isolation and the health personnel adopt the usual precautionary measures until it is ruled out or confirmed that the ailment is caused by the virus,&quot; says Rodr\u00edguez Bath. These measures go through &quot;the protection of hands and respiratory barriers, such as masks with a high degree of protection in case there is airborne transmission,&quot; he adds. The instructions finalized by the Ministry of Health and the autonomous communities establish that the samples from all suspected patients will be sent to the National Center for Microbiology (CNM), which will be the reference and will have the results in approximately one day. But large hospitals have a technology, called PCR, that allows progress in diagnosis in a very few hours. &quot;We are acquiring the specific kits to genetically identify the Wuhan virus with PCR,&quot; says Campins. &quot;We have ordered the purchase and they will arrive on Monday,&quot; they explain from Ram\u00f3n y Cajal. Fernando Sim\u00f3n explained on Friday that if a positive case is detected, contacts will be followed up, although the virus does not have &quot;much transmissibility.&quot; On a flight, for example, the evolution of the two passengers sitting next to him would be followed. The goal is for the public network to have the sensitivity to detect cases without blocking the health system. Health does not consider taking exceptional measures at airports for now, since there are no direct flights from Wuhan and it is a measure &quot;that has not proven useful,&quot; according to Sim\u00f3n. He explained that it is very common for passengers who come from long flights to suffer respiratory symptoms, especially in winter, so applying controls to arrivals &quot;would not provide a sufficient benefit.&quot; Health concludes that &quot;it is not very likely, but it may happen&quot; that the virus reaches Spain. &quot;That is why we are prepared to act,&quot; explained Sim\u00f3n, who recalled that the most important thing in these outbreaks is the actions at source and that he considers that quarantines in China reduce the risk."}, {"content": "chinese president xi jinping, under fire, says he led covid-19 fight early on. BEIJING \u2014 Under fire for its response to the coronavirus epidemic, China\u2019s authoritarian government appears to be pushing a new account of events that presents President Xi Jinping as taking early action to fight the outbreak that has convulsed the country. \n But in doing so, authorities have acknowledged for the first time that Mr Xi was aware of the epidemic and involved in the response nearly two weeks before he first spoke publicly about it \u2014 and while officials at its epicentre in the city of Wuhan were still playing down its dangers. \n That new account risks drawing the president, China\u2019s most powerful leader in decades, directly into questions about whether top officials did too little, too late. \n In an internal speech published Saturday, Mr Xi said he had \u201cissued demands about the efforts to prevent and control\u201d the coronavirus Jan 7, during a meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee, the highest council of the Communist Party, whose sessions are typically cloaked in secrecy. \n In the speech, he also said he had authorised the unprecedented lockdown of Wuhan and other cities beginning Jan 23. \n \u201cI have at every moment monitored the spread of the epidemic and progress in efforts to curtail it, constantly issuing oral orders and also instructions,\u201d Mr Xi said of his more recent involvement. \n Mr Xi\u2019s advisers may have hoped that publishing the speech, delivered Feb 3, would dispel speculation about his recent retreat from public view and reassure his people that he can be trusted to lead them out of the epidemic. The virus so far has officially infected more than 68,000 people and killed more than 1,650 worldwide, the vast majority in mainland China. \n \u201cThe overall tone of the speech appears to be defensive,\u201d said Dr Minxin Pei, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College in California. \u201cHe wants to change the narrative, which until this point has been very unfavourable to the top leadership.\u201d \n Delivered at a meeting with top party officials, when the epidemic had already spiraled into a national crisis, the speech could expose Mr Xi to criticism that he didn\u2019t treat the initial threat urgently enough and make it difficult for him to shift blame onto local officials for what many see as the government\u2019s early mishandling of the epidemic. \n The remarks also raise questions about what top leaders knew at the time and what instructions they issued based on that knowledge. \n That Mr Xi convened a meeting of China\u2019s highest political body in early January indicates that the coronavirus was already being seen as a matter of high-level concern \u2014 making his subsequent silence even more conspicuous, experts said. \n An official account of the Jan 7 Standing Committee meeting issued at the time by Xinhua, the state news agency, made no mention of a discussion of the coronavirus. \n \u201cIt seems like he\u2019s trying to indicate that \u2018We weren\u2019t asleep at the wheel,\u2019\u201d said Dr Jude Blanchette, the Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cBut it comes off like, \u2018We knew this was a problem, but we weren\u2019t sounding the alarm.\u2019\u201d \n In the speech this month, Mr Xi signaled his displeasure with lower-level bureaucrats for their \u201cshortcomings\u201d in implementing the party\u2019s top-level directives. \n In early January, officials in Wuhan were giving open assurances that human-to-human transmission of the virus was unlikely. Some government experts agreed. \n \u201cFor now, it seems there is no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission,\u201d Dr Xu Jianguo, a senior expert on communicable diseases at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an interview in early January with Ta Kung Pao, a Hong Kong newspaper. \u201cThis shows that the threat level from this virus is limited.\u201d \n The new information places Mr Xi\u2019s involvement in fighting the epidemic much earlier than was previously known. His earliest public comment on the epidemic came Jan 20, when he gave brief instructions that were published in state media. \n In the days after Mr Xi\u2019s Jan 7 orders were issued, politicians in Wuhan met for the annual meeting of the city\u2019s People\u2019s Congress, its party-controlled legislature. Over that time, the Wuhan health commission\u2019s daily bulletins on the outbreak said repeatedly that there were no new cases of infection, no firm evidence of human-to-human transmission and no infection of medical workers. \n But signs were growing that politicians and government experts underestimated the potency of the new coronavirus. On Jan 9, a 61-year-old man surnamed Zeng died \u2014 the earliest confirmed fatality from the virus. Already, some doctors in Wuhan hospitals were worried enough to warn friends and propose special wards for patients showing symptoms of infection. \n Even after Mr Xi made his first public remarks about the epidemic Jan 20, he mostly kept it at the bottom of his public agenda. On the day before the Chinese New Year holiday began in late January, he took the stage at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing and declared his success in guiding China through a difficult year \u2014 making no mention of the virus that was already spreading fear throughout the country. \n In the days after, he all but disappeared from public view, emerging only a handful of times to preside over Communist Party meetings and to meet foreign visitors, including the director-general of the World Health Organization and Cambodia\u2019s autocratic leader, Mr Hun Sen. \n In the meantime, he directed China\u2019s No. 2 leader, Mr Li Keqiang, to lead the group handling the emergency, effectively turning him into the public face of the response. \n For days, Mr Xi\u2019s absence from public view fueled speculation that he was trying to shield his own reputation by taking a back seat in the fast-unfolding crisis. In the past week, he has returned to centre stage in an apparent effort to swat away such talk. \n This past week, Mr Xi went to a neighbourhood centre in Beijing, a hospital and a centre for disease control in what state media billed as a visit to the \u201cfront line\u201d of China\u2019s efforts to combat the epidemic. He has yet to visit Hubei, the province at the centre of the epidemic. \n A few days later, Mr Xi fired two top Communist Party officials in Hubei, a move intended to calm simmering public anger and contain the political fallout. \n By publishing the Feb 3 speech now, experts said, Mr Xi appears to be staking his reputation on the outcome of the epidemic fight. \n \u201cWhat\u2019s really interesting in the speech is, there\u2019s a lot of the word \u2018I\u2019 in it,\u201d said Dr Blanchette, of Centre for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cThis is clearly putting himself at the centre of Beijing\u2019s response to this while also falling back on the old excuse of blaming cadres for long-standing pathologies of China\u2019s political system.\u201d \n The Feb 3 speech was published by Qiushi, or Seeking Truth, the Communist Party\u2019s top doctrinal journal. It is rare for such an internal speech to be published in full so quickly. THE NEW YORK TIMES"}, {"content": "Breakingviews - Breakdown: Coronavirus goes global. NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - It\u2019s not time to panic, but it is time to face reality. The coronavirus is spreading around the world. China\u2019s unprecedented efforts slowed the spread of the new disease officially known as Covid-19, but that\u2019s merely won some time. Infected people have now been detected on every continent except Antarctica. Competent and open government is the best defense against hospitals and society being overwhelmed. But nations will probably have to deal with recurring outbreaks.\nNo. China helped reduce transmission by shutting down public gatherings, factories, and schools. Mass testing is also key to figure out who has the disease, and track who may have been exposed. China now claims the number of new cases is falling. While the country\u2019s official statistics are notoriously unreliable, it makes sense such methods would slow the spread of the disease which has afflicted more than 78,000 people in the People\u2019s Republic and killed around 2,700.\nWhile the World Health Organization has declined to call it a pandemic \u2013 a deadly disease which is spreading worldwide \u2013 the cat is out of the bag. Cases have been found in 50 countries, and the list is rapidly growing. On Wednesday the number of new cases reported outside China exceeded those inside the country for the first time since the disease was identified in early December.\nWhat\u2019s especially alarming is that one of the first indications of a mass outbreak in Iran came from a traveler being diagnosed in Canada. If countries that appear uninfected are spreading the disease, many other outbreaks are presumably underway. Nearly every country neighboring Iran has now been affected.\nFor a disease to be truly worrisome, it needs to be both highly contagious and dangerous. Ebola has caused a lot of suffering in central Africa, but the disease often kills its victims before they can infect many others. The odds of it spreading widely are therefore low.\nBy comparison the 2009 flu \u2013 the last pandemic \u2013 spread all over the earth but was surprisingly mild. America\u2019s Centers for Disease Control estimates over 60 million Americans were stricken. It swamped medical offices, workplaces were short-staffed, and schools emptied. But it only killed about one out of every 5,000 people who were infected.\nThe new coronavirus appears to spread easily. The experience of the Diamond Princess cruise ship suggests it can be explosive. Out of 3,700 passengers and crew, there have been about 700 confirmed cases and that number continues to rise. More broadly, cases outside China are more than doubling every week. It\u2019s also dangerous. The estimated death rate for Covid-19 is about 2%, making it about 20 times deadlier than typical influenza.\nHealthcare systems aren\u2019t designed to deal with pandemics, because they are so unusual. The United States has about 900,000 hospital beds, about two-thirds of which are occupied on average according to the CDC. The World Health Organization estimates about 80% of coronavirus cases are mild, with others serious or critical. So if just 1% of America\u2019s population of 330 million contracted the virus at the same time, there wouldn\u2019t be enough hospital beds. An uneven outbreak could lead to more overcrowding in some cities and critical-care units.\nHospitals would probably run short of protective gear. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has said the government has stockpiled 30 million masks, but it needs 300 million to protect front-line healthcare workers alone. Doctors would be overloaded, because many would become sick, and because people who have not been infected would still seek help.\nStretched medical systems will kill more patients. This dynamic helps explain why the death rate in the city of Wuhan, the center of the outbreak, has been higher than in other parts of China. Countries with poor medical care will be hit harder. They lack the ability to find clusters of disease and dampen the outbreak, while patients won\u2019t be treated.\nClosed factories and housebound consumers have already depressed Chinese economic activity. Companies ranging from Apple to Yum China have warned of supply chain issues and decreased demand. These will cascade as more countries embrace drastic measures. Japan on Thursday closed all its schools early ahead of an upcoming spring break.\nIt\u2019s notable that three of the four flu pandemics in the past century were followed shortly by U.S. recessions. The exception was the 2009 outbreak, which occurred when the world economy was already in the dumps. Closed factories and offices reduce output, restaurants and cinemas suffer revenue shortfalls, corporate debt weighs heavier, while small businesses may fail if the owner falls sick or dies.\nThe World Bank estimated in 2014 that a pandemic of similar size and effect to the 1918 flu would knock 5% off global gross domestic product. That disease was both widespread and probably more virulent \u2013 it killed over 50 million people \u2013 so that\u2019s a worst-case scenario.\nAllowing information to flow freely is the best way to identify clusters early. When local officials cover up, or doctors are afraid to disclose cases, outbreaks fester. The epidemics in China and Iran probably would have been caught and acted upon earlier in less authoritarian countries.\nMeasures such as shutting down society or closing borders can slow transmission, but can\u2019t be sustained for months on end. Democratic societies may not allow the kind of intensive surveillance China has practiced. Workers and businesses can only go so long before the financial crunch becomes unbearable. China is now revving back up, and that will almost certainly result in more infections.\nMass testing of the exposed and isolating the sick can be sustained and might keep clusters manageable. But this requires a functioning system with competent leadership. South Korea said on Wednesday that over 20,000 people were being tested. The United States has not started surveillance and has only been testing about a dozen people a day. That means undetected outbreaks are probably underway.\nPast pandemics have spread in waves. The virus may propagate more effectively when the weather is cold and dry. Behavior changes too; people wash their hands more often when evidence of sickness is around them. As the proportion of the population with immunity rises, the disease spreads more slowly. However, immunity may wane over time. The most likely outcome is that the disease becomes endemic with smaller outbreaks following the initial flare.\nSeveral anti-viral medicines and vaccines are already being tested. Showing efficacy, safety and scaling up production will take time, though. A drug to treat the coronavirus probably won\u2019t be widely available for at least a year; developing a vaccine will take longer. In the meantime, the world can only prepare for the worst, while hoping for the best."}, {"content": "hundreds of americans flown home from cruise ship, 14 with coronavirus. SHANGHAI/TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. - More than 300 American cruise liner passengers, including 14 who tested positive for coronavirus, were flown home to military bases in the United States, after two weeks under quarantine off Japan.  \n The cruise ship Diamond Princess, with more than 400 cases by far the largest cluster outside China, has become the biggest test so far of other countries' ability to contain an outbreak that has killed 1,770 people in China and five elsewhere.  \n Ground crew in anti-contamination suits met a chartered jet that touched down at Joint Base San Antonio in Texas, and passengers could be seen climbing down the stairs wearing face masks in the pre-dawn mist. Another flight landed at Travis Air Force Base in California hours earlier. Those arriving were taken into a two-week quarantine.  \n Although U.S. officials said passengers with coronavirus symptoms would not be taken, 14 passengers found at the last minute to have tested positive were permitted to board the planes. The U.S. State Department said the infected passengers were kept in isolation on the flights.  \n Across mainland China, officials said the total number of coronavirus cases rose by 2,048 to 70,548. That was slightly more new cases than were reported on Sunday, but hundreds fewer than reported on Saturday.  \n Chinese authorities say the stabilisation in the number of new cases is a sign that measures they have taken to halt the spread of the disease are having an effect.  \n However, epidemiologists say it is probably still too early to say how well the outbreak is being contained within China and its central Hubei province, where the virus first appeared. Official figures of new cases have levelled off in the past, only to jump suddenly after changes in methodology.  \n China has responded to the COVID-19 virus by locking down Hubei's provincial capital Wuhan, a megacity of 11 million people, and imposing restrictions in a number of other cities.  \n But the ruling Communist Party is also under pressure to prevent the economy from crashing and get people back to work.  \n China's central bank cut the interest rate on its medium-term lending, a move that is expected to pave the way for a reduction in the benchmark loan prime rate on Thursday. Beijing has also announced plans for cuts in taxes and fees.  \n Even so, economists expect China's economic growth to slow. Ratings agency Moody's on Monday lowered its 2020 GDP growth forecast to 5.2%, making it likely China would miss a goal to double GDP over the decade to 2020.  \n  \n CRUISE SHIPS  \n Around half of all known cases of the virus outside China have been found aboard the Diamond Princess, where around 400 people have tested positive since the cruise liner was ordered to stay under quarantine off Japan on Feb. 3.  \n Several other countries have announced plans to follow the United States in bringing passengers home. Around half of the 3,700 passengers and crew are Japanese.  \n Matthew Smith, an American passenger who remained on the ship after refusing to board the voluntary repatriation flights, tweeted that staying behind was the \"best decision ever\".  \n \"US Gov't said they would not put anyone on the planes who was symptomatic, and they ended up knowingly and intentionally putting on 14 people who actually have the virus,\" he wrote.  \n Authorities around the world were also trying to track down passengers from another cruise liner, the Westerdam, which was turned away from ports across Southeast Asia for two weeks before docking in Cambodia on Thursday.  \n One American passenger who disembarked in Cambodia tested positive for the virus in Malaysia on Saturday.  \n Carnival Corp., which operates both cruise liners, said it was cooperating with authorities in trying to trace other passengers from the Westerdam. None of the other 1,454 passengers and 802 crew had reported any symptoms, it said.  \n \"Guests who have already returned home will be contacted by their local health department and be provided further information,\" a statement from the company's Holland America Line unit said. Hundreds of passengers are still in Cambodia, either on the ship or in hotels.  \n \"We will all be tested for the coronavirus today and tomorrow by the Cambodian Ministry of Health,\" said passenger Holley Rauen, a public health nurse and midwife from Fort Myers, Florida. \"We have no idea when we get to get home.\"  \n  \n CHINA BACK TO WORK?  \n After an extended Lunar New Year holiday, China needs to get back to work or suffer severe economic consequences. There is a proposal to delay the opening of the annual session of parliament, due on Feb. 24.  \n Some cities remain in lockdown, streets are deserted, employees are nervous, and travel bans and quarantine orders are in place around the country. Many factories have yet to re-open, disrupting supply chains in China and beyond.  \n In Japan, where data showed on Monday that the economy had already shrunk last quarter at the fastest pace in almost six years, the impact of the virus is expected to show up in the current quarter, stoking fears of recession.  \n Trade-dependent Singapore downgraded its 2020 economic growth forecast and has said recession is possible. It is set to unveil measures to cushion the blow on Tuesday.  \n Organisers of the Tokyo Marathon have decided to limit the March 1 race to top-level athletes, banning 38,000 general participants, a person with knowledge of the issue told Reuters.  \n Japan's Imperial Household Agency said it would cancel Emperor Naruhito's public birthday address on Feb. 23, his first since his coronation last year. The event regularly attracts tens of thousands of people to the inner grounds of the Imperial Palace in the heart of Tokyo.

The outbreak, it adds, &quot;originated in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei province&quot;, with &quot;hundreds of cases in different regions of China (Wuhan, Guangdong, Beijing, Shanghai) and imported situations in Thailand, Japan and in South Korea&quot;. Macau authorities also announced today that the first case of the virus was identified in the territory, while Hong Kong said it had detected a suspicious case, but whose confirmation will only be definitive on Thursday.

The ministry recalls that the diplomatic representation of Portugal in China is ensured by the embassy of Portugal in Beijing and states that, in case of emergency, contact the number +86 186 1208 7488. The virus was initially detected, last month, in Wuhan, city in central China, an important domestic and international transport hub. The number of cases has risen rapidly, with currently 440 confirmed cases, according to the deputy director of the National Health Commission of China. Nine people died, all in Hubei Province, whose capital is Wuhan. Outside China, cases of the new coronavirus have been confirmed in South Korea, the United States, Japan, Thailand, Taiwan and today in Macau. The cases fuel fears about a potential epidemic, similar to that of SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which between 2002 and 2003 killed 650 people in mainland China and Hong Kong. The outbreak comes at a time when millions of Chinese travel, on the occasion of the Lunar New Year, the main celebration of Chinese families, equivalent to Christmas in Western countries.

Hours later, state media in neighbouring Huanggang, a city of some 6 million people, said it was imposing a similar lockdown.\nChinese authorities gave no new details on the numbers of virus infections but it has been reported in Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong, and several other countries including the United States, stoking fears it is already spreading worldwide.\nWuhan's city government said it would shut down all urban transport networks and suspend outgoing flights from 10 a.m. (0200 GMT). Domestic media said some airlines were operating after the deadline, however. State media broadcast images of one of Wuhan's transport hubs, the Hankou rail station, nearly deserted, with gates blocked or barred.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has raised the risk of contagion and impact of the new coronavirus to \u201cvery high globally\u201d. In a press conference, the director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the outbreak that already affected this Friday close to 60 countries is increasing. With many questions still unanswered, the main concern of various countries is trying to stop the transmission of the virus and find a possible cure or specific treatment. Ghebreyesus said it would be a &quot;big, big mistake&quot; to abandon the new coronavirus mitigation strategy, adding that each country must make &quot;aggressive containment&quot;. The director-general of WHO added that more than 20 vaccines are being developed and that there are already some clinical trials underway. Expect results in the coming weeks. 23 million extra budget Since the beginning of the crisis, Germany has 48 cases (until this Friday), of which 18 have already recovered. Until this afternoon there was no record of deaths. The German Ministry of Health has permanently updated information on its website. A special budget was created to deal with the outbreak: 23 million euros for measures of prevention, communication and repatriation of citizens, among others. In terms of prevention, the rules are these: people who have been in countries or areas at risk (the identification of these is the responsibility, in Germany, of the Robert Koch Institute) must avoid, &quot;regardless of having symptoms&quot;, &quot;unnecessary&quot; contacts with other people and should \u201cstay at home whenever possible\u201d. If they develop symptoms, they should go to the doctor, taking care to notify him beforehand, by telephone, providing information about the countries visited, continues the ministry. The risk zones are: China, South Korea, Iran and Italy. Passengers coming from China, Hong Kong and Macau must, even on the plane, fill in a document with information on where they will stay in Germany for the next 30 days, giving their contact details so that they can be found in cases where any case arises. traveled together. They also have to report where they have been in China and what health conditions they are in. All traveler information must be made available by airlines to the German health authorities. Airplane pilots are instructed to communicate the health status of passengers before landing. Any suspicious case must be reported so that there is a doctor at the airport who must board the plane, examine the traveler in question and decide what to do. The same rules should apply to trains and buses crossing land borders. Germany will &quot;continue to try to isolate people as much as possible, treat them in clinics and provide care to potential contact persons,&quot; Health Minister Jens Spahn said this week. There have already been precautionary measures, such as the closing of schools and cr\u00e8ches in a town, Heinsberg, in North Rhine-Westphalia, whose authorities ordered a domestic quarantine for all people (between 300 and 400, according to different media) that participated in a Carnival event this month. These people may be asked for blood samples. This is after it has been confirmed that a couple who attended that party is infected. Other cases, 14 in total, confirmed on Thursday in Heinsberg, do not need hospitalization but remain isolated in their homes. People without symptoms should lead a \u201cnormal life\u201d The Spanish government recommends a normal life for all people, even those returning from risk areas. Spain registered 34 positive cases until 4:25 pm yesterday, two of which have already been discharged. a 77-year-old man was in serious condition. And even with these cases all confirmed, the recommendations are similar to those in Portugal. Those arriving from risk zones, which Spain considers to be those of mainland China, Singapore, Hong-Kong, Japan, South Korea, Iran and Italy (Lombardy, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna and Piamonte regions) and is in good health, should lead a \u201cnormal life, with family, with friends and, in general, in the school and work environment\u201d If, within 14 days of arrival, they develop respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough and feeling short of breath, \u201cthey must stay at home and contact the health services\u201d through the Spanish telephone line that exists for this purpose. risk zones, the Spanish government recommends \u201cnot traveling to the affected areas unless strictly necessary\u201d. There are no quarantine measures active in Spain at the moment. There was a situation in a hotel in Tenerife where positive cases were identified, but these people have already left the hotel and returned to their homes. The Spanish Public Health department maintains &quot;level one&quot; of containment, of three possible levels. And is only considering raising this level, which could lead to tighter measures if &quot;uncontrolled community transmission&quot; occurs. Spaniards will consider opting for \u201cbasic social distancing measures such as reducing agglomerations of people.\u201d But, for now, this is just a hypothetical scenario. infected so far, 21 dead, close to 50 people recovered. A special website has been created where information about coronaviruses is updated daily. It recalls the decree of 21 February which mandates, for example, that all people who have been recently in areas of China affected by the epidemic, they are obliged to communicate this fact to the health authorities. measures with similar effectiveness were chosen\u201d. Since January 30, flights to mainland China, Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan have been suspended, by order of the Minister of Health. There are also specific measures in different regions. Since Northern Italy became the number one focus in Europe, the country has taken drastic measures. Eleven cities with a total of 55,000 people are in quarantine. Schools, universities and cinemas were closed and several public events cancelled, such as the official celebrations of the Carnival in Venice or the Book Fair in Bologna. Lombardy&#39;s Italian region announced this Friday that it will extend for another week the emergency measures adopted to try to contain the outbreak of the new coronavirus that affects the region - including closing schools and banning public gatherings. A resident of San Fiorano, one of the quarantine cities, told the BBC this Friday that it is no longer mandatory to wear a mask in supermarkets, that the situation is calm, but that the streets remain almost deserted. Volunteers ensure the supply of food and medicine to older (or sick) people who cannot leave their homes. To \u201cavoid the suspension\u201d of companies and production centers, the February 21st decree allows companies and employees to opt for \u201cremote work\u201d until March 15th in six regions of Northern Italy (but companies can reject the measure \u201c for organizational reasons\u201d). Italian public administration officials can also resort to this type of work. Parental leave to keep children In France, precautionary measures included the cancellation of events such as the Nice carnival and an international trade fair in Paris. The government decided to suspend all school trips to and from areas where the virus circulates: mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, South Korea and the Italian regions of Lombardy and Veneto. Children and young people returning from these areas must not go to school for the next 14 days. Parents of these children will benefit from a 20-day paid leave with a medical certificate. In the case of working adults, the Government determines that during the 14 days following the return from the risk areas, these people work from home if they are in good health. But if their isolation is determined or if they have to remain at home, they immediately receive compensation for 20 days of work. The French advise all people returning from risky areas to wear a mask. The use of a mask is only recommended in these cases or if people are sick. At Paris-Charles de Gaulle and Saint-Denis de la R\u00e9union airports, passengers from China, Hong Kong and Macau are met by a Civil Protection team that is in contact with the medical service at the airports concerned. Recommendations for those isolated at home About 9,000 people have been tested until this Friday, in the United Kingdom, but only 20 cases were positive, according to the Ministry of Health in a statement this Friday. The government has warned of the dangers of overreacting in response to an epidemic and is increasing the number of tests even for people who have not traveled to risk zones in Italy, Iran or China and who have no symptoms. Official guidelines are that those who have returned from 11 quarantined Italian cities stay in isolation at home. The same applies to what arrived in the last days of Iran and certain areas of South Korea. Avoid contacting other people and calling the National Health Service lines are the recommendations. But measures like border closures are out of the question for now. &quot;If you look at Italy, they have stopped all flights from China and they are now the worst-affected country in Europe,&quot; Health Secretary Matt Hancock said this week. Those who present symptoms should remain at home, isolated, while they do not have the test results. There are a number of recommendations for these people (for example, there is special care to be taken with the household waste of these patients, which should be properly packed and not placed outside for collection until it is certain that the person is not infected; people they must stay in a room with a window to the outside and the door closed...). On February 10, the Government announced the \u201cstrengthening of legal powers to protect public health\u201d. And it is possible to order the isolation of individuals if there is a well-founded reason for doing so. There is monitoring of passengers at airports (for those coming from China), a special team was placed at Heathrow airport to support those arriving and not feeling well, in addition to doctors who are on call at all airports in the country. On Thursday a school closed in Derbyshire after a case among the guardians was confirmed. A medical center was also closed not far away because of another confirmed case, the BBC reported.

As of March 28, less than three months after the world was made aware of the novel coronavirus, 600,000 people across 177 countries/regions have been infected with it. The infection which reportedly originated from a market in Wuhan city in the Chinese province of Hubei, has claimed more than 27,800 lives.\nWith nations entering lockdown in an effort to 'flatten the curve' of social interactions by means of social distancing, it is very important to refrain from placing one's beliefs in any miraculous cures or conspiracy theories about COVID-19. Here are some widely shared myths about the novel coronavirus that stand nowhere on the scale of scientific relevance.\nThis is a myth. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has observed that this infection can be transmitted in any and all areas regardless of climate.\nThis is not true. While wearing a mask in a crowded place is advisable, the mask cannot prevent transmission of the novel coronavirus. In some cases where the person wearing the mask touches an infected surface before touching his/her face to re-adjust the mask, this protective gear could lead to infection, said the Director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Dr Randeep Guleria.\nThis is a myth. The normal body temperature remains stable between 36.5\u00b0C to 37\u00b0C despite the temperature of one's bath, says the WHO.\nThere is no evidence whatsoever to prove this claim. While alcohol-based hand sanitizers are a recommended precaution against any virus, drinking alcohol while seeking to cure Covid-19 is the same as drinking alcohol-based hand sanitizer and expecting it to taste like a pint of beer.\nIt has been established that the novel coronavirus jumped species from an animal to a man and is originally a zoonotic disease. However, no known animal species has been known to carry this virus as of yet and medical experts have asked people not to believe in rumours and eat non-vegetarian meals as long as they are prepared with utmost care for hygiene.\nThis is a myth. Dr Faheem Younus, the Chief of Infectious Diseases at the University of Maryland says that a person infected with the novel coronavirus can also hold his/her breath for longer than 10 seconds. On the other hand, the elderly will not be able to accomplish this task but it does not in any way mean that they are infected.\nDirector of AIIMS, Dr Randeep Guleria says that one should not visit a hospital during a pandemic since it increases the chances of a healthy person catching the virus. One should consult a doctor over the phone if he/she is experiencing any symptoms at all and seek future course of action.\nThis is a myth. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that the consumption of garlic boosts the immunity system or safeguards one from being infected with Covid-19.\nThis is untrue. One should not donate blood at a time like this unless and until one is absolutely sure that he/she is not infected.\nThis is a myth. No study or research has shown that mosquitoes can act as carriers of the novel coronavirus. \"The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose,\" says WHO.\nThese are myths. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), one should regularly wash one's hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. Apart from this, neither a hand dryer nor an ultraviolet disinfection lamp can kill the virus.\nThis is a myth. Pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine cannot protect anyone from Covid-19 since the vaccine for the new coronavirus is yet to be discovered.\nThis is untrue. While some preliminary research has shown that the novel coronavirus remains on certain surfaces such as cardboard for some time, it cannot spread through parcels received from China.\nThis is not entirely true. A thermal scanner detects body temperature and is great for identifying someone with a high fever, however, medical experts and doctors treating Covid-19 patients have said that initial research shows how people who display no symptoms can also be infected with the virus.\nThis is untrue. The transmission of novel coronavirus has been seen in people of all ages. Doctors suggest that people with co-morbid conditions such as blood pressure, heart or respiratory diseases are at a higher risk if they get infected with Covid-19. However, a perfectly healthy person can also be infected in the presence of a Covid-19 patient."}, {"content": "novel coronavirus outbreak raises spectre of sars. Many have drawn parallels between the current novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemic and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak in 2002 and 2003. \n It would be difficult not to. \n Both outbreaks are caused by novel animal coronaviruses that ended up infecting humans. Both originated in China, can cause severe human disease and have resulted in deaths. Both have been declared \u201cpublic health emergencies of international concern\u201d by the World Health Organization (WHO). \n But there are significant differences between the two outbreaks and let\u2019s guard against seeing the 2019-nCoV from an old lens. \n First, let\u2019s consider why Sars is deeply entrenched in many Singaporeans\u2019 psyche. \n The Sars outbreak was a seminal event for Singapore and its healthcare system in particular. While the 238 cases and 33 deaths here between March and July 2003 may seem small when compared to most other serious medical conditions, Sars caused considerable fear and uncertainty among the people, with outsized economic and public health impact. \n These include the ramifications from the closure of Tan Tock Seng Hospital \u2014\u00a0a large general hospital \u2014\u00a0to non-Sars patients for almost three months. \n Then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong described the Sars epidemic as a \u201cdefining moment\u201d for Singapore. \n While WHO had praised Singapore for its exemplary handling of the epidemic, the outbreak also highlighted how unprepared our country was for a novel respiratory virus outbreak. \n In its aftermath, fundamental changes to hospitals and outbreak management in our country were made that have been extensively described elsewhere. \n As a result, Singapore is now far more prepared for 2019-nCoV and other epidemics compared to 2003. \n The collective psychological impact and institutional memory of Sars has meant that we have a tendency to view each new epidemic through the lens of the Sars experience. \n When the pandemic influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus appeared on the horizon in April 2009, the initial planning in Singapore that I could observe revolved around containing the disease \u2014\u00a0early detection of infected persons for hospitalisation and prolonged isolation, as well as quarantining their contacts. \n This was triggered when the first patient in Singapore was diagnosed in May 2009. \n However, the pandemic influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus \u2014\u00a0like all influenza viruses \u2014\u00a0is a markedly different beast compared to the Sars coronavirus (Sars-CoV). \n It spreads far more easily in the community, and poses a far lower risk of death. \n Fewer than one per thousand will die after being infected by influenza compared to slightly more than one in 10 persons infected with Sars. \n What this means is that pandemic influenza could never have been contained in Singapore, but the consequences of failing was not dire. \n The Ministry of Health (MOH) stepped down control measures for the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus over a short few months and changed its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition alert level to green (normal) in February 2010, by which time an estimated several hundred thousand had been infected by flu. \n Doctors and public health professionals also believe the influence A (H1N1)pdm09 virus caused more deaths than Sars. \n Did the initial measures slow down the spread of the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus in Singapore sufficiently so that the healthcare system was not overwhelmed and people had time to be socialised to the idea that the pandemic was not worse than the usual seasonal flu? \n We do not know the answers to these questions. \n Fast forward to today, and it is clear now that there are crucial differences between Sars and the current coronavirus outbreak that started in Wuhan as well. \n During its approximate nine-month course, Sars infected 8,096 persons \u2014\u00a05,327 in mainland China \u2014\u00a0and resulted in 774 deaths. \n A significant proportion of its spread occurred in hospitals (40.8 per cent in Singapore). Within a third of that time, the 2019-nCoV has infected as of Feb 3 over 16,000 persons \u2014\u00a0more than 98 per cent of whom are in China \u2014\u00a0and resulted in over 300 deaths. \n Almost the entirety of its spread has been in the community. Part of the heightened case count is due to timing. \n The Wuhan outbreak occurred just before Chinese New Year, a period where the largest human migration on earth occurs. \n The world is also far more connected today than in 2003. However, it is also apparent now that the novel coronavirus is more infectious\u00a0than the Sars-CoV, with several family or travel clusters among those diagnosed overseas. \n Asymptomatic infections have been reported, which did not happen with Sars-CoV, with Germany reporting a plausible case of asymptomatic transmission of the virus. \n The silver lining is that the 2019-nCoV appears far less deadly compared to the Sars-CoV. \n The case fatality rate of the 2019-nCoV is currently estimated to be around 2 per cent (i.e. 2 out of every 100 infected will die), although the actual figure might be lower depending on the number of persons with mild disease who did not present to a healthcare facility and were thus undiagnosed. \n So currently the 2019-nCoV is shaping up to look less like Sars-CoV, and more like a virulent form of the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus, although more data is required before we can be completely certain. \n One important lesson is that the initial information obtained at the start of epidemics is incomplete and can be misleading. \n In early January 2020, there was little to suggest that the 2019-nCoV was different from the Sars and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronaviruses in terms of how it spreads and the severity of infection. \n Similarly, the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus\u00a0was initially believed to be as deadly as the Spanish flu of 1918, which was estimated to have wiped out between 3 and 5 per cent of the human population. \n Within a few short weeks, however, sufficient information became available for a more concrete re-assessment in both 2009 and 2020. \n We do not know at present whether the 2019-nCoV epidemic can be contained. \n China has instituted incredible control measures \u2014\u00a0in effect virtually quarantining an entire province \u2014\u00a0that would be unthinkable anywhere else in the world. \n However, the virus has already spread to more than 25 countries worldwide, including several that will not be able to mount as robust a response as China and other high-income countries should community spread occur. \n It is likely that the threat of 2019-nCoV will be present far longer than the nine months of Sars, while an effective vaccine will take far longer than a year to become commercially available. \n It is useful to look at the 2019-nCoV outbreak not through the lens of Sars, but entirely on its own characteristics and calibrate measures and policies towards minimising impact and living life as normally as possible during this period. \n \u00a0 \n ABOUT THE AUTHOR:\u00a0\u00a0 \n Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang heads the Infectious Diseases Programme and is co-director of the Leadership Institute for Global Health Transformation at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore."}, {"content": "budget 2020: s$5.6 billion special packages to support firms, workers and households amid covid-19 outbreak. SINGAPORE \u2014 Amid expectations of a substantial package to help Singapore cope with the Covid-19 outbreak, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat unveiled during this year\u2019s Budget statement not one, but two special packages totalling S$5.6 billion to help firms and workers, as well as households. \n The packages dwarf the S$230 million package introduced during the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) crisis in 2003, and significantly exceed analysts\u2019 expectations. \n They comprise a S$4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package which will \u201cstabilise the economy and support our workers and enterprises\u201d, as Mr Heng put it, and a S$1.6 billion Care and Support Package to help households with cost of living. \n The special packages come on the back of lacklustre economic growth last year \u2014 0.7 per cent, the weakest since the 2008 global financial crisis. \n On Monday, the Ministry of Trade and Industry downgraded its economic growth forecast to between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, down from 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. \n In his Budget speech on Tuesday (Feb 18), Mr Heng, who is also Finance Minister, noted that Covid-19 hit Singapore \u201cjust as the global economy was beginning to recover\u201d. \n \u201cThe outbreak will certainly impact our economy,\u201d said Mr Heng, adding that this is especially so since Singapore\u2019s economy is now much more integrated with the economy of China, where the virus originated.\u00a0 \n The Government is monitoring the situation and it is ready to do more if necessary\u00a0to help Singaporeans cope with the economic impact, Mr Heng reiterated.\u00a0 \n Comprising broad-based measures, the two packages will also feature targeted support, with the less well-off and industries more impacted by the outbreak getting more help. \n \u00a0 \n  \n BROAD-BASED HELP FOR FIRMS, WORKERS  \n JOBS SUPPORT SCHEME  \n Under the Stabilisation and Support Package, a S$1.3 billion Jobs Support Scheme will be rolled out to benefit all enterprises and their local employees which total more than 1.9 million people. The Government will pay for 8 per cent of the wages of these workers, up to a monthly cap of S$3,600 for three months, said Mr Heng. \n This scheme will help businesses retain Singapore workers and will be given to employers by the end of July. The measures are directed toward Singaporean citizens and permanent residents, as well as both full-time and part-time hires. \n ENHANCED WAGE CREDIT SCHEME \n The Wage Credit Scheme currently co-funds wage increases for Singaporean employees earning a gross monthly wage of up to S$4,000. \n The cap will be raised to S$5,000 for qualifying wage increases given in 2019 and 2020. The Government will also co-fund five percentage points more, raising the levels to 20 per cent for wage raises in 2019 and 15 per cent for those in 2020. \n The enhancement will cost the Government another S$1.1 billion, benefitting 90,000 enterprises and more than 700,000 Singaporean employees, Mr Heng said. \n OTHER INITIATIVES  \n A corporate income tax rebate at the rate of 25 per cent of tax payable, capped at S$15,000 per firm, will also help all tax-paying companies in Singapore. This will cost the Government S$400 million. \n \u201cWe will also support tenants and lessees of government-managed properties,\u201d said Mr Heng. \n Tenants and lessees under the JTC Corporation, the Housing and Development Board (HDB), the Singapore Land Authority, the Singapore Tourism Board and the Sentosa Development Corporation will receive help with rent, including more flexible rental payments. \n Firms can apply to the relevant agencies which will assess each request individually. \n Several tax treatments under the corporate tax system will also be enhanced for one year, such as allowing a faster write-down of investments in plant and machinery, renovation, and refurbishment under the 2021 year of assessment. \n \u201cThis will put more cash in the hands of our enterprises. For example, hotels can now take advantage of this lull period to carry out upgrading work, and be better prepared for the rebound,\u201d said Mr Heng. \n To help enterprises access working capital more easily, the working capital loan component under the Enterprise Financing Scheme will be boosted for one year, with the maximum loan quantum doubled to S$600,000. \n The Government will also bear greater risks for these loans, with its share of risk upped to 80 per cent from the current range of 50 to 70 per cent. \n \u201cWith the large part of the risk taken up by the Government, I trust that our financial institutions will do their part to support our viable SMEs (small- and medium-sized enterprises),\u201d said Mr Heng. \n TARGETED HELP FOR SECTORS DIRECTLY HIT BY OUTBREAK  \n Additional help will be given to sectors directly affected by the outbreak \u2014 tourism, aviation, food services and retail, as well as point-to-point transport sectors. \n These sectors will be given help to retain and reskill workers. The funding period for reskilling workers through redeployment programmes under the Manpower Ministry\u2019s Adapt and Grow initiative will be increased to a maximum of six months. \n Said Mr Heng: \u201cTogether with the Jobs Support Scheme, we will support employers in these sectors to retain and train more than 330,000 local workers. These workers can make full use of the down time for training and upskilling to prepare for the recovery.\u201d \n For the tourism sector, a property tax rebate of 30 per cent will be granted this year to accommodation and function room components of licensed hotels and serviced apartments, as well as venues for Mice (meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions). \n International cruise and regional ferry terminals will receive a 15 per cent property tax rebate, while integrated resorts will get a 10 per cent tax rebate. \n A temporary bridging loan programme for the tourism sector will also be rolled out for a year, with a loan quantum of up to S$1 million and interest rates capped at 5 per cent. The Government will also bear 80 per cent of the risk of the loan. \n The aviation sector will benefit from a range of measures, including a 15 per cent property tax rebate for Changi Airport, as well as rebates on aircraft landing and parking charges, assistance for ground handling agents and rental rebates for shops and cargo agents at Changi Airport. \n A Transport Ministry spokesperson said that the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on Singapore\u2019s aviation industry has been significant, with more than 80 per cent of all scheduled flights between Singapore and mainland China cancelled. \n \u201cThere are now fewer than 80 services per week, compared with over 400 prior to the outbreak. Passenger traffic has dropped,\u201d said the spokesperson, who added that traffic to Singapore from other regions has also started to decline. \n Food services and retail businesses will also receive rental waivers or rebates. Tenants at National Environment Agency-managed hawker centres and markets will get a full-month of rent waived, and other Government agencies such as HDB will provide a half-month rent waiver to their commercial tenants. \n Those that operate out of private properties will also not be left out \u2014 landlords will be granted a 15 per cent property tax rebate for commercial properties that qualify. \n \u201cI strongly urge landlords to pass this on to their tenants by reducing rentals,\u201d Mr Heng said. \n For the point-to-point transport sector, which include taxi operators and private hire car firms, Mr Heng noted that the Transport Ministry had recently announced a support package for these businesses. Many firms in this sector have come forward to support the initiative by matching the Government\u2019s contribution, he added. \n Said Mr Heng: \u201cThis spirit of partnership is what we need to weather this challenging period together.\u201d \n More details of the various measures will be revealed in the upcoming debates into the respective ministries\u2019 budgets. \n Mr Heng added that he will elaborate on the S$1.6 billion Care and Support Package in the later part of his speech. \n S$800M BOOST FOR FRONTLINE AGENCIES \n Separately, apart from the two special packages, another S$800 million will be injected to support the frontline agencies dealing with the outbreak. The bulk of the amount will be channelled to the Ministry of Health. \n \u201cThis is on top of the substantial resources already committed each year to public health,\u201d said Mr Heng, who then thanked all frontline officers who have been working tirelessly to fight against the outbreak \u2014 prompting other members of the House to thump\u00a0their armrests in support.\u00a0 \n Paying tribute to the group, he said: \u201cYou exemplify the resilience and indomitable spirit of our people. But please take care of yourselves. I am confident that together, we will stay strong and get through these trying times.\u201d"}, {"content": "Malaysia's fourth-quarter GDP growth seen slowing to weakest in 3-1\\/2 years: Reuters poll. KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia\u2019s economic growth in the fourth quarter is expected to have slowed to its weakest since mid-2016 on weaker private consumption and external demand, a Reuters poll showed.\nThe median forecast from the poll of 13 economists was for growth of 4.2% in October-December compared with a year earlier, the slowest pace since the second quarter of 2016.

If you go into the abysses of the right-wing to right-wing extremist US media landscape these days, it seems as if their propagandists have only been waiting for an event like the corona pandemic. Ben Shapiro, editor-in-chief of the Daily Wire and Podcaster website, warned a few days ago on his show that in the future a virus would break out in China &quot;every four or five years&quot; and that it would therefore by no means be racist if Donald Trump found the corona virus &quot; call the Chinese virus &quot;. A week earlier, the ultra-conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh said on his show: &quot;Nothing beats the destruction of the entire US economy by a bio-threat from China, right?&quot; And then there is Stephen Bannon, Trump&#39;s former chief strategist and ex-head of the white supremacy platform Breitbart. In his War Room podcast, which Bannon has been running since October last year, almost everything has been about Corona since the end of January, Bannon has established its own format for this, the title of which sounds like an action game, War Room: Pandemic. When the epidemic began in the Chinese province of Hubei, Bannon and his guests speculated that the virus had originated in a secret biological weapons program in the provincial capital of Wuhan there (this conspiracy theory has long been recognized as such and has been refuted). Then he claimed the World Health Organization had been bought by China. In another episode, Bannon, who has been fantasizing about an impending war in the South China Sea for years, said that China&#39;s Communist Party was using the same methods as Hitler and Goebbels. Bannon&#39;s conspiracy theories are grotesque. After his brief stint in the White House and thus close to power, he may have developed into a political outsider again, a clown actually. However, that does not change the fact that figures like him have an audience of millions in the USA. Bannon has been invited to appear on Trump&#39;s favorite broadcaster, Fox News, several times over the past few weeks. And if what New York magazine reported in January is true, White House employees will also hear its podcast. Two years after Trump kicked Bannon, who he later named &quot;Sloppy Steve&quot;, from his team, it almost seems as if the two are slowly getting closer. Donald Trump is not only a sender, he is more than any of his predecessors also a willing recipient of media messages. Anyone who wants to understand what Trump says when and why - this is not a new finding - actually only has to do what Trump himself prefers to do: watch Fox News. The broadest coverage news channel in the USA regularly sets topics that the President takes up shortly afterwards; who in turn regularly fabricates news (including a barely manageable amount of untruths) that Fox News quickly disseminates. Both need each other. Both also need the constant conjuring of enemies in order to keep their own voters or viewers happy. At first glance, it looks as if this symbiotic relationship has continued as usual in the past weeks of the looming corona crisis, which is now apparently developing unchecked in the USA. Trump initially denied - in sync with the on-air statements of most Fox News presenters - the dangers of the corona virus and again accused the political opponent, the Democratic Party, of engaging in a conspiracy against him and the country. After the Mueller investigation, after the impeachment process, Corona should now be the next alleged &quot;hoax&quot;, the next invented story to belittle the president and his supposed achievements. During the month of March, however, Trump&#39;s rhetoric changed, again in line with that of his house broadcaster. The tone became temporarily more cautious, sometimes even presidential in the traditional sense. Until Donald Trump lost his patience a few days ago, apparently everything with this virus is taking too long for him: After Easter, in mid-April, the country will have to be &quot;opened&quot; again, demanded Trump (and was given the stage by Fox News). The president obviously wants to see the exit restrictions that are now in force in large parts of the USA lifted. The economic engine is to be started, with a cold start from zero to one hundred. Trump, who has declared the level of the US stock indices as a measure of his political activity, needs no recession. Quite a few months before the presidential election. Trump is concerned, as the past few weeks have impressively confirmed, primarily about one thing: his re-election in November. For a moment, it looked as if at least his authority to interpret this crisis was slipping away from him - it is obvious that his administration allowed important weeks, almost two months, to pass without developing a federal prevention strategy against the spread of the coronavirus. Now it&#39;s a matter of at least keeping the spin on the crisis, of determining the narrative. Since Trump has positioned himself as a strong leader in the daily Corona press conferences in the White House, his popularity has increased again. Trump&#39;s approval ratings are up to 49 percent, depending on the survey, which is astonishingly high in view of the obviously poor crisis management of his administration. If you look at the past three months since the news of the Corona outbreak in the Chinese province of Wuhan, one thing in the political-media America was different this time. There was a high-profile Fox News presenter who came up much earlier than the others the Corona issue has overthrown. In January, when his colleagues, the president and most of the competing broadcasters were still mainly concerned with the impeachment process, Tucker Carlson raised the alarm about Corona. Carlson broadcasts every evening at 8 p.m. prime time and is one of the most influential mood makers in the country. More notably, Carlson found someone to blame before the massive spread of Covid-19 infections in the United States even began. Carlson blamed &quot;Chinese culture&quot; when Trump thanked Chinese President Xi Jinping via Twitter for handling the virus. In a way, Carlson was &quot;more Trumpet than Trump&quot;, as Vanity Fair put it a few days ago: Carlson saw an opportunity in the virus, albeit a racist one. He thus laid the foundation for what has been seen more and more in the USA since then: the right-wing instrumentalization of the pandemic. That Trump, who was still speaking at the end of February that the number of infected people in the USA would soon be &quot;close to zero&quot;, now sees his country in a &quot;war&quot; against the &quot;Chinese virus&quot; and sees himself as &quot;President in times of war.&quot; &quot;is apparently also due to the fact that Tucker Carlson decided on an extraordinary intervention at the beginning of March. After the moderator had observed Trump&#39;s obvious denial of the looming corona crisis for weeks, he traveled to Florida on March 7 to convince Trump himself of the seriousness of the situation there, in his private club Mar-a-Lago. Carlson later said in an interview that he felt a &quot;moral obligation.&quot; The conversation between the two men is said to have lasted for two hours. Apparently with effect. Much of what Trump has been doing since then follows Carlson&#39;s script. That is: find a simple narrative for a complex situation. More than three million Americans have already lost their jobs due to the de facto freezing of the US economy in the past two weeks, the country is moving towards a recession, and the hospitals in particularly hard-hit cities such as New York City and Seattle have long been overloaded . Trump is now trying to find answers as well as distractions. The direction is becoming increasingly apparent: protect the national borders even harder; emphasize the supposed enemies of the country even more vehemently; invoke even more American patriotism and exceptionalism; Praise the local economy even more furiously - and at the same time warn of its downfall. In short: Trump will probably be even more Trump. And right-wing media will help him with that, especially Fox News. The character of Tucker Carlson isn&#39;t just interesting for understanding Trump&#39;s shift in tactics. Carlson&#39;s daily routine also shows how panic production works. In the monologues that the 50-year-old gives at the beginning of every broadcast, he reliably condemns everything that is somehow left-wing: fundamental approval of immigration, feminism, climate protection, political correctness, globalism, diversity. What sets Carlson apart from the other Fox News anchors is his occasional addressing even against Republicans. Carlson likes to present himself as the indignant loudspeaker of the common worker. But the supposed opposition to the establishment - just like with Trump - ultimately only serves the purpose of playing off the chauvinistic part of white America against minorities and immigrants. Already in the first broadcast in which Carlson reported on the corona virus, on January 23rd, he made it clear which message should be received by his viewers from now on. &quot;I know we have to pretend that all cultures and all behaviors are the same,&quot; said Carlson, but that is not the case. &quot;The abuse of animals, the eating of koalas and snakes and bats and dogs seems to be common in this city, Wuhan,&quot; he continued. What Tucker Carlson hammered into his millions of viewers every day in the following two months can roughly be condensed into this narrative, which he summarized in his broadcast on March 6, the day before his trip to Florida: Communist China only had control over that Took over the global pharmaceutical business, then let loose a virus on the world, and because the liberal media and left activists in the USA are more important than anti-racism and identity politics than safe borders, a number of people should now die. The most existential threat to the USA is not climate change, but the alleged dependence on China. &quot;The people who told us that living in a borderless world had no disadvantages were lying,&quot; said the moderator. &quot;Trump was right about everything: trade, immigration, manufacturing, globalization.&quot; Carlson&#39;s message was unmistakable: The corona crisis was an opportunity to finally implement Trump&#39;s slogan &quot;Make America great again&quot;. The message seems to have arrived. &quot;I think we have learned a lot. We have learned a lot. This crisis has made it clear how important it is to have strong borders and a robust manufacturing sector,&quot; Trump said at a recent press conference. A few days earlier, his staff had sent an email to Trump supporters saying that the US was being &quot;attacked not only by an invisible virus, but also by the Chinese&quot;. The fact that the number of attacks on Americans with Asian origins has increased sharply in recent weeks is probably a direct result of this propaganda. &quot;I&#39;ve never felt like this in my 27 years in this country,&quot; wrote Jiayang Fan, a writer for the New Yorker, on Twitter in mid-March. After more than three years in the White House, there is one thing that you can no longer blame Trump for: that he is difficult to read. Sometimes he follows his impulses, sometimes he follows Fox News. He has no shame and does not care about content-related contradictions. But first and foremost, it is always about asserting one&#39;s power. He is remarkably transparent in that regard. As far as the corona narrative is concerned, the president and the right-wing media makers seem to have clearly come to an agreement. The narrative is called war. It is becoming increasingly clear that this is not just meant rhetorically. On March 26, The Nation magazine announced that the Washington government would send an additional 1,500 soldiers to the Mexican and Canadian borders. While cities like New York have been waiting for support from Washington for weeks, the government is arming the already over-militarized border. &quot;I&#39;m a president at war,&quot; Trump said a few days ago at a press conference. And added: &quot;This is a war. A different kind of war than we ever had.&quot;"}, {"content": "Chinese doctor who first found out about coronavirus was censored. Now, he's dead due to virus.

The picture Beijing is showing of coronavirus infections is not reflecting reality, says the British daily Financial Times based on several interviews with doctors, nurses and hospital staff in Wuhan and Beijing. There are suspicions that not all new cases are being registered, and there is one category that is being systematically left out of the list of official cases: those infected who have no symptoms. In Hubei province, where the city of Wuhan, where the pandemic originated, has not been reported more than one new case a day for more than a week, allowing the government to say that the crisis period is over, and to decree a a sort of return to normality: many people are already starting to work again, albeit under enormous safety measures, mandatory distance at work stations and cafeterias, disinfecting workstations three times a day, for example. And even small steps have already been reversed: there was much talk about the reopening of cinemas (albeit a number of theaters that represented only 5% of the huge Chinese market, in less central provinces, and with old films), this Friday, last ten days, it was announced that the cinemas were all closed again, without any reason being given. Few spectators took advantage of the reopening: many fear that the situation is not yet under control and do not want to put themselves at risk. Beijing meanwhile announced the suspension of entry of foreigners, saying that the new cases of. covid-19 are imported. This Friday, the US and Italy surpassed China in the number of infected, according to data from the Johns Hopkins University. The Financial Times interviewed several doctors and experts who are in China - most spoke anonymously - and who say the situation in Wuhan could be worse than authorities are showing. Two nurses in the city spoke to the British daily, saying there is \u201chidden\u201d numbers, which despite meeting the criteria for confirmed cases, are not being included in the accounts. \u201cThe health staff say the hospital is doing everything to keep track of the count of new cases,\u201d said one of the nurses. \u201cIt is extremely worrying to continue to publicize that there are no new cases. It&#39;s too risky, and it could mean that the sacrifices made in Wuhan and throughout Hubei province were worthless,\u201d she complained. In addition, authorities are counting cases of infected people who have no symptoms, but not including them in confirmed cases, said a health expert who lives in Beijing. The government agency that provides guidelines on what should be considered a confirmed case, says the Financial Times, says that asymptomatic cases should not be included in the total number of confirmed cases. This distinction can be problematic because even if it is not known how or to what percentage, people without symptoms can still transmit the virus to others. And the local newspaper Caixin quoted experts as saying that in Wuhan, \u201ca few, or a few dozen, of asymptomatic carriers were detected every day\u201d, which means that it is not yet possible to \u201cconclude that the transmission has stopped in Wuhan\u201d. The Government maintains that these cases are not a problem, as they are ordered to quarantine during which they are observed if they develop symptoms, and if that happens, they are reclassified as confirmed cases. Generally speaking, not the Chinese case, World Health Organization (WHO) director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Wednesday that isolation measures \u201care the best way to stop transmission so that when they are lifted , there is no resurgence of the coronavirus\u201d.

The Wuhan coronavirus is an example of an unexpected event manual that affects health and the economy. Protein consumption in emerging countries has exploded as their economy and standard of living have grown. The interaction between animal viruses and human diseases as well. A known risk, but unfortunately more and more frequent. It may slow down, but there is also a risk of it becoming a global pandemic. The most similar previous experience was that of the Sars virus in 2002-2003. Since then, prevention mechanisms and response to health alerts have improved across Asia. In countries like South Korea, I have been able to personally appreciate a few days ago that, despite the fact that the incidence is almost zero, the public messages on networks and health measures are considerable. What is now being handled is a significant uncertainty that already has a significant negative economic impact. To date, the consequences of this type of event have not extended beyond a few months. It&#39;s not much of a relief, if anything, because if the coronavirus becomes a pandemic, the effects can be severe at a time of some decline. The resistance of a weak global economy in 2020 goes through the evolution of the Chinese economy and the coronavirus does not help. The first reflections are already appreciated. They have come for the price of crude. The fall in demand - among other issues due to lower industrial activity and land and air traffic in China - reduced the price of a Brent barrel by 6% in the past week alone. Stock market volatility and value indices have not yet reacted to these fears in an appreciable way. But in market analysis forums the risk of contagion is in all mouths. If this and other geopolitical dangers - such as tensions with Iran - are no longer reflected in the markets, it is because they are more dependent on central banks. The lax monetary policy seems to have diminished the ability to emit red flags.

Older malaria drugs are being studied, and in some cases used, to treat or try to prevent infection with the new coronavirus, even though there is no firm evidence to show they are effective. Studies are underway in a number of countries, including China, France and the United States, to see whether the pills - chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine - may have a role to play in the rapidly spreading pandemic.  \n U.S. President Donald Trump has touted the malaria drugs as \"a game changer.\" But the Food and Drug Administration and other health experts said trials must first ensure the medicines are effective and safe for use in this patient population.  \n  \n WHY ARE MALARIA DRUGS UNDER CONSIDERATION?  \n There are currently no vaccines or U.S.-approved treatments for the highly contagious COVID-19 respiratory illness that has killed more than 18,000 worldwide, so even the most severely ill patients largely receive only supportive care such as breathing assistance.  \n On its website, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says some U.S. clinicians have reported anecdotal use of hydroxychloroquine at different doses.  \n Chloroquine is a synthetic form of quinine, which is found on the bark of the cinchona plant. It has been used for hundreds of years in South America to treat fever.  \n Chloroquine was first synthesized in the 1930s. A version called hydroxychloroquine, in use since the 1950s, is considered to be less toxic, according to studies. Both drugs can cause serious side effects, including vision loss, heart problems or even death, if used incorrectly.  \n The drugs are used to combat malaria, which is caused by a parasite spread through mosquito bites, because they interrupt its ability to digest a host's blood cells.  \n Scientists have detailed biochemical proprieties of chloroquine that indicate it could be used against some viral infections. These include direct antiviral effects, such as blocking steps needed by certain viruses to replicate, and its ability to suppress production and release of proteins involved in inflammatory complications of several viral diseases.  \n In addition to malaria, hydroxychloroquine is also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.  \n  \n WHAT DOES THE DATA SAY?  \n Data has begun to emerge from some coronavirus trials, but most information so far is preliminary.  \n A French team last week said initial results from a 24-patient trial of hydroxychloroquine showed that 25% of patients given the drug still carried the coronavirus after six days, compared with 90% of patients given a placebo. But the trial is small and results on patient outcomes are still awaited.  \n Chinese researchers last month reported trial results showing that chloroquine treatment of COVID-19 patients had clinical and virologic benefit versus a comparison group. It has been added as a recommended treatment for the illness in China, where the virus first emerged in December.  \n This week, the Journal of Zhejiang University reported disappointing results from a 30-patient Shanghai study of hydroxychloroquine. It showed the drug worked no better than standard care for patients with COVID-19.  \n The University of Minnesota has launched a 1,500-person trial to see whether hydroxychloroquine can prevent or reduce the severity of COVID-19 in people exposed to the virus - including healthcare workers and family members of infected people.  \n Other trials of the malaria drugs are ongoing or set to start in the United Kingdom, Norway and Thailand.  \n New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, whose state is the epicentre of the U.S. outbreak with more than 25,000 cases, on Sunday said it had acquired hundreds of thousands of doses of the malaria drugs to use in a clinical trial.  \n  \n IS THERE ENOUGH TO GO AROUND?  \n In the United States, prescriptions for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have already spiked and are in short supply, according to pharmacists.  \n Several makers of the generic medicines said they are increasing production of chloroquine pills. Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd, Mylan NV and Bayer AG have donated large quantities of the drugs to health authorities.  \n  \n PRESCRIPTION ONLY!  \n Health officials caution that no one should be taking these drugs to treat or prevent coronavirus infection without medical supervision and a prescription.  \n In Arizona, a man died and his wife was hospitalized after taking a nonmedical form of chloroquine used to fight parasites in aquariums.  \n \"Given the uncertainty around COVID-19, we understand that people are trying to find new ways to prevent or treat this virus, but self-medicating is not the way to do so,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Brooks, medical director of the poison and drug information centre at Arizona-based Banner Health.

Chinese snake, Naja atra Martin Harvey/Getty Images A study published in the Journal of Medical Virology points to two species of Chinese snake - Bungarus multicinctus and Naja atra (known as the Chinese snake) - sold in the Wuhan market as the most likely transmitting agent of the coronavirus - known as 2019-nCoV - from animals to humans. The conclusion, not yet closed and controversial, was advanced by researchers from the universities of Beijing and Wuhan Bioengineering, the city where the first infected patients emerged, some of whom were workers at the place that sells meat from exotic animals, such as bats, frogs, hedgehogs, snakes and snakes. The outbreak that has already led the Chinese authorities to extend the quarantine to 20 cities and 33 million people is said to originate from a virus of the same family as the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) epidemics. initially in bats and that it will have mutated into snakes and snakes. The study&#39;s conclusion, still without scientific validation, was advanced after genetic sequence analyzes were carried out on more than 200 coronarovirus genomes in possible host animals, later compared with samples from infected people. The analyzes proved that the genetic sequence of the 2019-nCoV virus had the bat as its original transmitting agent, before &#39;jumping&#39; to snakes and from these to humans. It remains a mystery to researchers how the coronavirus was transmitted from cold-blooded hosts to humans, a virus that causes respiratory complications and severe pneumonia that can lead to death. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDS), cases of coronaviruses susceptible to being transmitted from animals to humans are rare, as is now the case with 2019-n-CoV. In the study published this Thursday, researchers found that this strain of virus is a mixture or combination of two coronaviruses - one that infects bats, another of unknown origin so far, but which after the genes of several animal species analyzed, everything points to for snakes as the modifying agent. Investigators not involved in the current study, however, question the conclusions of Chinese university professors, assuring Paulo Eduardo Paix\u00e3o, a virologist at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, in Brazil, that &quot;there is no scientific evidence&quot; that the snake could be a host of the virus in cause.

Seven cases of Covid-19 in Spain and 11 dead in Italy. It&#39;s a movie-worthy setting. Quarantined cities, canceled transport, suspended flights, low purses, lack of food in supermarkets, thousands of citizens isolated on ships, hotels or in their homes. After China, the new coronavirus appears to be testing health devices and the consequent response of European countries (but not only) to an epidemic. In just over three days, Italy witnessed an exponential increase in positive cases: if by Friday there were only three people infected with the virus, and all of them identified as new arrivals from the Chinese city of Wuhan \u2013 where the outbreak began at the end of last year \u2013 three more people died this Tuesday, bringing the total balance to 11.

For now, the pattern of deaths recorded in Italy is similar to that seen in China. It is older people and those with associated illnesses, such as cancer, diabetes, respiratory diseases and others that depress the immune system, who are being most affected. However, very nearby, Austria, Croatia and Switzerland confirmed cases of infection. Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovi\u0107 confirmed the first case of infection in the Balkan country. \u201cThe patient is at an infectious disease clinic in Zagreb. He is a younger person and has mild symptoms. He is in isolation and his condition is positive at the moment\u201d, explained the official quoted by The Guardian. Minutes earlier, Austria had confirmed the first two cases detected. A spokeswoman for the health authority of the province of Tyrol \u2014 which borders the northern region of Italy \u2014 confirmed that two Italians tested positive for the control of the coronavirus. Local media say the governor of this Austrian province, Guenther Platter, said the two men had recently traveled to the Lombardy region, one of the worst affected in the neighboring country, pointing to that displacement as the likely cause of infection. Spain has already registered the seventh case \u2014 the regional government of Catalonia confirmed today the first case in the autonomous community, as well as Valencia and Madrid. The H10 Costa Adeje Palace hotel, in the southern part of the island of Tenerife, in the Canary Islands, was placed in quarantine today by the Spanish authorities. About a thousand tourists in its interior are in isolation and will undergo medical examinations.

After three meetings, the World Health Organization (WHO) decided that the coronavirus outbreak should be classified as a public health emergency of international concern. What might this change in relation to the various containment measures applied around the world? Little or almost nothing. Obviously, the health authorities were not waiting for the WHO decision to proceed with all the control measures, under the precautionary principle. The fact that the new coronavirus has already entered 18 countries after the outbreak was identified in December in the city of Wuhan, China, and the confirmation of the disease&#39;s human-to-human transmission outside Chinese territory were two factors that led the WHO to convene the experts once again. The emergency committee met for the third time in a week to discuss the need to declare a global public health emergency. Currently, there are 98 cases in 18 countries outside China, including 8 cases of person-to-person transmission in four countries: Germany, Japan, Vietnam and the USA. While the meeting was still underway, the WHO daily \u201cbulletin\u201d on coronavirus this Thursday updated the numbers rising from 15 to 18 affected countries compared to the day before. It was also stressed that the new cases detected in Finland, the Philippines and India have some connection with trips to the city of Wuhan. In the bulletin, the WHO referred 7818 confirmed cases and 170 deaths. However, the numbers updated earlier in the evening pointed to 8235 infected patients, with 171 dead, according to a team from Johns Hopkins University (in the US) that is monitoring the situation. &quot;We have to remember that it&#39;s not just numbers, it&#39;s people,&quot; said the WHO director-general. Invoking a World Wide Public Health Emergency (PHEIC) is basically the single most important signal WHO can give the world. The rules of this process say that to declare a PHEIC, the situation under analysis must meet three criteria: it must be an extraordinary event, with a risk that represents a high danger to the public health of other countries and that requires a coordinated international response. It is the sixth time that WHO has used this global alert tool. &quot;Let&#39;s be clear, this declaration is not a vote of lack of confidence in China,&quot; Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of WHO, stressed to journalists. &quot;Our biggest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health care systems,&quot; he added. The WHO panel, chaired by Didier Houssin, France, is composed of 16 independent experts. \u201cThe main reason for this statement is not what is happening in China, but what is happening in other countries,\u201d he underlined. With this new designation to classify the epidemic of the new coronavirus that was detected in December in China, WHO can make recommendations to all countries to control the outbreak. Something he started doing a long time ago. It can also issue recommendations on travel and surveillance of passengers at international airports and other ports of arrival. Something that will not be necessary either, as many countries have already moved towards containment measures of this type. &quot;WHO does not recommend the restriction of travel, trade and movement [of people] and is even opposed to all travel restrictions,&quot; said the director general of WHO at the press conference that took place this Thursday at the end of the day, at the organization&#39;s headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. The WHO decision could further lead to increased funding and resources to contain the outbreak. This is, at first glance, the main difference that we can see in relation to the last days. But it is not easy to imagine how countries can further strengthen the efforts they have shown in surveillance, detection and monitoring of new cases. This new coronavirus manifests itself with variable severity, from mild symptoms similar to a flu or cold to more severe symptoms such as pneumonia (among the 7818 infected, 1370 are considered to be serious). The incubation period varies between two and 12 days The money could be used to impose more measures on the ground, but also to invest in the scientific \u201cmachine\u201d that has been working in this field from a very early age. The first genome of the virus was shared by the China team with the international community earlier this month. This Thursday, once again, the director general of WHO commended China for its collaboration throughout the process. &quot;We would have seen many more cases outside of China - and probably deaths - if it weren&#39;t for the government&#39;s efforts and the progress they&#39;ve made to protect the people of China and around the world.&quot; \u201cThe only way to defeat this outbreak is for all countries to work together in a spirit of solidarity and cooperation\u201d, concluded Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, still leaving the warning in an appealing tone: \u201cThis is the moment of facts, not fear. This is the time for science, not rumors. This is the time for solidarity, not stigma.\u201d It will be with cooperation between all countries that it will be possible to reduce the number of infected people. And this is the key to curbing the epidemic, says to P\u00daBLICO Nuno Faria, associate professor in genomic epidemiology at the University of Oxford, United Kingdom. Thus, he continues, &quot;there are two ways to be able to reduce the number of people infected&quot;. \u201cOne is through vaccines and treatment, which unfortunately are not yet available for the new virus. Although teams already exist in mainland China, the United States and Hong Kong, working on a vaccine will take some time before we have an effective vaccine. The other involves controlling the epidemic through a series of interventions aimed at reducing contact between infected people and people still susceptible to the new virus.\u201d The Alliance for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced shortly after that three different research teams are trying to develop vaccines against the new coronavirus. The aim is for clinical trials to start in June for at least one of the vaccines. The research teams will take different approaches: one will be led by the pharmaceutical company Moderna in conjunction with the US National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases; another by the company Inovio; and the third by a team from the University of Queensland, Australia. &quot;There are no guarantees of success, but we hope this work will be a significant and important step in the development of a vaccine for this disease,&quot; said Richard Hatchett, executive director of CEPI.

Is it a reflection of increased surveillance. \u201cIn just one week at least seven universities and public health institutions designed and shared with the community new diagnostic methods for the new virus. With the increase in cases to be tested, an increase in the number of confirmed cases is also expected\u201d, says Nuno Faria. The impact of this new virus will depend on several factors that are not yet complete or completely clear, including the mortality rate and its transmissibility, that is, the ease with which it spreads in the population. Current estimates place the 2019-nCoV mortality rate below 3%. \u201cTo put it in context, the other coronaviruses that caused recent outbreaks such as SARS [in 2003] and MERS [in 2012] have a much higher mortality rate of around 10% and 37%, respectively. However, one of the concerns regarding the new 2019-nCoV coronavirus is that it is more easily transmitted between humans compared to its &#39;cousins&#39; SARS and MERS\u201d, stresses the Portuguese epidemiologist who collaborates with the WHO. The last time WHO declared a global public health emergency was in 2019 for the Ebola virus outbreak, which is still ongoing in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has killed more than 2000 people. WHO also considered the following epidemics as international public health emergencies: in 2016, the Zika virus; in 2014, the previous Ebola outbreak in West Africa that killed more than 11,000 people between 2014 and 2016; in 2014, polio; in 2009, the swine flu (the H1N1 virus)."}, {"content": "Exclusive: Citadel turns 2020 profit after spotting virus risk early. BOSTON (Reuters) - Citadel, the Chicago-based hedge fund giant led by billionaire Ken Griffin, has so far weathered the coronavirus market storm well, turning a slight profit in its flagship Wellington hedge fund for the year through Monday, according to a person familiar with the situation.\nThe fund, which practices a so-called multi-strategy array of bets on stocks, bonds, commodities and other securities using teams of traders, was as of Friday down 5.25% for March, the person said, who requested anonymity because the information is private. The exact year-to-date gain, which is net of fees, was not finalized.\nBy comparison, Goldman Sachs\u2019 prime services division estimated that the average equity-focused hedge fund is down 15.5% for the month through Thursday, with average year-to-date losses at nearly 16%.\nCitadel\u2019s multi-strategy competitors are still down for the year amid the coronavirus-led market rout.

The Wall Street Journal previously reported that Citadel\u2019s fixed-income portfolio recently lost hundreds of millions of dollars, in part from so-called basis trades on pricing gaps between U.S. Treasuries and futures, although those unrealized losses were recovered within days. The Citadel Global Fixed Income Fund is now positive for the year through Monday, the person with knowledge of Citadel said.\nCitadel showed it was thinking about coronavirus and its market impact relatively early.\nOn Feb. 6, Griffin called the coronavirus \u201cprobably the most concrete short-run risk we see in the financial markets globally\u201d during an appearance at The Economic Club of New York.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a Chinese health crisis. It is a global health crisis,\u201d he said.\nCitadel had three days earlier announced that its executives had mobilized $7.5 million to support relief efforts in the United States and China, including more than $1 million in medical supplies to a hospital in hard-hit Wuhan.\nThe firm recently set up the Citadel Relative Value Fixed Income Fund, according to a March 13 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a bid to take advantage of new market volatility.\nCitadel has placed an emphasis on risk management since the last financial crisis, when its main funds lost 55% over 2008 and were forced to temporarily limit client withdrawals.\nIts website touts \u201ca quarter of a century establishing risk management as a core discipline\u201d and a global risk management center in Chicago, anchored by a 27 foot by 8 foot data visualization touchscreen.\nThe firm still uses significant leverage, or borrowed money, to amplify its potential profits. A Jan. 17 SEC filing notes regulatory assets under management of about $194 billion as of Dec. 31, 2018, implying leverage of approximately six and a half times Citadel\u2019s $30 billion in invested assets as of February, according to its website.\n2020 marks 30 years since Citadel was founded by Griffin, who famously started the firm after trading from his Harvard College dorm room.

Zhou Xianwang, mayor of Wuhan City Council, the Chinese city where the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was initially detected, admitted to hiding information about the outbreak. The time it took the local government to transmit the data it already had was enough for at least five million people to leave the city, before isolation was decreed, a fact that may have contributed to the virus spreading throughout the country. Xianwang also confessed that transmission was taking place between people and not through bacteria or other means. With the revelation made this Monday to Chinese state television, the mayor concluded that the only way out was to make the position available.

The governor of Hubei Province (where Wuhan City is located), Wang Xiaodong, attended the conference without wearing a mask, violating rules that make wearing masks mandatory in public spaces. Mayor Zhou Xianwang, at his side, remembered the mask, but wore it backwards, which provoked jokes on the Weibo social network, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter. The Mayor of Wuhan had already been heavily criticized for authorizing, on January 18 and 19, a giant banquet to which 40,000 families were invited to celebrate the Chinese New Year.

Governments must respond to the Covid-19 pandemic by giving priority to health, but not ignoring the protection of human rights, defended this Thursday the organization Human Rights Watch (HRW), in a report. &quot;When governments are beginning to scale up their responses to public health, the threat posed by Covid-19 is reason to reaffirm, not abandon, the rights of all,&quot; recalls HRW in the report &quot;Human rights dimensions of response to Covid-19&quot;, released this Thursday. &quot;This means prioritizing science over policy, caring for those most at risk, avoiding censorship, limiting roadblocks and building trust in people, which is essential for an effective response,&quot; said Kenneth Roth, CEO of HRW . The report analyzes the obligations of governments at a time when the human rights concerns posed by the outbreak of the new coronavirus must not be overlooked. The organization proposes recommendations for governments to address the outbreak while respecting fundamental human rights, including the rights to health, freedom of expression, non-discrimination and freedom of movement. For HRW, governments should avoid broad and excessive restrictions on freedom of movement, rely on voluntary social distancing and move towards mandatory restrictions only when scientifically justified and when the system of support for affected people is assured. When quarantines or blockades are imposed, HRW recalls that governments are obliged to guarantee access to food, water, medical care and support from caregivers, recalls the organization, which draws attention to the delicate situations involving detention centers of migrants, nursing homes, prisons and spaces with people with disabilities. The organization&#39;s concerns arise when the Covid-19 outbreak is revealing deficiencies in public health and social protection systems, making it difficult to protect people at risk and the need to reduce disease transmission. Therefore, HRW advises governments to &quot;scale up information campaigns to ensure that people are aware of the risk of Covid-19 and strategies to avoid the infection.&quot; The organization also says that governments must ensure that everyone has access to essential health care, including migrants, asylum seekers and refugees, as well as ensure the right to education, even if schools are temporarily closed. HRW recalls that since a new coronavirus was identified in Wuhan, China, in December, it has reported rights abuses related to the Chinese Government&#39;s authoritarian response, as well as identified risks to prisoners and detainees in the United States, Syria and Iran &quot;The best way to fight Covid-19 is to be scrupulously honest with the public, restrict movement only to the extent necessary to limit the risk of contagion and take care of the most vulnerable,&quot; said Kenneth Roth."}, {"content": "On the menu at Wuhan virus market: Rats and live wolf pups. SHANGHAI:\u00a0The food market where China's deadly virus surfaced was a smorgasbord of exotic wildlife ranging from wolf pups to species linked to previous pandemics such as civets, according to vendor information and a Chinese media report. \n The Huanan Seafood Market in the central city of Wuhan came under greater scrutiny on Wednesday (Jan 22) as Chinese officials said that the virus which has so far killed 17 people\u00a0and infected hundreds may have originated in a wild animal sold at the food emporium. \n Past deadly epidemics have been blamed on wild animals - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was linked to Chinese consumption of civet meat -\u00a0setting Chinese authorities up for potential embarrassment if lax supervision of wildlife trafficking is found at fault in the latest outbreak. \n A price list circulating on China's Internet for a business at the Wuhan market lists a menagerie of animals or animal-based products including live foxes, crocodiles, wolf puppies, giant salamanders, snakes, rats, peacocks, porcupines, camel meat and other game - 112 items in all. \n \"Freshly slaughtered, frozen and delivered to your door,\" said the price list for the vendor, \"Wild Game Animal Husbandry for the Masses\". \n Gao Fu, director of the Chinese centre for disease control and prevention, said in Beijing on Wednesday that authorities believe the virus likely came from \"wild animals at the seafood market\" though the exact source remains undetermined. \n China bans the trafficking of a number of wild species or requires special licenses, but regulations are loose for some species if they are commercially farmed. \n AFP was unable to directly confirm the authenticity of the price list. Phone calls to the vendor went unanswered, and attempts to connect to its social media accounts were rejected. \n The Beijing News published a photo on Tuesday showing the same vendor's now-shuttered store front, as authorities in white hazmat suits milled about. \n  \n The paper also quoted other merchants as saying trade in wildlife took place up until the market was shuttered for disinfection shortly after the outbreak. \n A number of the early sufferers of the virus, now known as the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), were employees of the market. \n VIRUS 'SPILLOVER' \n Many exotic species are still widely consumed in China or other Asian countries where they are considered a delicacy - like the civet or some rats or bats -\u00a0or for purported health benefits. \n But this brings growing human health risks, said Christian Walzer, executive director of the US-based Wildlife Conservation Society's Health Program. \n Walzer said 70 per cent of all new infectious diseases come from wildlife, with habitat encroachment increasing the chances of pathogens spreading. \n  \n \"Wildlife markets offer a unique opportunity for viruses to spill over from wildlife hosts,\" he said. \n \"It is essential to invest resources not only into discovering new viruses, but more importantly, in determining the epidemiological drivers of ... (the) spillover, amplification, and spread of infectious diseases.\" \n Bats are thought to have spawned SARS, which in 2002-03 killed hundreds of people in Asia, mostly China. \n SARS was also found in civets in wildlife markets in China, with many scientists believing the bat virus infected the cat-like creatures and then humans who ate them. \n Following SARS, China cracked down on consumption of civets and some other species, but conservationists say the trade continues. \n China has so far won praise for its openness and handling of the current outbreak in stark contrast to SARS, when it was accused of stifling information and failing to cooperate with the rest of the world. \n Follow us on Telegram for the latest updates: https://cna.asia/telegram"}, {"content": "coronavirus cases in china's hubei fall for second day, apple and markets feel impact.

Vinaya Chandran knew exactly what he wanted to do even before he was released from the army quarantine camp in Manesar, Har\u00adyana eat a home-cooked meal with his family in his hometown Alappuzha in Kerala. The camp has looked after us well. We have all become close friends. But the food is not what I am used to, says the 31-year-old medical student from Wuhan University, China. He and the 647 other Indians evacuated from Wuhan on January 30 and February 1 in two batches were released on February 19 after they tested negative for the Novel Coronavirus (nCoV). However, to avoid taking chances, each person has been home quarantined for an additional 14 days, with their respective district hospitals monitoring the situation. With over 80,239 cases worldwide and 2,700 deaths (as of February 26), the human cost of nCoV has been making headlines since December 2019, and no country wants to take the threat lightly. The virus was first identified as nCoV, then changed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and finally named Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization.\nThe devastating effects of a virus pandemic are being felt all the more by the global community this time around, because of the visual outpouring from Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak. This is not a tragedy happening in a forgotten corner of the planet. It is unfolding in the heart of the world\u2019s largest economy. Footage of helpless residents not being able to come close to their own family and desperate foreigners begging to return to their home countries have been doing the rounds for over two months. In India, the impact of nCoV has been considerably small, with just three confirmed outbreaks in Kerala. All of whom have now recovered and are under medical supervision. The state has experienced virus outbreaks before and its health department began precautionary measures for nCoV even before they were implemented at a national level.\nIndia might have escaped nCoV, but given the worrying trend of virus outbreaks every few years, we need to ask do we have a system in place to handle a Wuhan-sized pandemic?\nThe burden of control and eradication of disease when it reaches alarming proportions does not fall entirely on a country\u2019s health system. It is supported by various other agencies. While in India, the ministry of health and family welfare is the nodal ministry handling biological and health emergencies, such crises also come under the purview of disaster management agencies, the ministry of home affairs and the National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC). India has pioneered the Delhi Declaration on Emergency Preparedness\u2019 which identifies risks, implements disaster risk reduction measures and prepares and operationalises readiness for a broad range of disasters, including diseases and outbreaks, says Professor S.S. Vasan, an Indian-origin scientist who is leading the vaccine development against the nCoV at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Australia.\nHowever, for a long time, disaster management in India followed no defined path and remained an informal state subject, since after the Bengal famine of 1943 it was assumed that the only disasters India could face would be related to food shortages. There was no mention of disaster management in the Constitution as a state or a central subject. Despite such calamities as the 1950 Assam earthquake or the Bhopal gas disaster of 1984, it was only after the 2001 Bhuj earthquake and the setting up of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) in 2005 that disaster management protocols and policies were evolved. An outbreak of nCoV, a biological disaster, would be part of Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) defence. As such the states or the health ministry can request additional assistance from the NDMA, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) as well as the armed forces.\nA NATION ALERTED\nThe standard procedure for a health emergency would start at the point of outbreak, then be tackled from a state perspective and, finally, be seen through a national lens. However, when the threat is coming from an international source, like nCoV, the system is reversed. The first level of action is national to prevent the virus from reaching Indian soil.\nIndia\u2019s initial response to nCoV was slow compared to other countries. The outbreak in Wuhan began to show signs of a serious epidemic in early January, and the European countries, Singapore, Japan and the US began to trace and isolate their China returnees almost immediately. In India, the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) only monitors public health. We are yet to establish an organisation meant to watch health emergencies around the world, a practice followed by many countries in the West. As a result, India began rolling out its emergency health machinery to tackle nCoV only by the end of January.\nA group of ministers (GoM) was constituted on the directions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on January 30 and held its first meeting on February 3 for the management of nCoV. Members included the Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, minister of civil aviation Hardeep S. Puri, external affairs minister S. Jaishankar, minister of state for home G. Kishan Reddy, minister of state for health and family welfare Ashwini Kumar Choubey, and minister of state for shipping Mansukh Lal Mandaviya.\nFollowing the first meeting, the health ministry addressed four key issues a risk advisory, travel screening, lab testing and quarantine facilities. Screening posts were set up at 21 international airports and 12 major ports. Staff at these entry points were trained to screen for possible infections after the Ebola outbreak in 2014, when the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) outlined the roles of health officers at airports to handle future infections. Passengers from suspected routes are given a leaflet to check if they are displaying certain symptoms and then screened on deboarding. Immigration officers and security personnel have been sensitised on how to handle passengers and equipped with personal protection equipment. Around 4,214 flights and 448,449 passengers have been screened till date.\nThe second step was to isolate China returnees and suspected cases. A total of 23,259 people have been brought under community surveillance. Every state is equipped with a rapid response team and government hospitals in each district are marked as isolation wards. The health teams can also ask for private hospitals to be on standby in Delhi, for instance, both RML Hospital and Safdarjung Hospital have 25-bed isolation wards for nCoV cases. In case of a pandemic, hospitals will suspend regular work, which takes up about 80 per cent of the beds, to accommodate more patients, says Dr Jagdish Prasad, former director general of health services. Zika and Ebola, he says, were major turning points for health emergency services in India. We started to rethink our requirements for disease control at a national level, adds Prasad, who is also the founder principal of Safdarjung Hospital and presently a principal consultant with the DGHS.\nThe National Institute for Virology (NIV) Pune, one of the 15 global laboratories identified by the WHO to provide reference testing for the nCoV, was also put on alert. Though India has a long way to go for native virological studies and vaccine development teams, we are not too far behind either in terms of laboratory training and testing. The US\u2019s Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, for example, has been training lab staff in India to handle, test and identify viruses. The NCDC, too, is equipped to support labs in testing. There are 105 viral research and diagnostic labs across India to support NIV if needed. For nCoV, 2,707 samples have been sent so far to NIV for a full report; only three from Kerala have tested positive.\nThe health ministry has issued advisories for the public, health workers and airport and lab staff, including travel and discharge advisories, guidelines for managing infected persons, isolating patients, and packaging and transporting test samples.\nDISASTER MANAGEMENT AGENCIES ON STAND BY\nIn the event that a health outbreak is identified as a national threat, each state has a disease surveillance programme which sends a daily report to the NCMC and the NDMA. The latter then view the crisis from a national and inter-state perspective and work with state teams to recommend measures, check resources and connect states to border and central agencies, if needed. The first step was to have screenings at all porous and non-porous borders, and identify isolation wards. In Kerala, for example, there were two hospitals in each district where isolation wards for nCoV cases were set up, says Saurabh Dalal, consultant for medical preparedness and biological disasters, NDMA, who was in Kerala to monitor nCoV management. Going forward, we plan to have a pandemic preparedness plan for each district. Only when all community resources have been exhausted will assistance from NDRF be requested. As it was during the Nipah outbreak of 2018, the NDRF is on stand-by were nCoV to turn into a serious health pandemic. The NDRF functions as a force of assistance to states under the assumption that there is a requisition made, says S.N. Pradhan, director general of NDRF. We have 12 battalions and 18 specialised teams, two of which are specifically trained to handle biological emergencies. Once nCoV was identified as a possible threat, we distributed about 100 suits to our battalions and sent our doctors to sensitise the immigration bureau that would be dealing directly with passengers from high-risk routes. In China, a 1,000-bed hospital was set up within 10 days and Wuhan was cordoned off. In India, the army can rapidly deploy such resources and shut down a state if needed. But it can be decided only at the cabinet level, along with the ministry of home affairs, says Pradhan.\nSTATE ACTION PLAN\nStates can use disaster response funds from the NDMA to detect and handle a crisis. Each state is also equipped with district emergency centres, and district magistrates become incident commanders. A private limited company under the state health department and the National Health Mission maintains stockpiles of personal protection equipment, masks and biological suits.\nKerala became the first state to declare a state emergency for a public health disaster. It was lifted within the first week of February. Widely praised for its handling of the nCoV crisis, not only did Kerala ensure mass isolation for suspected cases, it also made sure that 4 million children in schools were educated about the virus. Special advisories were issued for the blind, elderly, illiterate, differently-abled and health workers (demographic segments often overlooked during disaster communication). However, it is important to note state discrepancies in cases of health crises. Kerala enjoys a better quality of public healthcare and better health indicators than several northern states. Not every state has the capacity to handle a virus outbreak in the same manner. The NDMA has plans to document Kerala\u2019s management of nCoV as a future example to other states.\nOverall, our health disaster management largely rests on short-term steps for control and eradication. The long-term repercussions still need to be considered. There are other aspects of a pandemic that could have crippling effects on morale and economy. Food shortages, financial loss, miscommunication and human rights abuse are aspects of disaster management that have never been handled before. The 2003 SARS outbreak, for instance, is estimated to have resulted in global economic losses to the tune of $30-100 billion, according to the Asian Development Bank; nCoV is predicted to have a similar impact.\nAnother loophole in the system is the presence of multiple agencies the health and home ministries, NCMC, NDMA, NDRF, NCDC and state health departments each with a stake in biological disaster management. Having too many bureaucratic players inevitably leads to longer decision time, confusion and overlap in responsibilities. While we have the guidelines on paper, real life implementation is an altogether different story."}, {"content": "a black swan arrives: investors keep watch as covid-19 outbreak changes market sentiments. The coronavirus outbreak has been very much in the news and, apart from its impact on public health and the economy, is\u00a0also affecting\u00a0investments. \n Investors should position their portfolio carefully and watch markets closely during this period. \n IMPACT ON STOCK MARKETS \n Concerns about the Covid-19 coronavirus\u00a0in various countries continue to roil the markets with a heavy dose of volatility, financial advisory firm ETF Database observed. \n British newspaper The Guardian reported that financial markets remain confident the crisis will soon blow over, as share prices have been rebounding because investors think the coronavirus can be contained. \n Yet, it also noted that Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economic adviser to insurance company Allianz, thinks that the economic damage could be a black swan event equivalent to the collapse of the US sub-prime mortgage market. \n Black swan events is a term popularised by writer Nassim Taleb and based on a\u00a0saying that black swans did not exist (until they were discovered in the wild). \n They are events that come as a complete surprise, have profound consequences and are rationalised by people who never saw the crisis coming and who then say after the fact that it was glaringly obvious that there was trouble ahead.\u00a0 \n The epidemic in China caused by coronavirus Covid-19 and the infections spreading in other\u00a0countries have already become a black swan event for the Asia-Pacific tourism industry, business information company IHS Markit says. It could hit other sectors as well. \n MARKET FORECASTS \n While investors understandably want to know what to do at this time of uncertainty. financial advisory firm Evergreen Gavekal\u2019s adviser Arthur Kroebel says that it is a \u201cfool\u2019s errand\u201d to come up with highly specific forecasts for the ultimate impact on Chinese, regional or global gross domestic product (GDP) given the uncertainties involved. \n If it does turn into a global pandemic, he said, global supply chains would face more disruption, commodity prices would fall more severely, and central banks would face pressure to offset the impact.\u00a0 \n Already, though, financial services firm ING expects that potential spreading of the virus across the globe could last until March or April and mark a new downside risk to the global economy in the first half of 2020. \n Investment bank JP Morgan said that the coronavirus remains in its early stages and \u201cis likely to worsen before getting better\u201d. \n Here in Singapore, DBS bank said that the outbreak has thrown the Singapore economy a curveball. \n Supply chain disruptions such as extended factory closures within China will have a significant impact on Singapore\u2019s manufacturing sector, for example, and consumer spending is expected to be dampened as residents take more precautionary actions in their daily lives. \n As a result, \u201cwe are downgrading our 2020 real GDP forecast to 0.9% (from 1.4%) in response to the potential impact. The concern is that the impact could be deeper than Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome).\u201d \n Over in Hong Kong, The Guardian said that the economy risks being plunged deeper into recession as the outbreak wreaks havoc, with consumers panic-buying staple goods and airlines stopping flights.\u00a0  POSITION YOUR PORTFOLIO PROTECTIVELY \n Amid all these uncertainties, a key question for investors is how to position their investment portfolio well and prepare effectively for whatever the next several months may bring. \n \u201cWhen you don\u2019t know,\u201d Mr Ray Dalio, founder of hedge-fund giant Bridgewater Associates told MarketWatch, \u201cthe best investment strategy is to be smartly diversified across geographic locations, asset classes, and currencies.\u201d \n So far, he said, \u201cfears of the spreading coronavirus have triggered a \u2018flight-to-quality\u2019 that continues to pressure stocks while giving a lift to hedges such as gold, bonds and the (US) dollar.\u201d \n British financial research firm Trustnet similarly said that some investors have started taking more defensive positions, with government bonds and gold being preferred options. \n For stocks, it could be advantageous to avoid vulnerable companies in the tourism sector such as airlines and cruise lines or hotels and to buy companies such as e-commerce or food delivery firms that will benefit even if consumers stay at home. \n Investors can also benefit by taking advantage of shifts in the market. \n While JPMorgan Chase analysts noted that previous global health scares such as Sars and Zika did not unsettle equities for an extended period, the MSCI Hong Kong index lost about 9 per cent during the Sars epidemic and then jumped17 per cent in the three months after the disease faded from view. \n Investment brokerage Schwab similarly said that although there is always a chance that this outbreak could have greater consequences, the global economy and markets have been relatively immune to the effects of past viral epidemics. \u201cA short-term dip in stocks tended to be followed by the continuation of the upward trend,\u201d it said. \n While there is uncertainty about the impact on investments and a panicked rush to buy less risky assets is not appropriate, investors would be well-advised to examine their portfolio and ensure that it is sufficiently diversified. \n Given the uncertainties, it could also be advisable to take a more defensive posture than usual over the next several months and increase the allocation to investments in bonds while reducing the allocation to stocks and potentially shifting the types of stocks in the portfolio. \n Even though the timing of an upturn is uncertain, watching trends and taking advantage of dips to buy if markets rebound could also be beneficial."}, {"content": "Barcelona donates 30,000 masks to health authorities in Catalonia.

SINGAPORE - Singapore banks' loan growth will slow to 1.5 per cent in 2020, down from 3.1 per cent last year, given the stiff economic headwinds facing Singapore from the coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak, Fitch Solutions Macro Research forecast in a report released on Friday (Feb 14). \n The likelihood of a more pronounced slowdown is likely to weigh on credit demand, with businesses across a broad range of sectors including retail, tourism and the export-oriented manufacturing sector, likely to encounter tougher conditions as a result of the cornavirus epidemic around the world, said the research firm. It nopted that Singapore banks have already been contending with a contraction in consumer loan growth. \n Furthermore, likely monetary easing from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) would prevent interest rates from falling too far to offset lower credit demand, it said. \n Fitch Solutions said that while interest rates would normally fall in order to adjust to lower credit demand, Singapore is likely to undergo monetary easing in 2020 in a bid to support the economy, especially the exporting sectors, limiting the extent to which this is possible. \n Unlike other countries which use interest rates as the policy lever, Singapore uses the exchange rate instead. Easing monetary policy under such a system tends instead to have an upward effect on interest rates as they would adjust to maintain the attractiveness of assets denominated in the Singapore dollar, all other things equal. Therefore, as the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (Sibor) rises in tandem with a weaker Singapore dollar, banks will find it hard to lower their rates significantly to bolster credit demand, further weighing on loan growth. Sibor is a key benchmark rate to price most home loans here. \n Its report comes a day after DBS flagged\u00a0the risks to its earnings from the virus outbreak as it announced quarterly and full-year results.. CEO Piyush Gupta said that if\u00a0the outbreak\u00a0is controlled by the summer,\u00a0 the hit to\u00a0revenue could be\u00a01 to 2 per cent.\u00a0OCBC and United Overseas Bank are set to announce their results on Feb 21. \n Fitch Solutions observed that loan growth last year was due to a recovery in lending to businesses that began in April 2019, in line with Singapore's stronger economic performance towards the latter half of 2019. But consumer loans (around 40 per cent of total loans) remained in contraction last year, mostly a reflection of the cooling property market and by extension, slower mortgage growth. \n However, the recovery in business loans (around 60 per cent of all loans) is unlikely to be sustainable in 2020 given that Singapore's open economy is heavily exposed to the likely deeper slowdown in the Chinese economy from the Covid-19 outbreak, said Fitch Solutions. It has revised down China's 2020 real GDP growth to 5.6 per cent from 5.9 per cent. \n \"As a result, our current 2020 real GDP growth forecast of 1.7 per cent for Singapore is exposed to heavy downside risks, and we will revisiting this figure over the coming weeks,\" said the firm. \n The report also noted that Singapore's export-oriented manufacturing sector is closely tied to those of China's economy and that the outbreak will hit a sector already weakened by the ongoing US-China trade war and the slowdown in China. Singapore's non-oil domestic exports posted 12 straight months of contraction at an average pace of 10.8 per cent year on year between December 2018 and November 2019, it calculated. \n It also said the tourism and related hospitality and retail sectors in Singapore will take a hit, not just from the plunge in Chinese visitors, who make up 18.5 per cent of arrivals here, but also as the climbing infection toll in Singapore and the Orange outbreak response level likely deters visitors from other countries as well. \n Fitch Solutions is part of the Fitch Group, which also comprises credit rating agency Fitch Ratings."}, {"content": "Two Malaysian evacuees from Wuhan positive for coronavirus - Health Minister.

SINGAPORE \u2014 Aviation and tourism-related stocks in Singapore tanked on Monday (March 16) as investors reacted to additional travel restrictions imposed by the Singapore Government over the weekend in a bid to slow the Covid-19 outbreak. \n Analysts say the death knell was the extension of the restrictions to travellers from member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), which are Singapore's closest neighbours \u2014 and include some of the world\u2019s busiest air routes. \n It was a bloodbath for the Straits Times Index (STI) on Monday, with aviation and tourism stocks particularly hard hit. It came amid massive selloffs on stock markets around the world as fears over the economic impact of Covid-19 verge on full-blown panic. \n Singapore Airlines slumped 6.34 per cent to end the day at S$6.74, a more than 15-year low. SIA last traded at this level in October 2004. Genting Singapore, which owns Resorts World Sentosa among other leisure industry properties, slid by 5.88 per cent to S$0.64. \n Far East Hospitality Trust dived 10.38 per cent to S$0.48, while CDL Hospitality Trust sank 10.71 per cent to close the day at S$1. \n Both counters are business trusts that have hotels in their portfolios. \n The STI, as a whole, lost 5.25 per cent, ending the day at 2,495.7 points. \n On Sunday, the Government announced that all travellers entering Singapore with recent travel history to Asean countries, Japan, Switzerland or the United Kingdom in the previous 14 days will be issued with a 14-day stay-home notice. \n Singaporeans are also advised to defer all non-essential travel abroad with immediate effect, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said. \n About 40 per cent of international arrivals into Changi Airport are from Asean countries, almost four times more than Chinese travellers, said Mr Paul Chew, head of research at Phillip Securities. \n Asean comprises Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, Brunei, Myanmar and Singapore. \n \u201cBy default, half of the business disappeared overnight. It\u2019s quite devastating,\u201d he said. \n In 2019, three flight routes within Asean were among the world\u2019s top five busiest flight routes of the whole year, according to travel data provider OAG. \n The Singapore-Kuala Lumpur route topped the list at 30,187 flights, while the Singapore-Jakarta route came in third at 27,046 flights. \n The Kuala Lumpur-Jakarta route took fifth spot at 19.741 flights every year. \n Already, Singapore has progressively banned travellers from China, Iran, Italy, France, Germany, South Korea and Spain from entering the country. \n These newest restrictions on Asean nationals, would \u201ckill a lot of business travel\u201d, said Mr Terence Wong, founder of Azure Capital. \n \u201cMost of them are intra-Asean travel, probably just in the country a day or two right? There is no reason why you want to be subjected to a 14-day stay-at-home requirement,\u201d he said. \n Ms Pan Jingyi, market strategist at IG, said that the market selloff is not just due to restrictions imposed in Singapore. \n Australia and New Zealand, which are destinations close to Asean, have also put up restrictions as part of their containment efforts. \n \u201cThere is a consolidated effort across the board,\u201d she said. \n Yet while the market is down dramatically, analysts to whom TODAY spoke said investors should exercise caution and not rush in just because share prices look very cheap. \n While Asian countries, such as Singapore, are generally perceived to be doing a better job at containing the Covid-19 outbreak, Ms Pan noted that financial markets here are still influenced externally, particularly with what\u2019s going on in the United States. \n Over the past week, financial markets in the US have suffered whiplash, rising and falling dramatically \u2014 but the net movement is a huge dive, from above 29,000 points in mid February to just above 22,000 in early trading on Monday. \n Last Thursday, the US market suffered its single largest percentage fall \u2014 9.5 per cent \u2014 since Oct 19, 1987 when the US market lost 25 per cent in a single session. \n \u201cThe outlook for the US market in the short-term, and I mean in the next one month, the outlook is not so positive. I don\u2019t recommend trying to catch this falling knife at this point in time,\u201d said Ms Pan. \n Mr Wong also warned not to jump into the market as there might be more downside risk in the future. \n However, Mr Chew said it is a good time to buy though his advice would be to pace the investments as the situation is still deteriorating. \n \u201cThe market will remain weak until we reach a peak in the number of new patients\u2026 Whenever the numbers rise, the market will take it that the detrimental economic impact will be more entrenched,\u201d he said. \n \u201cThe positive side is we see that the virus can be contained but at the cost of huge economic damage.\u201d \n \u00a0"}, {"content": "What if the virus reaches Africa? The new corona virus has already reached four continents: From China, people have carried it to other parts of Asia, to Australia, Europe and North America. But it has not yet arrived in Africa. But what if? The pathogen, which has already killed 500 people and infected tens of thousands, would hit countries here whose health systems are as weak as perhaps nowhere else in the world. In the worst case, this could mean an epidemic with hundreds of thousands of infected people and many thousands of deaths. Many regions in sub-Saharan Africa are already facing major problems: epidemics of malaria, HIV and tuberculosis and an increase in chronic diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure are not only weakening people, but also overloading countries where there are clinics, doctors and nurses and medical care is lacking. Even if they have difficulties with numbers and predictions, many experts are very afraid of this scenario. At the meeting of the Executive Council of the World Health Organization on February 3, the mood among the African member states was very nervous, report those present. And John Nkengasong, who heads the African Union&#39;s epidemic protection agency, which was founded only three years ago, told ZEIT ONLINE between two conference calls: &quot;We are faced with an unprecedented danger.&quot; During the Sars epidemic in 2003, the countries of sub-Saharan Africa were largely spared, only South Africa registered a single case. With the new corona virus, however, nobody should hope that it will go so smoothly - the connections between China and many African countries have become too close. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese guest workers work on the African continent, and thousands of African students travel to China every year on a university scholarship. Air traffic from Africa to China and back has increased sevenfold in the past ten years. At the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organization WHO an accumulation of pneumonia of unknown cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Just a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days later, a group led by virologist Christian Drosten from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers are provisionally calling 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. The Chinese authorities suspect the source of the pathogen to be a food market in Wuhan, where not only fish and seafood but also exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected. Both Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic in 2002 and 2003, around 8,000 people were infected and more than 750 died. Between its discovery in 2012 and the end of 2019, around 2,500 people were infected with the Mers virus, and every third person died from it. In total, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example. Several thousand people have now become ill in China, some of them - most of them probably with previous illnesses - died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first cases of infection outside of China became known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been to Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who was returning from Wuhan, and on January 24, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia, which can be fatal. Since it is a viral disease, antibiotics won&#39;t help. It is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after a dozen or so cases among medical personnel became known. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. As it announced on January 24, the World Health Organization currently expects that an infected person will infect an average of 1.4 to 2.5 other people. If these numbers prove to be true, the virus is less contagious than Sars and so is the flu. The WHO recommends following general hygiene rules: You should wash your hands often and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals. It is not yet possible to say with certainty. The World Health Organization announced on January 28th that around a fifth of the reported cases would become seriously ill from the virus, so if in doubt they would have to be treated in intensive care. According to reports, the first fatalities were patients, some of whom had serious previous illnesses. People with previous illnesses are also particularly at risk from other infectious diseases - such as the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, i.e. change their genetic makeup. That can make them more dangerous to people in the course of an outbreak - but also the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate that is as high as that of the Sars outbreak. Many countries on the continent have strong economic ties with China. Kenya and Ethiopia, for example. For Ethiopia, China is the most important economic partner with a trade volume of more than five billion US dollars. In Kenya, the Chinese government sponsored one of the largest infrastructure projects in the country&#39;s history, a high-speed train that connects the capital Nairobi with the coastal metropolis of Mombasa. The train is part of the New Silk Road Initiative launched by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013. In order to establish trading bases around the world, China is investing trillion euros in infrastructure projects. And last week there were several suspected coronavirus cases in both Ethiopia and Kenya, says Michel Yao, who is responsible for emergency programs at WHO Africa, on the phone. &quot;We&#39;ve had a lot of alarms,&quot; \u200b\u200bsays Yao. But that is a good sign, because it shows that the surveillance systems are working in many places. But is that true? Or have there been cases in individual African countries that no one has registered? A report by the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board published in 2019 found global gaps in the preparation for epidemics, and a study by the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins University showed that the worst-prepared countries are almost all in Africa. There is actually a lack of everything: laboratories to detect pathogens, isolation rooms and personnel. But first things first: In order to nip an epidemic as early as possible in the bud, you first need good reporting systems. Because the faster cases are detected, the fewer people can infect the infected. John Nkengasong says the African Disease Control Agency has already set up a task force to help countries do this. In addition, every country should have a rapid reaction force in place, and infected people are already being searched for at all airports using questionnaires and temperature scanners. Such a screening would be carried out anyway because of the Ebola outbreak in the Congo, which has been going on for a year and a half. How well these measures really work in the event of a corona case is difficult to say. It certainly also depends on which country in sub-Saharan Africa is confronted with the first coronavirus cases. Some countries - such as Ghana or Nigeria - are better prepared for this than regions where war is raging and governments are unstable, such as South Sudan or the Central African Republic. There, for example, the virus should have almost free rein. Finding new cases will not be easy either, says G\u00e9rard Krause from the Helmholtz Center for Infection Research: &quot;In large parts of Africa, people first think of malaria when someone has a fever.&quot; It is also about training health professionals so that in addition to diseases such as malaria, Lassa, Ebola and meningitis caused by meningococci, the coronavirus can also hide behind a fever. Krause has been helping to set up a system called Sormas in Nigeria and most recently in Ghana since 2017. You have to imagine it as a platform that digitally connects all those involved in a health system: the laboratory, the district doctor, the health worker in the village and the health authority. For example, if a health worker suspects an infection with the new coronavirus, puts it on a tablet and takes a blood sample, Krause explains, different things happen at the same time: The laboratory is notified that a sample is on its way. The health authorities and the district doctor receive an alert, and the health worker is instructed to isolate the suspected case and search for people with whom it has dealt. If a suspected case can be found, the question remains how it will be confirmed. At the beginning of February, there were only two laboratories in all of Africa that test patient samples for the 2019-nCoV virus. The samples from a suspected case in Ivory Coast had to be sent to Europe first, explained Michael Yao, ZEIT ONLINE. It took days until it was clear: false positive. In the coming days, twelve laboratories in sub-Saharan Africa will be able to test for the new corona virus, says Yao. John Nkengasong expects it will soon be available in 15 to 20 countries. Finding patients quickly and then isolating them is even more important in large parts of Africa than anywhere else. Most of the health systems in Sub-Saharan Africa are likely to be too weak to take care of the sick in the event of a major coronavirus outbreak. There are no nationwide quarantine stations with ventilation machines that are needed in the event of severe pneumonia caused by the coronavirus. In addition, there is a shortage of skilled workers in almost all sub-Saharan African countries. While there are statistically about 42 doctors for every 10,000 people in Germany, in Ethiopia it is exactly one, in Somalia it is only 0.2 *. In many countries the most elementary things are missing, says political scientist Ilona Kickbusch, who advised the federal government on global health issues: &quot;It starts with protective gowns and medication.&quot; There are also logistical problems in many countries with weak health systems. Bringing respiratory masks to affected areas, for example, can then take days - far too long for the contagious coronavirus. The weakness of some health systems was also the main reason for declaring an international health emergency, said WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on January 30th: &quot;We do not know what damage this virus can do if it gets into a country with a weaker health system. We must act now to prepare for this possibility. &quot; John Nkengasong says: &quot;I can only call on the international community to help African countries now - and not wait until the continent is completely overwhelmed.&quot; Most countries&#39; health systems would not be able to withstand an outbreak like the one in China. The Gates Foundation, which has invested millions in global health for years, has already pledged 4.5 million euros to Nkengansong&#39;s agency to take action against the new coronavirus. On February 5, the foundation then announced that it wanted to invest a further 90 million euros to fight the coronavirus, around 18 million of which will go to African countries. Some African countries such as Sudan explicitly asked for help on February 4th at the meeting of the Executive Council of the WHO. &quot;On the one hand, it was about training specialists in the prevention and treatment of the coronavirus,&quot; says Mathias Bonk from the Institute for Global Health in Berlin. And on the other hand, the fact that they need materials such as test kits, masks and protective suits. A strategic plan specially tailored to the new coronavirus, which the WHO presented this week, is intended to solve some of these problems. John Nkengansong of the African Disease Control Agency also spoke to the World Bank and asked the US and China public health authorities for logistical help. The Americans in particular had often helped in past health crises in Sub-Saharan Africa. But what if the US itself experiences a severe coronavirus outbreak? This fear is also worrying many at the moment: that the classic donor countries could be so busy with outbreaks of the virus that they can no longer help. Michel Yao says the WHO emergency team is also in contact with non-governmental organizations such as the Red Cross and Doctors Without Borders. In some places, if the virus reaches them, African states could benefit from such pre-existing partnerships. If the worst comes to the worst, Ebola treatment centers in the Congo could be converted into places where people with a coronavirus infection are isolated and treated. Ilona Kickbusch also emphasizes that not only money and relief goods are needed, but also a strategy for explaining measures such as quarantine and patient isolation to the people in the affected areas. In previous Ebola outbreaks, this turned out to be a problem: men in yellow protective suits, as many villagers must have presented themselves, came, took healthy people with them and brought back the dead. Of course, this gave rise to conspiracy theories, which made it even more difficult for treatment teams to win the trust of the population. G\u00e9rard Krause from the Helmholtz Institute for Infection Research is meanwhile in contact with various African countries. They are thinking of using its Sormas system just like Ghana and Nigeria. There, the system helped in 2017 and 2018 to get a monkey pox outbreak under control, says Krause. Even if it could be too late for the new coronavirus: The next epidemic with a new pathogen is sure to come. An ever more closely networked Africa should prepare for this.

Wuhan, in China\u2019s Hubei province, is the epicenter of the disease.\nThe two planes in Wednesday\u2019s airlift arrived at Travis Air Force Base in northern California, where 178 passengers from one plane disembarked to begin two weeks of round-the-clock health screening while barred from contact with the general public.\nNone of the group showed signs of disease, except for a small child who developed a fever during the flight and was taken to a nearby hospital with its mother for further testing and medical treatment in isolation, officials said. The other evacuees at Travis will be housed in a hotel on base.\nAfter refueling, the second evacuation plane flew on to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, near San Diego, arriving with 167 passenger. Of that group, three adults and a child \u201cwere determined to have a fever or a cough that warranted them being transported to a local hospital for further evaluation,\u201d the CDC said. The rest were placed under quarantine at two housing sites on base.\n\u201cBecause these individuals were in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, where there is intense and escalating community-wide spread of this novel coronavirus, we consider them at high risk of exposure,\u201d said Dr. Christopher Braden, deputy director of the CDC\u2019s National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases.\n\u201cWe are in a critical time period in the international spread of the virus, and this action is necessary to try to prevent the spread here,\u201d Braden told reporters during a briefing at Miramar.\nHe stressed that the CDC\u2019s strategy of early detection and containment of individuals who are sick or at high risk of exposure has been successful in preventing widespread transmission in the United States so far.\n\u201cIf there were ongoing community spread of this virus we would know it, and that\u2019s not happening,\u201d Braden said. \u201cSo right now, in the United States, communities across this country are at very low risk of being exposed to this virus, including in San Diego and including on this base.\u201d\nThe United States and other countries have stepped up efforts to evacuate their citizens from China, where the coronavirus outbreak has killed more than 500 people, most in and around Wuhan, and infected more than 28,000.\nTwelve cases have been confirmed in the United States, none fatal. The latest patient, reported in Wisconsin on Wednesday, is isolated at home and \u201cdoing well,\u201d the state health agency said in a statement.\nAs with nine other U.S. cases documented to date, that person fell ill after traveling to China and was exposed to known cases there, the state health department said. Just two confirmed U.S. coronavirus cases were transmitted person-to-person within the United States - both between spouses.\nThe protocols in place at Travis and Miramar were previously instituted at March Air Reserve Base near Los Angeles, where the first group of Americans airlifted from Wuhan landed last Wednesday and are midway through their quarantine.\nThe CDC said the government expects to fly additional groups of Americans and their families from China to other U.S. military bases designated for quarantine in Texas and Nebraska.\nAs part of a U.S. public health emergency declared on Jan. 31 in response to the coronavirus crisis, the Trump administration has barred U.S. entry of all foreign nationals who have recently visited China.\nThe CDC also has ordered a mandatory two-week quarantine for all U.S. travelers who have visited Wuhan or anywhere else in China\u2019s Hubei Province during the past 14 days. Americans who traveled elsewhere in mainland China are subject to two weeks of self-quarantine and monitoring.\nAll commercial flights carrying Americans home from China will be directed to one of 11 U.S. international airports, where passengers will be screened by the CDC.\nThe State Department also has issued a \u201cDo Not Travel\u201d advisory warning U.S. citizens against visits to China."}, {"content": "taiwan embraces cute mascots for virus prevention campaign.

When the severe acute respiratory (Sars) epidemic ended in 2003, many people in China thought that the government had learned its lesson. \n Sars was the most serious epidemic the country encountered in the reform era, killing 349 people in China. \n The government was roundly criticised for its cover-ups in the early phases of the epidemic, leading to some frantic bureaucratic reshuffles, greater transparency and an expensive control and prevention system for infectious diseases. \n In March 2019, director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention Gao Fu confidently predicted that China would never again suffer from another Sars-like epidemic. \n Mr Gao is facing a storm of anger for this prediction since the outbreak in December 2019 of new coronavirus Covid-19, which has caused infections and deaths than Sars. \n As of March 7, according to the World Health Organization, Covid-19 has caused 3,073 deaths and infected 80,813 people in China, with hundreds of thousands more under medical observation. \n A medical and humanitarian tragedy has wreaked havoc in Wuhan city and Hubei province, the epicentre of the epidemic. \n A widely circulated social-media article describes 11 striking mistakes China has repeated this time around. \n The most grievous failings are the government cover-ups and censorship in the early phases of the epidemic which cost the country a precious three weeks in January to fight the virus. \n The most notorious cover-up surrounded Dr Li Wenliang, the now renowned whistle-blower who drew attention to early cases of Covid-19 infection. \n The police admonished him for warning people about the virus on social media and he later died from the infection himself. \n As news of his death began to circulate online on the evening of Feb 6 Feb, there was an outpouring of mourning and anger \u2014 too much for the censors to manage. \n Dr Li is already a martyr in the eyes of his mourners. But will the present crisis tragically embodied by his death spur China to learn any real lessons? \n Leaning from history is one of the most difficult skills for humankind to master. \n German philosopher Hegel once cynically remarked that \u201cthe only thing we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history\u201d. \n Twentieth-century American philosopher George Santayana offered a dark warning that \u201cthose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it\u201d. \n The value of historical learning is just as venerated in the Chinese tradition. The great 11th-century classic work of Chinese historiography Comprehensive Mirror to Aid Governance by Zi Zhi Tong Jian trawls the entirety of Chinese history up to that point for lessons in politics and governance. \n Courageous Chinese intellectuals are signing online letters calling for the authorities to respect freedom of speech, supposedly guaranteed by the country\u2019s constitution. \n They believe that if freedom of speech as an individual right were protected, voices like Dr Li\u2019s would have been heard more widely and effectively, perhaps forestalling the spread. If Dr Li\u2019s death led to real freedom of speech in China, that would be a lesson well learned. \n But there is no sign as yet of such learning taking place. No sooner had demands for freedom of expression gained traction than they too fell victim to censors. \n Information control is hardening, not loosening. Truthful depictions of the tolls of the crisis in Wuhan are condemned as rumours and swiftly deleted. \n This happened to Fang Fang, a resident of Wuhan and professional writer whose first-hand blogs of the humanitarian disaster unfolding in her city have gripped millions of readers. \n The length to which the censors have gone to eliminate dissent is extraordinary. On Feb 22, authorities killed an article run by the official Xinhua News Agency for its assertion that \u201cthe sky is not going to fall upon the telling of truth\u201d. \n A more promising avenue for learning is governance reform. This is where most Chinese discussions on managing the epidemic are centred. \n Various experts are weighing in on the need for institutional reform. Unlike Western commentaries which tend to blame the authoritarian system of President Xi Jinping, Chinese scholars raise a multitude of questions beyond politics. \n These include concerns about state\u2013society relations, centre\u2013local relations and the role of social organisations (including non-governmental organisations) and professional groups. \n While the rigidity of the Chinese system and the consequent governance failure are part of their criticisms, their comments are more nuanced and fine-tuned. \n Some of these views may reach the very top of the Chinese system, but it is unclear how the leadership will learn from this crisis. \n There are likely to be plenty of technical fixes, such as those recently announced by President Xi. \n But will the learning be so deep as to inaugurate systemic governance reforms and ensure long-term progress? \n As China continues its fight against Covid-19, the best hope is that the country can learn real lessons from this crisis and prove Hegel wrong.

He recalled the SARS episode in 2003, a virus from the same family that also originated in the Asian giant. &quot;In this sense, the crisis caused by SARS lowered China&#39;s GDP by 1.1% and Hong Kong&#39;s by 2.5%, while it only had an impact of 0.1% on the US GDP&quot; , says the AXA economist. Preliminary calculations by Standars &amp; Poor&#39;s coincide with this: the rating agency suggests that a 10% drop in the affected sectors would reduce GDP growth in the Asian country by 1.2%. However, the AXA Investment analyst recalls that since then China&#39;s weight in the world economy has grown significantly, so the contagion in the world economy should probably be greater. Although it should be emphasized that at this time it is still too early to know if SARS and its economic effects constitute the correct precedent for evaluating the coronavirus \u201d.

He said he believes the number is \u201cactually much higher\u201d. \n However, he told Mr Lim that the MFA was given a variety of reasons for why they chose not to return. \n Some of them said that their livelihoods depend on them remaining in China. Others have families there and feel an obligation to look after their extended families. \n \u201cThere were others \u2014 perhaps not so much now, but in the earlier phase of the crisis \u2014 who were worried even about travelling, making the journey to Wuhan and therefore decided that they would stay in place.\u201d \n Said Dr Balakrishan: \u201cThe key point is this: We will remain in touch, we will do our best to help and it would also help if they e-register with us because that gives us an immediate direct line to them, and similarly for them to us.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"content": "Olympic boxing qualifiers in Wuhan NIXED!. \nQualifying boxing matches for Asia and Oceania for the 2020 Olympic Games that were set to take place in China's Wuhan next month have been cancelled due to fears over the new flu-like coronavirus, Japan's Kyodo news agency said on Wednesday.\nBoxing preparations for the Games have already been upended after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in June took over the competition and suspended the international boxing federation due to issues with its finances and governance.\nThe IOC have instead set up a task force, led by its member and International Gymnastics Federation head Morinari Watanabe, to organise the boxing events.\nThe Kyodo report cited organisers as the source of the news.

The Wuhan coronavirus has not only isolated the 46 million people who live in the blocked cities of the Chinese province of Hubei, the focus of the epidemic. After the World Health Organization (WHO) declared an international health emergency on Thursday, it is all of China that is increasingly disconnected from the rest of the world. Numerous airlines have been rushing to cancel their Chinese routes. Different countries have announced the closure of their borders for those who have been in that country in the last 14 days, including third-country nationals. Within China, the situation that 2019-nCoV has created does not subside. The number of infected is around 14,380; fatalities reach 304; 163,000 people under observation, of whom 19,544 are suspected of being infected. The positive news: the number of cured patients, 328, exceeds the number of deceased. Early this Sunday, the Philippine Department of Health announced the death of a 44-year-old man of Chinese nationality from the coronavirus. The outbreak has already reached 24 countries, accumulating more than 150 cases, including one in Spain. Only Africa and South America are still free of the virus. A situation that, according to the United States, justifies a declaration of a &quot;public health emergency&quot; in its territory. This country - the first to announce the repatriation of its citizens in Wuhan after the abrupt closure of that city on the 23rd - will close its borders to any foreigner who does not have family ties to citizens or permanent residents of the United States and who has been in China. in the two weeks prior to arrival, the maximum incubation period. The veto will take effect this Sunday. In addition, US airlines have also announced the temporary suspension of their flights to China. Other countries have done the same. This Saturday the announcements of the withdrawal of flights multiplied. To those already known by British Airways, Iberia or Lufthansa, the Australian Qantas, the Vietnamese airlines or the flag companies of Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan or Iran were added. Travelers who have passed through China in the last two weeks will also not be admitted to nations such as Australia, El Salvador, Mongolia, Italy or Singapore. The measures have caused deep discomfort in the Chinese government, which is trying to tackle the epidemic as soon as possible and without regard to costs. Beijing wants to make it clear that mistakes such as the management of SARS - the epidemic similar to the current one that killed almost 800 people worldwide in 2003 - will not be repeated. &quot;You do not need to panic unnecessarily, or take excessive measures,&quot; said the Chinese ambassador in Geneva, Xu Chen, at a press conference. The WHO, the diplomat stressed, continues to emphasize that it has &quot;full confidence&quot; in the ability of the world&#39;s second largest economy to resolve the crisis. This UN organization does not consider it necessary to restrict travel or trade with the Asian country. For this country, the closure of borders or the mass departure of foreigners from Wuhan represents a vote of no confidence in its control measures and its health system, despite the saturation and lack of protective material that the government itself has admitted . In many cases, bureaucratic obstacles have delayed foreign repatriation flights for hours or days. Despite this, a second plane chartered by France landed this Sunday at the Istres air base, in the south of the country, with 250 foreigners of 30 different nationalities repatriated from Wuhan, two days after the arrival of the first 180 French citizens since the city identified as ground zero for the coronavirus. None of the new passengers, 65 French and &quot;many Europeans,&quot; according to Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, showed symptoms when boarding the flight. Even the first returnees have not developed the disease so far, added Secretary of State Adrien Taquet. While the foreigners were scheduled to be sent to their countries of origin - including Belgium, Sweden and Norway - according to an undisclosed protocol, the 65 French will be distributed among the holiday center 30 kilometers from Marseille where the first returnees are and a firefighting school near Aix-en-Provence totally isolated and accommodated for their arrival, according to the authorities. To some extent, there is no doubt that there is a political component, and not just a health one, in some of the decisions to close borders or keep them open. Despite numerous recommendations from medical specialists, and having already confirmed 13 cases in its territory, the Hong Kong government has so far refused to completely close the border. Yes, it has suspended ferry or high-speed train connections and reduced the number of flights to mainland China. Medical staff unions are threatening to go on strike on Monday if the head of government, Carrie Lam, does not declare a complete shutdown. Other countries with great economic dependence on China have decidedly sided with this power. Pakistan is reluctant to evacuate its university students in Wuhan, despite calls from students, to show &quot;solidarity&quot; to the government in Beijing. A similar argument is used by Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen. At a press conference in Phnom Penh on Thursday, he insisted that his nationals in China, including Wuhan, \u201chave to stay there to help the Chinese people fight this disease. We must not flee from the Chinese people in these difficult times. But the measures of the United States, in particular, threaten to open another front in the difficult relations between the two great powers, which had signed a truce in their trade war that had lasted almost two years in December. Before the announcement of the border closure, this week the Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross, assured that the coronavirus in China benefited the United States as it would force companies to remove their supply chains from the Asian country. &quot;The words and actions of some US officials are neither based on fact nor adequate,&quot; Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement. \u201cJust as the WHO ruled against travel restrictions, the United States was quick to take the opposite path.

WUHAN/BEIJING (CAIXIN GLOBAL) - The Chinese doctor who was punished by police for trying to warn the world of the emergence of the new strain of coronavirus died on Friday (Feb 7) from the disease. He was 34. \n Dr Li Wenliang, one of the whistle-blowers on China's coronavirus, officially known as 2019-nCoV, died at 2.58am on Friday in the Central Hospital of Wuhan, Hubei province, the epicentre of the epidemic, the hospital said early on Friday. \n The end came following extraordinary efforts to keep the critically ill doctor alive in the hospital's intensive care unit (ICU). \n Caixin learnt\u00a0that treatments included a procedure known as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (Ecmo), which circulates blood through an artificial lung back into the bloodstream, starting at around 9pm on Thursday. \n News of Dr Li's death broke at around 10pm on Thursday. But the Central Hospital later said on its official Weibo account that a medical rescue effort was still under way. \n Around midnight, a nurse at the hospital told Caixin outside the ICU that Dr Li \"won't make it\". \n Dr Li disclosed\u00a0on his social media account last Saturday that he had been diagnosed with a 2019-nCoV infection, most likely as a result of treating patients, but said he planned to return to work after recovery. By Wednesday, his condition had worsened, he told Caixin over WeChat. \n \"I haven't felt as good the last couple of days,\" he said. \"It's getting harder to breathe.\" \n An ophthalmologist in Wuhan, Dr Li received national attention after China's top court on Jan 28 criticised Wuhan police for reprimanding eight Wuhan citizens for \"spreading rumours\" about an illness in late December, in a commentary on its official WeChat account. \n Dr Li is considered to be one of the eight, although the police did not identify who specifically they had accused or punished. \n On Dec 30, Dr Li sent a message to his medical school alumni WeChat group, warning that the ophthalmology department in his hospital had put seven patients from a local seafood market into isolation wards after they were diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars). \n A screenshot of the message was leaked, and Dr Li was summoned by the hospital's inspection unit for a talk. Later, on Jan 3, he was called in and reprimanded by local police for allegedly spreading rumours online and disrupting social order. \n The commentary posted on the social media account of China's Supreme People's Court said that in retrospect, the eight Wuhan citizens should not have been punished, as what they said was not entirely false. \n \"It might have been a fortunate thing if the public had believed the 'rumours' then and started to wear masks and carry out sanitisation measures, and avoid the wild animal market,\" the commentary said. \n Dr Li told Caixin in an interview on Jan 30 that he had been worried the hospital would punish him for \"spreading rumours\" but felt relieved after the top court publicly criticised the police. \n \"I think there should be more than one voice in a healthy society, and I don't approve of using public power for excessive interference,\" Dr Li said. \n A few days after the police summons, Dr Li treated a patient who initially came in for glaucoma but later had a fever. A lung scan showed viral pneumonia. \n On Jan 12, as he felt unwell and was suspected of having contracted the virus, he was moved to an isolation ward, Dr Li told Caixin. His parents were also infected and sent to the hospital. \n On Jan 30, Dr Li said his test result had come back negative, but he remained in the isolation ward. \n He said he did not plan to go through official judicial channels to get an explanation, saying that it would be troublesome for him and the public security bureau. \n \"It's more important that people know the truth,\" Dr Li said. \"Justice is less important to me.\" \n He did take the opportunity, however, to clarify that rumours saying his medical licence was suspended were not true. \n As of Friday morning, China confirmed more than 31,000 coronavirus cases, and the epidemic's death toll had risen past 600. \n This story was originally published by Caixin Global."}, {"content": "Lufthansa will stop 150 planes due to the drop in air traffic.

The legendary Viswanathan Anand's return to India has been put on hold over the restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic. He is expected to \"wait and watch\" with regard to his travel plans.Anand would also be busy with his commentary stint for a website for the FIDE Candidates tournament beginning in Russia on Tuesday.Meanwhile, India's No 4 chess player Adhiban Baskaran, who is back in India after playing three back-to-back tournaments, is happy that he would be getting a break.\"I am a bit tired after playing back-to-back tournaments. First I want to take rest and be at home with my family. Then I will train. I needed a break but I didn't expect to be for two to three months!\"Apart from training, I will be playing online tournaments,\" he added.Adhiban had played the Gibraltar Open and the Aeroflot Open in Moscow and in between featured in the national team championship.The Indian women's No 2 D Harika, who recently participated in the FIDE Women's GP Series event in Lausanne, Switzerland is back in the country and wants to use the break to train.\"Yeah, it will be a break and I will use this time for to work on chess and train myself.

Each week, TODAY\u2019s long-running Big Read series delves into trends and issues that matter. This week, we look at what drove Singaporeans across the island to wipe supermarket shelves clean of daily essentials earlier this month, and what it says about the population\u2019s resilience in times of crisis. This is a shortened version of the full feature, which can be found here. \n SINGAPORE \u2014 While Singaporeans have earned a reputation for being kiasu (Hokkien for the fear of missing out), the scene that played out on Feb 7 at supermarkets across the island was something no one has witnessed here before \u2014 not even during the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) crisis in 2003 or the H1N1 pandemic in 2009. \n Hours before, the Ministry of Health (MOH) raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (Dorscon) alert level from Yellow to Orange. \n The risk-alert level was raised after several novel coronavirus cases were detected in the Republic without any links to previous cases or travel histories to China. \n To allay public anxiety, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong made a speech a day after the panic buying, assuring Singaporeans that there was no need to panic as the city was not being locked down, and there was ample supply of food for everyone.\u00a0 \n Now that a sense of normalcy has returned, questions remain to be answered: What caused all that panic-buying over that fateful weekend, which had left some quarters fuming \u2014 and embarrassed \u2014 over the behaviour of \u201cugly Singaporeans\u201d, and others to question whatever happened to decades of efforts aimed at building a resilient society? \n And what does it say about Singaporeans, many of whom have stoically and quietly got on with their lives, despite the uncertainty and disruptions to daily life?\u00a0 \n Customers picking out instant noodles and other non-perishables at Giant Supermarket in Beauty World Centre on Feb 7, after the Dorscon alert level was changed to Orange. Photo: Raj Nadarajan/TODAY \n THE SITUATION ELSEWHERE \n So far, apart from Singapore, there have been no reports of panic buying in places outside of China.\u00a0 Residents in Thailand for example, which has 33 confirmed cases as of Friday, told TODAY that the situation was calm and there has been no run on daily essentials. \n Some experts believe that events in Hong Kong, which was gripped by scenes of panic buying recently, had influenced Singaporeans\u2019 behaviour.\u00a0 \n Speaking to TODAY, Mr Wong Bai Chun, a Hong Kong citizen, said that two weeks ago, there was a brief but acute shortage of toilet paper and other paper goods in the territory, which was sparked by an Internet rumour that the Chinese spring holiday was being extended and there would be insufficient supplies of such products. \n OTHER TRIGGERS \n Negativity bias \n A spokesperson for the Singapore Psychological Society (SPS) council said this is a phenomena where our brains tend to focus more on negative information than positive ones. \n \u201cOur brains are hardwired to register negative stimuli more readily and also to dwell and worry on them for a longer period of time,\u201d the spokesperson told TODAY. \n Self-preservation and groupthink \n Whenever there is a life-threatening epidemic or emergency, the notions of safety, protection, and self-preservation usually come into play. \n \u201cResearch suggests that when people are in panic, the thinking part of our brain gets hijacked by the emotional system and we start to act illogically,\u201d said the spokesperson. \u201cOur ability to decide on our own is minimised.\u201d \n The spokesperson added that people tend to follow others in the hope that the latter could get them out of a dangerous situation. \n In Singapore\u2019s case, this could be a possible reason why people started to hoard or buy things impulsively if everyone else around them was doing the same, or if they were told to do so on social media platforms. \n Social-media \n Mr Lars Voedisch, the managing director of public relations firm PRecious Communications, said the panic-buying is triggered by one or two initial incidents which then get amplified by social media. \n \u201c(This leads) to a snowball effect of more and more people thinking of it, then hearing from the first people acting on their fear, sharing about it and through that fuelling the whole panic,\u201d he said. \n Singapore Management University sociologist Paulin Straughan said it did not help that the public was seeing these images circulated on social media late in the night. As a result, these became the abiding images for many Singaporeans overnight.\u00a0 \n \u201cFor the next 12 hours, the shelves remain empty (in their minds),\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s 12 hours of festering, and it entrenches (the fear that there are no supplies).\u201d \n Agreeing with Mr Voedisch, she reiterated that while technology has helped to disseminate information a lot faster, it has similarly allowed misinformation to spread just as quickly as well. \n This was not something that Singaporeans had to worry about during the past virus outbreaks, she added. \n Empty shelves at Fairprice Finest in Bukit Timah Plaza on Feb 7, after the Dorscon alert level was changed to Orange. Photo: Raj Nadarajan/TODAY \n PUBLIC COMMS \u2018COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER\u2019\u00a0 \n Communications experts told TODAY that the panic-buying in Singapore might have been avoided if the information disseminated by the authorities had been clearer.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \u201cThe problem with the message was that it was too bureaucratic at the start,\u201d said Nanyang Technological University (NTU) Assistant Professor Liew Kai Khiun.\u00a0 \n \u201cMuch of the Government\u2019s message involved military terms (and) colour codes,\u201d said Asst Prof Liew, who teaches at the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information (WKWSCI). \n Prof Straughan agreed, noting that the definition of Dorscon Orange was not explained enough as well. \n Dorscon is a colour-coded framework that shows the current disease situation.\u00a0 \n Orange refers to a situation in which a virus is spreading in Singapore but not widely, and is being contained. Previously, the risk assessment level was at Yellow, signifying that the virus was severe and could infect from person to person, but was chiefly occurring outside Singapore. The highest level, Red, indicates that the virus is spreading widely and can result in major disruption such as closing schools. \n \u201cSome people didn\u2019t know what it meant. All they saw was the visual,\u201d said Prof Straughan. \u201cThere are four levels. Green, Yellow, Orange and Red. Red is bad, everybody knows that right? Green is good. Now Orange. It is closer to Red than it is to Green. So visually, it lights up all your flags.\u201d\u00a0 \n Asst Prof Liew pointed out while the message from the authorities was accurate, it did not cater to the layman. To that end, they could have used dialect or Singlish to reach out more effectively, he noted.\u00a0 \n During the Sars outbreak in 2003, local sitcom character Phua Chu Kang was used to educate Singaporeans on the importance of washing their hands.\u00a0 This, he said, was an effective way of reaching out to the public, and many people still remember it today. \n A leaked MOH press release a few hours before the official Dorscon Orange announcement, which left many befuddled, might have also fuelled the public panic.\u00a0 \n The press release was circulated on social media and through messaging platforms such as WhatsApp. \n Up till this incident, Prof Straughan felt that the Government had been doing well in being upfront with Singaporeans about the virus situation. But when the press release was prematurely leaked out, it created some confusion.\u00a0 \n She said it did not help that recipients of the leaked document were initially told by others that it was fake news, only to be informed by the authorities a few hours later that it was indeed true.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Such contradictory information would have led some to question if the authorities were trying to hide something, she said.\u00a0 \n The authorities have yet to announce the source of the leak, but Mr Chan said on Feb 9 that the various agencies involved in tackling the virus will remind their staff that they have a professional responsibility not to prematurely share information that has not been finalised. \n Despite these short-comings in public communications, some of the experts felt that Mr Lee\u2019s nine-minute long speech on Feb 8 went some way in restoring some sense of normalcy.\u00a0\u00a0 \n The SPS council spokesperson said Mr Lee\u2019s message gave people very concrete actions that \u201chanded back a measure of control to people whose sense of control felt threatened\u201d. \n Mr Voedisch\u00a0said having the Prime Minister step in to address the public helped, because it went beyond technocratic statements and directly addressed what people were concerned with. \n \u201cWhile authorities should not get emotional when communicating, they have to be empathetic appealing to the hearts and minds of the audience,\u201d said Mr Voedisch. \n However, he was uncertain if an address by Mr Lee to the public at an earlier juncture would have helped.\u00a0 \n Instead, he said that the authorities should have foreseen the responses from the public as part of proper scenario planning with \u201cready-to-go action plans\u201d. \n Also, they should have anticipated and addressed the public\u2019s concerns and fears across the different platforms, he added.\u00a0 \n  \n Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in a recorded message which was televised a day after Singapore raised its Dorscon alert level to Orange.\u00a0Photo: MCI \n \u200bHERE COMES THE GOOD \n Still, despite the panic buying grabbing the headlines, Mr Chan and other government leaders took pains to point out that a large majority of Singaporeans had been \u201ccalm and rational\u201d.\u00a0 \n Many Singaporeans had come forward to thank the cashiers and supermarket staff constantly working behind the scenes to restock the empty shelves, Mr Chan noted.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Countless others have also stepped in to do their part for their fellow citizens, with numerous ground-up initiatives started in the community. \n For example, TODAY had reported about two primary school girls who used their pocket money to buy and deliver breakfast to doctors and nurses. On Valentine\u2019s Day which fell on Friday, community group StandUpForSG also gave out \u201clove letters\u201d to frontline healthcare workers. \n QUIET RESILIENCE\u00a0 \n Away from the public spotlight and media glare, ordinary Singaporeans have got on with their lives, despite the disruptions and worries brought on by the Covid-19 outbreak.\u00a0 \n Scores of Singaporeans \u2014 such as taxi and private-hire drivers, as well as those in the retail and tourism industries \u2014 have seen their livelihoods taken a hit. Others have had to adjust to working from home as business continuity plans swung into place. \n Cleaners, for example, are putting in longer hours while healthcare workers not only have to work longer each day but are also putting themselves at risk on the frontlines.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \n A 23-year-old outbreak nurse who works with Covid-19 patients said that while her family understands the risks of her occupation, it does not stop them from worrying.\u00a0 \n \u201cMost nurses are worried too, but it\u2019s our job and this is what we do for a living,\u201d said the nurse, who wanted to be known only as Sharmaine due to the sensitivity of her role. \n When she was first assigned to handle suspected Covid-19 cases, Sharmaine said she was scared as no one knew what exactly they were dealing with.\u00a0 \n \u201cBut over time, I grew immune to it, even if a patient were to test positive for the virus. Now I don't feel so scared anymore.\u201d \n However, she feels disappointed at the discrimination against healthcare workers shown by some Singaporeans, even as many others expressed gratitude for their work. \n \u201cIt truly is demoralising when you hear of such incidents. We feel ostracised at times because all we want to do is perform our job and go home,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we continue to keep an open mind because we are the first line of defence.\u201d \n Some businesses have had to adjust their operating models due to the outbreak. \n Ms Jazz Chong, the owner and director of contemporary gallery Ode To Art, has noticed fewer people visiting the gallery as well as the Raffles City Shopping Centre, where the gallery is located.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \u201cWith the virus outbreak becoming more severe, we have now decided to take the extra measure of bringing the art to our clients directly,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they like the work then it can remain in their home, making it extra convenient for them as they do not even have to leave their house.\u201d \n Business owners like Ms Chong are hoping that people would continue life as normal, albeit taking the necessary precautions.\u00a0 \n Or as NTU\u2019s Asst Prof Liew put it: \u201cWe must have a courageous sense of normality and go on living life normally.\u201d\u00a0 \n Indeed, Prime Minister Lee noted on Friday that the Covid-19 outbreak is expected to last longer than Sars, with a greater impact already hitting the economy. \n But he stressed: \u201cWe have to keep Singapore going and we have to keep making a living. Life has to go on.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \n  \u00a0 \n \u00a0"}, {"content": "WRAPUP 9-Americans disembark from virus-hit cruise; China says new cases slow.

HONG KONG \u2014 The number of \"silent carriers\"\u00a0\u2014 people who are infected by the new coronavirus but show delayed or no symptoms\u00a0\u2014 could be as high as one-third of those who test positive, according to classified Chinese government data seen by the South China Morning Post. \n That could further complicate the strategies being used by countries to contain the virus, which has infected more than 280,000 people and killed nearly 13,000 globally. \n More than 43,000 people in China had tested positive for Covid-19 by the end of February but had no immediate symptoms, a condition typically known as asymptomatic, according to the data. They were placed in quarantine and monitored but were not included in the official tally of confirmed cases, which stood at about 80,000 at the time. \n Scientists have been unable to agree on what role asymptomatic transmission plays in spreading the disease. A patient usually develops symptoms in five days, though the incubation period can be as long as three weeks in some rare cases. \n One obstacle is that countries tally their confirmed cases differently. \n The World Health Organisation classifies all people who test positive as confirmed cases regardless of whether they experience any symptoms. South Korea also does this. But the Chinese government changed its classification guidelines on Feb 7, counting only those patients with symptoms as confirmed cases. The United States, Britain and Italy simply do not test people without symptoms, apart from medical workers who have prolonged exposure to the virus. \n The approach taken by China and South Korea of testing anyone who has had close contact with a patient\u00a0\u2014 regardless of whether the person has symptoms\u00a0\u2014 may explain why the two Asian countries seem to have checked the spread of the virus. Hong Kong is extending testing to airport arrivals in the city, even if travellers have no symptoms. Meanwhile in most European countries and the US, where only those with symptoms are tested, the number of infections continues to rapidly rise. \n A growing number of studies are now questioning the WHO's earlier statement that asymptomatic transmission was \"extremely rare\". A report by the WHO's international mission after a trip to China estimated that asymptomatic infections accounted for 1 to 3 per cent of cases, according to a European Union paper. \n \"The number of novel coronavirus (Covid-19) cases worldwide continues to grow, and the gap between reports from China and statistical estimates of incidence based on cases diagnosed outside China indicates that a substantial number of cases are underdiagnosed,\" a group of Japanese experts led by Mr Hiroshi Nishiura, an epidemiologist at Hokkaido University, wrote in a letter to the International Journal of Infectious Diseases in February. \n Based on their research, Mr Nishiura put the proportion of asymptomatic Japanese patients evacuated from Wuhan, ground zero of the outbreak in China, at 30.8 per cent\u00a0\u2014 similar to the classified Chinese government data. \n But official figures from South Korea\u00a0\u2014 which had carried out nearly 300,000 tests on all close contacts of its confirmed cases as of Wednesday \u2014 are the most comparable to China's. More than 20 per cent of the asymptomatic cases reported to the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention remained without symptoms until they were discharged from hospital. \n \"Korea currently has a significantly higher rate of asymptomatic cases than other countries, perhaps due to our extensive testing,\" Ms Jeong Eun-kyeong, director of South Korea's CDC, told a press briefing on March 16. \n Another useful point of reference is the data collected from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was quarantined for weeks in Yokohama, Japan. All of its passengers and crew were tested, with 712 people testing positive\u00a0\u2014 334 of whom were asymptomatic, according to official Japanese figures. \n An EU report has put the proportion of asymptomatic cases in Italy at 44 per cent, but in most parts of the country people without symptoms are not tested. \n In Hong Kong, 16 of the 138 confirmed cases as of March 14 were asymptomatic or presymptomatic, according to Mr Ho Pak-leung, a professor with the microbiology department of the University of Hong Kong. \n All of these numbers point to a significantly higher ratio of asymptomatic cases than indicated by data publicly released by China so far. There were 889 asymptomatic patients among the 44,672 confirmed cases as of February 11, epidemiologists from the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention wrote in a paper published online in JAMA Network Open on February 24. \n The WHO has said the role of asymptomatic transmissions in the spread of the disease was not clear, but carriers without symptoms were unlikely to be a key factor overall. \n However, some scientists are asking whether asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmissions have been underestimated. \n A joint study by experts in China, the US, Britain and Hong Kong estimated that undocumented cases of the pneumonia, mostly with mild or even no symptoms, were the source of infection for 79 per cent of documented ones before Wuhan was locked down on Jan 23. \n \"These undocumented infections often experience mild, limited, or no symptoms and hence go unrecognised, and, depending on their contagiousness and numbers, can expose a far greater portion of the population to the virus than would otherwise occur,\" the specialists from Columbia University, the University of Hong Kong, Imperial College London, Tsinghua University, and the University of California, Davis wrote in the report. \n A separate study by scientists from the University of Texas at Austin estimated that people who had not yet developed symptoms transmitted around 10 per cent of the 450 cases they studied in 93 Chinese cities. Their findings are awaiting publication in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. \n Mr Ho from the University of Hong Kong said some asymptomatic patients had a viral load similar to those with symptoms. \n \"Of course it is hard to say if they may be less infectious if they don't cough. But there are also droplets when you speak,\" he said, referring to how the respiratory virus is transmitted. \n Mr Benjamin Cowling, an epidemiology and biostatistics professor at the University of Hong Kong, said there was \"clear evidence that infected persons could transmit infection before symptoms appear\". \n \"There are many reports of transmission around one to two days before symptom onset,\" he said. \n A better understanding of asymptomatic cases could lead to adjustments in public health policy, experts said. \n \"The asymptomatic ratio ... could be higher among children than in older adults,\" Mr Nishiura wrote in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases. \"That would considerably change our scope of the outbreak, and even the optimal interventions can change.\" SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST"}, {"content": "Mask diplomacy. The airport fire brigade shot water fountains at the white Boeing 747, which landed at the airport in Li\u00e8ge, Belgium, last Friday. Then half a million respirators, countless bales of protective clothing and test kits for the coronavirus were unloaded, which were distributed to several European countries. In the days that followed, more machines came with urgently needed relief supplies. A donation from the Alibaba Foundation and the Jack Ma Foundation. On Wednesday, 300 Chinese doctors landed in Italy, the country currently worst hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. Also on board was Sun Shuopeng, Vice President of the Chinese Red Cross. The following Thursday he said at a press conference, according to media reports: &quot;Here in Milan, the area most affected by Covid-19, the lockdown measures are very lax. I can see that the public transport is still in operation, people are walking around, meet in hotels and don&#39;t wear masks. I don&#39;t know what people are thinking here. &quot; Such criticism is of course not a typical message from China these days. For the most part, unctuous words can be heard. China&#39;s Communist Party leader and President Xi Jingping, for example, cheered up Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez with the hopeful remark that &quot;after the storm comes sunshine&quot;. Not without adding that after the pandemic one should think about more intensive cooperation. In a telephone conversation with Italy&#39;s Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Xi spoke of a &quot;Silk Road to Health&quot; as part of China&#39;s &quot;One Belt, One Road&quot; initiative. A clear indication that aid to needy Europeans also has a geopolitical aspect (which of course does not make it any less valuable). The Chinese Silk Road Initiative is largely viewed critically in Europe, as expansionism and as a method to drive the participating countries into debt dependence on China. The picture should now brighten up and make us forget that the corona crisis had started with China&#39;s inaction and veiling tactics. The fact that China is currently pushing the mass production of protective masks to unimagined heights in order to make the material available worldwide is reflected prominently in the propaganda. &quot;Trump cannot keep his mask promise without Chinese factories,&quot; say the regime&#39;s websites. It is even scattered that the virus comes from the USA - a surprisingly clumsy answer to the attempts of the American president to use phrases like &quot;Chinese virus&quot; to instrumentalise the health catastrophe for nationalist purposes. Otherwise, however, China presents itself as a friendly great power full of humanity. And that works. For example with the old ally Serbia, whose President Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 is quoted as saying: &quot;There is no such thing as European solidarity. It is an old wives&#39; tale. We place our hopes in the only country that is able to deal with this difficult situation help: the People&#39;s Republic of China. &quot; There he hits a sensitive point. Didn&#39;t Germany initially forbid the export of respiratory masks to Italy, and isn&#39;t it the case that German intensive care units have free capacities a few kilometers from the distressed Alsace? And what happened to America, the land of care packages and raisin bombers? China wants to take on this role. Reinvigorated, equal to all in the world. That is the &quot;Chinese dream of the great national renaissance&quot;, the slogan of Xi Jinping. For thousands of years such a slogan has been issued in China for periods of rule, which is supposed to give the respective era its name. The concept of the Chinese Renaissance has a centuries-old tradition, but now it is said to have come to that under the leadership of the CPC. The Corona crisis seemed to shake this course hard at the beginning - but now Beijing is reversing the energy of this shock and wants to use it for its own ascent."}, {"content": "US advises citizens against travelling to China.

In the worst-case scenario, &quot;I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s got the flu, but it will slow down.&quot; For the president of the Portuguese Association of Travel and Tourism Agencies (APAVT), Pedro Costa Ferreira, in an interview with P\u00daBLICO/Renascen\u00e7a, who can hear the complete report this Thursday from 1 pm, regarding the new coronavirus, it is important are the \u201cnumbers\u201d and the \u201cfacts\u201d, following the advice to travelers from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the indications of the World Health Organization. The rest is \u201cnoise\u201d, he says, noting that, excluding China and part of Italy, there is no travel limitation. Since last weekend there has been literally panic in Europe, the number of countries affected is growing. France, Italy, now Spain, there is talk of too many canceled flights, too many customers who do not know whether or not to keep their trips. Is it scaremongering or is it enough to shake the sector? It&#39;s a little bit all of that. It&#39;s a bit of panic, of ignorance of the facts, but also a bit of the sector to be shaken. I have the feeling that the first thing we have to do before starting to talk about coronavirus is to get out of the \u201cdisco\u201d, there is a lot of noise. The media circus that is set up around this theme has produced a huge amount of noise and this noise has made it extremely difficult to configure, frame and relativize the entire problem. Let&#39;s configure the problem out of noise: what we have today and knowing that the numbers are very dynamic. About 80 thousand infected, about 2700 dead, which indicates a frankly low mortality rate, especially if compared to other similar events that had much higher mortality rates. We have almost 30,000 patients cured or recovered from the infection, something the media circus never points out. This Tuesday I was looking at a television that spoke of 80 thousand infected, 2700 dead and nothing else. It should be added: and 30,000 recovered. And then we have to relativize and frame it. Every year in Portugal about 3,000 people should die [from the flu], every year in Italy \u2013 where we count, at the moment we are talking, 12 dead \u2013 around 8,000 people die from the flu. Does this mean that we don&#39;t have any problems? Absolutely not. We have to frame it. I understand that you want to calm down, being the president of APAVT, but this Tuesday we heard a world expert who returned from China to say that the world is not prepared for such a thing. If the world is not prepared according to an expert, perhaps the sector should be prepared. But I am not saying that the sector is not ready. First of all, I&#39;m relativizing and pushing the circus away. Let&#39;s talk about numbers. This is not to say that we don&#39;t have a problem. But what is the main problem for now? It is the ignorance of the virus, its mode of transmission, its consequences, its timing of transmission, whether it is seasonal or throughout the year, it is unpredictability. It is the unpredictability that causes this chaos and panic. Regarding this unpredictability, I think there is a path, or several. I think there is a path that is the right one, that of rationality, that of prudence, and I would even say that of humility. Rationality: let&#39;s study, let&#39;s monitor, let&#39;s check the numbers, how is it being transmitted, where is this going to stop. For example, in China, recoveries are happening at a much higher rate than newly infected ones, which is a good thing. But in Europe we are starting a transmission process that will probably get worse in the next few days, which is a bad thing. We have to have some humility about this lack of knowledge. It is a certainty that within two months, most likely, we are not all cooped up at home without living, but our lives may be relatively affected. It is also perhaps a certainty that we are not going to have a normal life, but we can have a life very close to normal. What if we have a trip already purchased to China? If I have a trip in a fortnight, which I bought at a travel agency, is the agency available to reimburse me for the trip? It is not available, it is legally obligated and it already does. But is this for the whole year or for the short term? Talking about refunds has to be case by case. But there are some cases we can determine. Reservations made before the outbreak of the problem, which will be traveled until the end of March, can be refunded, are legally covered. In June, maybe they can&#39;t be refunded now, we have to wait for the evolution. And when do you consider the outbreak of the problem? I think it&#39;s December 31st. One thing is for sure, a trip that was booked yesterday is not refundable today. Even because a trip booked yesterday had to be provided by the travel agent, and that is what the good practices of the travel agency dictate, all the information to the customer. The customer will be aware of what he will find. And it&#39;s been reserved for Italy for eight days? Right now it&#39;s too early to say. If you go to Northern Italy, including Milan, the answer is very likely to be a refund. It&#39;s likely \u2013 but, again, it has to be case by case. When the reservation was made, what was the purpose, why did the person want to cancel. If it is only one flight, you are not entitled to a refund, you must have at least two services purchased at a travel agency. Only flights are not entitled to a refund. Never? Not even for China? Legally, it doesn&#39;t fit. What is covered by the law on travel agencies is that two services are sold at the same time, the flight plus hotel, the flight plus transfer. What we call organized trips. We always continue to talk about the short term, that is, still in the \u201cwait and see\u201d, both for the association and the agencies themselves. Are the decisions you referred to an association council to all agencies or can each agency decide otherwise? It is more than that. In the case of China, it is a case of force majeure, there is a disadvising on the communities&#39; portal, so if the trip is organized, and with more than one service, you are entitled to a refund. And it must be said that travel agencies are very prepared for this because they have insurance. A trip to Italy, today, to Milan, was booked before the outbreak of the problem and if it will be traveled until the end of March, this trip, if organized and booked in a travel agency, [is included]. If it was booked outside an agency it is not covered, it does not have any protection. The problems for travel agencies today are also the opportunities for travel agencies. It is in an agency that the consumer has the greatest protection. Between reason and some alarmism, which is natural, because we look at our interactive map on the P\u00daBLICO website, where we see each case arising and cases approaching and surrounding Portugal, people naturally get into some alarm . Will there be people already canceling trips to Europe, fearing the coronavirus? Are these people entitled to cancel the trip already? I would like to take the opportunity to speak in alarm, rightly or wrongly, that someone here has a duty to quote the World Health Organization: the current situation calls for facts, it does not ask for fear; it asks for science, it doesn&#39;t ask for rumors; it asks for solidarity, it does not ask for stigma. We started with the stigma of the Chinese, probably at the end of this process we will thank them for the way they solved the problem at their home. I wish something were happening in Portugal, that the Government had already adopted preventive measures, something like that? for the sector, it had an effect on trips to China, which ended, on trips from China to here, which ended. That&#39;s the effect until last week. And what was the biggest effect? The Chinese who didn&#39;t come? After all, the Chinese who didn&#39;t come. Although the Chinese outbound market is important and is growing, it has a share of less than 2.5% in the Portuguese market. And so it had the effect it had, it&#39;s a period, let&#39;s see when they come back. And if we talk about the destination China, it has even less effect. Because it is not a very important destination in the Portuguese market and because this moment is not a very important time for Portuguese holidays. Of course there are problems. If you ask me &#39;there are no reserves for China?&#39; \u2013 of course there are no reservations at the moment, there are cancellations, there will still be some cancellations. Are we expecting reservations for Italy this week? Of course there are no reservations for Italy this week, it seems logical to me. Will there be cancellations? There will be a lot of dialogue, \u201ccan I go?\u201d, \u201cshould I go\u201d?, \u201cshould I change my destination?\u201d, \u201ccan I change height?\u201d, \u201ccan I wait and see?\u201d, \u201chow long can I wait before whether or not to pay something without refund?\u201d, there&#39;s all this dialogue, but all this dialogue certainly doesn&#39;t include new reservations. Do we have a problem for Easter? It seems reasonable to say that yes, the sector will have a problem at Easter. The big reservations start now during March, Easter is in April and a peak of reservations is not expected with all this environment, which has not yet reached its peak. And the Easter effect? The Easter effect will have a negative effect on the sector. Because obviously, if there are no reservations and no travel, there will be less revenue, less invoicing. How much is Easter worth in the sector? Let&#39;s imagine that the crisis gets worse until Easter, what does that mean? Easter even for leisure is an important point. Let&#39;s say it&#39;s not critical yet. If we recover by the summer \u2013 and we had other epidemics where two months later things were cleared up \u2013 I think if we have a normal summer, the effects will be felt, but they won&#39;t be as significant. Can you count? I can&#39;t give an exact number. It is still possible to think of a year that is not absolutely negative, but opportunities will be lost at Easter and summer will soon be seen.

We are, as I said, in the area of \u200b\u200bunpredictability, we do not know what will happen in the next few days, in the next few weeks. If you were my travel agent and I arrived right now and asked \u201cI&#39;m thinking about traveling Spain, France, Italy, I don&#39;t know, for Easter, for the summer, I don&#39;t know. Is it worth booking the trip? What right do I have if I cancel it?\u201d We must have some organization here, I wouldn&#39;t say legal, but at least mental. We have to follow and strictly follow the information on the communities&#39; portal, these are the basis of whether or not there is a legal possibility of reimbursement, if the communities&#39; portal does not advise travel to a certain region or if it does. The great truth is that the portal, today, because of the coronavirus, does not advise for China and for the North of Italy and Milan, some areas of the South, for young people. Apart from these two regions, today there is no limitation on travel. The health ministers of Italy and the countries that border Italy met and decided that the borders remain open. WHO says there are no restrictions on travel or trade. Turning to Tourism as the spring of growth in recent years, still with the coronavirus: if this crisis reaches the summer, or if it extends beyond the summer, do you think that the engine of our growth has a fluke? I don&#39;t know if it has the flu, but it will slow down. In worst-case scenarios, the entire world economic model will struggle. At the outset, and ahead of all, tourism, because it is the movement of people and, therefore, if tourism will have difficulties in the worst scenarios, we will also have to reduce speed in Portugal. I&#39;m not saying it will happen. In the worst case scenario, or many more negative scenarios, it definitely does."}, {"content": "WRAPUP 11-Coronavirus cases in China's Hubei fall for second day, Apple and markets feel impact.

There were 109 deaths on the same day. \n So far, the number of infections worldwide has climbed to more than 77,000 in some 30 countries and territories and killed more than 2,300 people, mostly in China. \n At a briefing in Geneva yesterday, Dr Ghebreyesus described the trend in cases having no clear links to China as \"very worrisome\", citing the growing number of cases in Iran in the past few days. Five people out of its 28 cases have died. \n \"Our biggest concern continues to be the potential for Covid-19 to spread in countries with weaker health systems,\" said Dr Ghebreyesus, noting that the agency is helping to prepare African countries for \"the potential arrival of the virus\". \n It has identified 13 priority countries in the continent that have direct links to China and has appealed for US$675 million (S$944 million) in funds to support the most vulnerable. \n WHO has been advising countries on screening, testing, contact tracing and treatment. \n WHO's warning comes as a study in Britain predicted that as many as two-thirds of infections exported from China may have gone undetected globally, which had the potential for a massive outbreak. \n Using data from air travel, scientists at Imperial College London found some countries to have identified far fewer cases than expected based on the number of passengers arriving from Wuhan. \n Lebanon confirmed its first case on Friday, a 45-year-old Lebanese woman who had travelled from Qom in Iran. New cases were also reported in the United Arab Emirates, which yesterday confirmed that an Iranian tourist and his wife had been sickened by the coronavirus, raising the total number to 13. \n Iran's outbreak is worrying public health officials there and in the WHO. The authorities have not confirmed its origin, but one health official has suggested that it could have been imported by Chinese workers. \n Neighbouring countries have started to take action. Turkey has said all travellers from Iran will have to undergo medical checks, while Bahrain has issued an advisory against travel there. \n Northern Italy is also on alert after two deaths were caused by the coronavirus - a 75-year-old woman yesterday in Lombardy and a 78-year-old man the day before in Veneto. The region has 51 cases now. \n Meanwhile, a WHO-led mission in China for the past week travelled to Wuhan yesterday. State media Global Times said the expert team will collect wild animal samples to trace the origin of the new coronavirus and check quarantine conditions in the makeshift hospitals."}, {"content": "Lung Disease In China: What Travelers Need To Know. Cases of the fatal lung disease are increasing in China. With the current wave of travel for the Chinese New Year on Saturday (January 25), the risk of transmission continues to grow. Hundreds of millions of Chinese are on the move during the largest annual mass migration. In the fight against the spread, the Chinese capital Beijing has now canceled all major events and temple festivals on the occasion of the Chinese New Year celebrations. The city&#39;s tourism authority said it was meant to &quot;reduce the number of people gathered&quot;. Health is paramount. The instruction applies immediately and also applies to the traditional fairs in the temples of the capital, which usually take place over the two-week New Year celebrations. The Imperial Palace and parts of the Great Wall are also closed to visitors from Saturday. The Badaling wall section in the north of Beijing, which is popular with tourists, is affected. China&#39;s health commission said the initial infections were linked to a now-closed fish market in Wuhan that also sold wild animals. The majority of the infections continued to be concentrated in the 11 million metropolis. In the fight against the spread of the lung disease, strict movement restrictions have been imposed on around 37 million people in the severely affected central Chinese province of Hubei. As the youngest three metropolises in Jingzhou (5.6 million inhabitants), Xiaogan (5 million) and Dangyang (470,000), public transport and trains to other locations have stopped, the city governments reported. With the provincial capital Wuhan, at least eleven cities have been practically sealed off. Coronaviruses often cause harmless diseases such as colds - but according to the Berlin virus researcher Christian Drosten, analyzes of the genome showed that the pathogen is a Sars variant. Sars stands for &quot;Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome&quot;. A Sars virus originating from China in 2002/2003 caused a worldwide pandemic with 8,000 infected people, and around 800 people died. At Frankfurt Airport, travelers from and to the region near Wuhan will be informed about the symptoms and how they should deal with them, said a spokesman for the health department in Frankfurt. This happens, for example, on large information boards at the airport or on the website of the Federal Foreign Office. \u201cYou just have to see how things develop globally and then of course we have to adjust the information, too,\u201d the spokesman continued. Travel and behavior recommendations are currently sufficient. In the case of justified suspicions, affected people would be isolated and observed, the office said. German tour operators and Lufthansa are in an exchange with the authorities because of the spread of the new lung disease in China. &quot;The organizers are in close contact with the Federal Foreign Office and are closely monitoring developments,&quot; said a spokeswoman for the industry association DRV. According to a spokesman, Lufthansa has not yet felt any reluctance on the part of customers to make bookings. You can start planned emergency measures at any time, said the spokesman. According to its own information, the German industry leader Tui currently has very few guests in China. &quot;Accordingly, we are currently not registering any increased need for information,&quot; said a spokeswoman. Guests on site were informed about the travel and safety instructions from the Foreign Office via SMS. According to its own information, DER Touristik has only received a few inquiries from customers about the corona virus. The organizer Berge &amp; Meer has not had any increased inquiries or cancellation requests either. Travelers to China cannot cancel their package holidays for free just for fear of the new lung disease. Withdrawal from the travel contract purely out of fear is currently not possible without cancellation fees, explains travel law expert Sabine Fischer-Volk from the Karimi law firm in Berlin. &quot;An exception would only exist if a quarantine measure were declared for a specific travel destination or hotel so that you cannot go on vacation there or only with great restrictions,&quot; says the lawyer. This is currently not the case. Fischer-Volk advises travelers to China to inform themselves regularly about the travel and safety information of the Foreign Office (AA). This currently does not advise against traveling to China - an important condition for being able to cancel package holidays free of charge. The travel and safety information only states: &quot;Avoid contact with sick people and all animals, avoid markets with animal products and pay more attention to your hand hygiene.&quot; In addition, travelers should see a doctor immediately if they have a fever and signs of a Develop respiratory infection. Individual travelers who do not want to fly cannot have the ticket costs reimbursed by the airline. The EU prevention authority ECDC initially sees a moderate risk that the pathogen will be introduced into the European Union. This was announced by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control in Solna, Sweden. To protect against lung disease, North Korea initially closed its borders to foreign tourists, according to travel agencies. North Korea has stopped allowing tourists to enter the country since Wednesday (January 22), announced the China-based agencies Young Pioneer Tours and Koryo Tours on their websites. There was initially no official confirmation from North Korea. China&#39;s Asian neighbors, the USA and Great Britain have now introduced fever controls when entering from Wuhan because of the lung disease. According to the Ministry of Health in Rome, Italy is also relying on controls at the airport in Rome to check possible suspected cases on board planes from Wuhan. And Russia tightened controls at all border posts with China. The French airline Air France has canceled all direct connections to and from Wuhan in China for the time being. The airline is adhering to the measures recommended by authorities such as the World Health Organization (WHO), Air France said. Istanbul Airport had thermal imaging cameras installed to scan passengers from China.

There are currently 60 million Italians under a tight quarantine. A country closed at home that can only leave for \u201cproven health or work reasons\u201d, as dictated by the decree of the Giuseppe Conte government. These are extreme measures to try to stop the progression of the new coronavirus, because in 17 days Italy went from having three patients diagnosed with covid-19 to the country with the highest number of cases and deaths outside China: 17,660 and 1266, respectively . As if the pressure these numbers put on the health system and government weren&#39;t enough, Italy is also facing an above-average fatality rate \u2014 around 7% of the infected (or at least diagnosed) population has died. On January 31, 2020, the first cases were identified in two Chinese tourists visiting Rome. And this number has remained stable for weeks, with authorities trying to understand the path of those infected in Italy. Only almost 20 days later, on February 22, the first case of internal contamination would be confirmed in a city about 60 kilometers from Milan: small Codogno, in Northern Italy, confirmed six cases of infection by the new coronavirus and decided to close it. all public and private places, including schools, services and supermarkets. The next day, the \u201calarms\u201d sounded again: Italian authorities confirmed two deaths from coronaviruses and about six dozen new infections, when 24 hours earlier there were fewer than ten confirmed cases. And since that day the numbers keep multiplying. The northern regions of Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia Romagna are being the most affected by the outbreak \u2014 85% of those infected are from that region, which registers around 90% of deaths. But the virus has already been confirmed in all 20 regions of the country. This Thursday, the death toll from the new coronavirus outbreak rose by 250, to 1266 deaths. The total number of cases rose to 17,660\u200b, from 15,113 this Thursday, an increase of 16.8%. It is the biggest daily rise in absolute numbers since the contagion accelerated. For the situation to have evolved so quickly, Italian authorities believe that the new coronavirus entered the country long before the first case was detected, according to Time magazine Flavia Riccardo, an investigator in the Department of Infectious Diseases of the National Institute of Italy Health. \u201cAll of this happened just when we were dealing with our flu A spike, when citizens were showing symptoms of that pathology\u201d, she says. Even before the first cases were confirmed, there was an unusually high number of patients with pneumonia in a hospital in Codogno and these health facilities may have become hotbeds of infection. As the virus has spread undetected for a few weeks, authorities believe this may be one of the reasons why Italian numbers for covid-19 are so high. \u201cBy the time we realized [the disease], there were already many active transmission chains,\u201d the researcher tells Time. In addition, advances the specialist, Italy may have a greater number of registered cases as a result of carrying out more rigorous tests than other countries: it has already tested more than 40 thousand people. However, that doesn&#39;t explain the lethality. For now, the pattern of deaths recorded in Italy is similar to that seen in China. It is the elderly and those with associated diseases such as cancer, diabetes, respiratory diseases and others that depress the immune system that are being most affected. As revealed by the National Institute of Health, the average age of patients with coronaviruses who died in Italy is 81 years. But the numbers are high: Germany, with 2369 infected, adds only five deaths, while Italy, with a similar number (2502 to March 4) already registered 80; Spain has 4209 cases and 120 deaths, while Italy with 4636 cases (on March 7th) had 197 deaths. As was already known, the elderly are one of the groups that are particularly susceptible to the virus and Italy has the oldest population in Europe, with 23% aged 65 and over. In global terms, it is second only to Japan. But can this help explain such a high number of deaths? Constantino Sakellarides, former Director-General of Health, retired professor at the National School of Public Health and current member of the National Public Health Council, explains that the Italian case may be related to the fact that Northern Italy is one of the most \u201c prosperous\u201d of the world. \u201cIt is no coincidence that this happened in Milan and not in Lisbon. It has to do with the intense relations that China maintains with the most developed business centers in the world, including Milan\u201d, says the expert, noting that, however, the fact that Northern Italy is a rich region makes it very well served in terms of health services. Regarding the deaths associated with the virus and registered to date in the country, particularly among the elderly, the public health specialist prefers to focus on the method of calculating deaths. \u201cIt is difficult to associate deaths in Italy only with an aging population, and we cannot speak of a mortality rate, but a fatality rate. The first is the number of deaths in the population and the second is the victims in the infected population. When we say 6%, we are talking about 6% of the sick and not 6% of the Italian population, as that would be a catastrophe\u201d, explains the former Director-General of Health. Constantino Sakellarides argues that the situation in Italy is \u201c dramatic,\u201d but it is difficult to base it on just the aging of citizens, because South Korea or Japan are as (or more) aged. According to the latest figures released, so far South Korea has registered 7979 confirmed cases and 66 deaths, and Japan has detected 639 cases and 16 deaths. The specialist rejects seeing Italy as a special case compared to other exporting countries of the new coronavirus and considers that the Italian case, the most serious of the epidemic outside China, is related to \u201cthe loss of containment capacity\u201d. In light of recent measures taken by the Italian government in a relentless effort to contain the virus, Constantino Sakellarides explains that while other countries have had time to learn and study how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted, Italy has not had that luck. . \u201cWe, like other countries, have already had more than two months of Chinese experience and other weeks of Italian experience in dealing with the virus. The Chinese measures were very strong, and most countries are not able to implement efforts of this type\u201d, explains the public health specialist. \u201cItaly did not have the benefit of learning from countries other than China and I have the impression that it acted later; hence, now several countries are acting earlier, as is the case of Portugal.\u201d According to the expert, this virus, due to its transmissibility and its incubation period, is circulating much faster than it seems. \u201cThere is a small increase at the beginning and then an exponential increase, as we have already seen in several countries, such as Spain, Denmark and Italy itself. We took the decision to close many public spaces and schools at 80 cases, Denmark at 500, and Spain at 2000. Although \u201cbenefit\u201d is a dangerous word at this point, we were able to benefit from the examples and make such a decision much sooner of others\u201d, believes the former consultant of the former Health Minister. \u201cAnd we must not forget that social pressure also has a great impact on these political decisions to close schools and other public spaces\u201d. According to a study published this Friday in the scientific journal The Lancet by two Italian researchers, the number of infected patients since February 21 in Italy is following an &quot;exponential trend&quot;. &quot;If this trend continues for another week, there will be 30,000 infected patients,&quot; they advance. According to this research, which provides up-to-date information about the Italian scenario, the average age of people who died in the country was 81 years and more than two-thirds of these patients had diabetes, cardiovascular disease or cancer. &quot;While it is true that these patients already had other health problems, it is also important to note that, because of SARS-CoV-2, they needed respiratory support and would not have died otherwise,&quot; the study said. Of the first 827 fatalities, 14.1% were over 90 years old, 42.2% were between 80 and 89 years old, 32.4% between 70 and 79 years old, 8.4% between 60 and 69 years old and only 2, 8% between 50 and 59 years old. In Italy there are around 5200 beds in intensive care units. Of these, researchers say, more than a thousand are already being occupied by citizens infected with SARS-CoV-2. \u201cIn the near future, this number will progressively increase to the point where thousands of beds will be occupied by patients with covid-19. As the mortality of critically ill patients is high, the number of infected people in Italy is likely to put great pressure on hospital intensive care, some of which do not have adequate resources or teams to deal with this emergency\u201d, they believe. the investigators. This factor can increase mortality. The two experts believe that the restriction measures must continue to be imposed so that what happened in China does not happen in Italy. \u201cIf the Italian outbreak follows a trend similar to that in China, we can expect the number of newly infected patients to start to decline. Likewise, we can predict that the cumulative curve of infected patients will peak 30 days later,\u201d suggest the authors. While other countries deal every day with new cases of SARS-CoV-2, China registered only eight new cases of infection this Friday, the lowest number since starting the daily count in January. Until midnight on Thursday (4:00 pm on Wednesday in Lisbon), mainland China had 3169 deaths and a total of 80,793 infected. But 62,793 people were discharged after overcoming the disease, to date, leaving 14,831 in treatment. The roles seem to have been reversed: in the face of imported cases, one of the priorities of the Chinese authorities is now \u201cto protect themselves against the importation\u201d of infections from other countries. The numbers have been falling sharply compared to last month, when the number of new cases rose to more than a thousand per day. National Health Commission spokesman Mi Feng said Thursday that the peak of the epidemic has passed in China, but that &quot;the rapid development of the epidemic abroad has brought new uncertainties.&quot; He subscribes to newsletters for free and receive the best of current affairs and the most in-depth works from P\u00fablico.

NEW DELHI - India could face between around 100,000 and 1.3 million confirmed cases of the disease caused by the new coronavirus by mid-May if it continues to spread at its current pace, according to a team of scientists based mainly in the United States.  \n The estimates reinforce concerns among some medical officials and experts in India that the country of 1.4 billion people could see coronavirus cases jump sharply in the coming weeks and put its health system under severe strain.  \n The scientists said projections could change as the country conducts more testing, while also putting in place stricter restrictions and measures to stem the spread of the virus.  \n \"Even with the best case scenarios, probably, you are in a very painful crisis,\" said Bhramar Mukherjee, a professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the University of Michigan who was involved in the study.  \n The study was carried out by the COV-IND-19 Study Group of scholars and scientists looking into the threat posed by the coronavirus, and COVID-19, the disease it causes, in India.  \n The analysis first appeared on Medium, a U.S. publishing platform, on Saturday.  \n India probably has only around 100,000 intensive care unit (ICU) beds and 40,000 ventilators, said Dhruva Chaudhry, president of the Indian Society of Critical Care Medicine, based on industry estimates and other data.  \n \"We can handle it if an even number (of cases) come over a period of time,\" Chaudhry said. But he warned that there was not sufficient infrastructure or staff to handle a sharp spike in critical patients.  \n India's federal health ministry and the Indian Council of Medical Research did not respond to questions about the forecasts.  \n  \n PARTIAL LOCKDOWN  \n So far, India has reported 471 cases of the coronavirus and 9 deaths, numbers dwarfed by countries like China, Italy and Spain, but which are nonetheless beginning to accelerate.  \n Authorities have imposed a lockdown across large parts of the country, including in the capital city New Delhi and the financial hub of Mumbai.  \n The original study was based on data up to March 16, but following a request from Reuters, the team updated their model using cases from Indian health authorities up to March 21.  \n The model was based on one used by colleagues to analyse the coronavirus outbreak in Hubei, China, and employed a set of equations taking into account the number of susceptible people, those infected and those who recovered.  \n That created a predictive model for case counts in India and provided projections under hypothetical public health interventions of varying intensities.  \n According to the estimates, the number of confirmed cases could rise to more than 4,000 by the end of March and to between 30,000 and 230,000 by end-April.  \n Although the researchers have not projected the number of fatalities, Mukherjee said India could be hard hit because of large numbers of people with existing conditions who were potentially more vulnerable to the virus.  \n  \n EARLY CONTAINMENT  \n India has tested around 20,000 individuals, and health authorities have said the virus has remained largely restricted to those who travelled to affected areas and others who came into direct contact with them.  \n India has shut down its massive railways network, banned all incoming international flights and has ordered commercial airlines to stop domestic operations from midnight on Tuesday.  \n But some health officials are concerned that individuals from high-risk areas may not have been caught by multiple safety nets, allowing the virus to spread.  \n Over the weekend, a group of federal lawmakers and bureaucrats in New Delhi were forced to self-quarantine after a Bollywood singer who travelled from London tested positive for the virus in a neighbouring northern state.  \n The singer had earlier been at an event attended by a member of parliament, who subsequently went to several meetings in New Delhi.  \n Mukherjee said India needed quickly to undertake large-scale testing and contact tracing for exposed individuals.  \n \"But if there is expanded community transmission, central lockdown may be the only way,\" she said.

The MSCI world index rose 0.4% in the first five sessions this month, after having sunk 8% last month, but the eurozone squares lost 0.08%, accumulating a 12% decline since the beginning of the year. Worst is Latin America, with the region&#39;s stock index falling another 5.1% last week after a 12% drop in February. These two regions reveal themselves as the weakest links in the current nascent financial crisis. Along with the oil market, where the price of a Brent barrel collapsed 6% in one session, last Friday after the OPEC cartel and Russia failed to reach an agreement on a global cut in black gold production. The price of the European reference barrel has already dropped 10% in March and 31% since the beginning of the year. The end of the OPEC+ alliance could lead to a price war between Riyadh and Moscow. Lisbon is in line with the Eurozone&#39;s negative trend with a 1.9% drop in the PSI 20 stock index in the first five sessions of March. The biggest European falls last week were registered in Athens, Milan and Madrid. In contrast, the indices for Asia Pacific (despite being the epicenter region of the new coronavirus epidemic) and for New York (where the world&#39;s two most important exchanges are located) recorded gains in early March of 0.6% in both cases. A slight recovery from losses in February of 6.1% and 8.3% respectively. This modest recovery is attributed to the effect caused by some coordination of key rate cuts by 10 central banks in the first week of March, with an emphasis on the US Federal Reserve (50 bps) and Canadian central banks (50 bp), Saudi Arabia (50 bp), Hong Kong (50 bp), Australia (25 bp) and Argentina (200 bp, ie 2 percentage points, from 40% to 38%). In terms of the budget, some countries (namely South Korea, Italy and the United States) and international organizations (such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund) came forward with a global package of 110 billion dollars (\u20ac97 billion), some a modest 0.1% of world GDP. The response from Europe (the eurozone and the United Kingdom) and Japan is still on hold. The Eurogroup is not expected to take decisions until the March 16 meeting. The German government is expected to announce measures on Monday. The most awaited monetary policy meeting next week takes place in Frankfurt when the European Central Bank (ECB) council discusses the response to the current unexpected crisis that has come to shuffle the &quot;pause&quot; announced by Christine Lagarde who hoped to have the year 2020 to carry out the strategic review of monetary policy... smoothly. Investors&#39; focus turns to Thursday when the French company explains what the 19 euro central banks have decided. The ECB meets against a background of the spread of the epidemic in Europe (with Italy quarantining 16 million inhabitants), a drop in inflation to 1.2% and the absence of a joint response from the European Commission and the Eurogroup. Compared to November 2011 when six G7 central banks coordinated action on monetary policy in the face of the crisis raging in the eurozone, the current response is very weak despite the International Monetary Fund (IMF) having revised downwards in just two weeks twice its global growth forecast in 2020 advanced in January. At the G20 meeting in Riyadh on February 22, the IMF also convinced those present that the crisis would be temporary and would behave in a &quot;V&quot; shape, implying a correction of just 0.1 percentage points in the 3.3% growth forecast that had been advanced in January. Last week, for the G7 meeting, the director-general of the Fund pointed to a cut in growth of more than four tenths, admitting that the world GDP could grow even less than the 2.9% of 2019, the fastest pace. weak since the world recession. The Fund&#39;s spring forecasts will only be advanced at the meeting - for the first time with virtual sessions - from April 13-19. Until then, a lot of water will flow under the bridges in a global context in which shocks on the world supply and demand side converge. The first data from China, released this weekend in Beijing, is worrying. Exports dropped 17.2% (in dollars) in the first two months of the year, according to the Chinese Customs Authority. From a trade surplus of US$46.79 billion in December last year to an accumulated deficit of US$7 billion in January and February, the first since 2012. Stopped container ships worldwide are at an all-time high, involving 2 million TEU (standard unit to calculate the volume of containers) in mid-February, higher than in the year of the 2009 world recession, according to French consultant Alphaliner. Volatility soared again this week in New York and on the stock exchanges of the European single currency area, reaching new highs since 2011, when the sovereign debt crisis of the euro peripherals. The VIX indices, which measure daily volatility on stock exchanges and give a dimension to the financial panic, set new nine-year highs last week - the VIX for the Wall Street S&amp;P 500 index hit 54.39 and that for the Eurostoxx index 50 (out of the top fifty listed in the euro zone) reached 46.6. In the public debt market, signs of panic continue. Investors continue the rush to safe havens such as German bonds and US Treasuries, &#39;paying&#39; to hold them (due to negative rates, in the German case) or for the first time accepting increasingly lower positive interest rates (in the case of the USA) . Yields on German 10-year bonds fell to negative lows of -0.75%. In the US, the rates on 10-year bonds set new historical lows at 0.6% and in the longer term, at 30 years, they collapsed to a low below 1.3%. In the opposite direction, the risk premium of the euro peripherals - including Portugal - has increased compared to the period before the shock of the Chinese coronavirus. Next Wednesday, the Portuguese Treasury holds an auction of bonds at 5 and 10 years, with market rates below those recorded in the last operations carried out in these terms by the Treasury and Public Debt Management Agency (IGCP). The 10-year auction is the first of the new line of bonds launched at the beginning of the year through a syndicated operation in which the Treasury paid an interest of 0.499%.

The International Olympic Committee and other bodies in charge of the qualifying tournaments for the Games have decided to change the venue of several pre-Olympic games: this has happened with some of women&#39;s basketball (from Foshan, China, to Belgrade, Serbia), boxing (the Asian qualifiers and Oceania, which have changed Wuhan for Amman, Jordan), or women&#39;s soccer (a qualifier between four teams, China, Australia, Taiwan and Thailand, moved from Wuhan to Australia). The Shanghai Formula 1 Grand Prix runs the risk of not being able to be held in the middle of next April, after the city announced the suspension of all sporting events. In a statement, the city&#39;s Sports Federation said that they suspend &quot;until the end of the epidemic&quot; all sporting events, &quot;performances, forums, exchanges abroad and other activities.&quot; The decision of the authorities of the metropolis comes at a time when the specialized press speculates about the possible cancellation or delay of the race. According to various media, the Formula 1 authorities will meet this Wednesday to decide whether the event, scheduled for the weekend of April 17 to 19, goes ahead or not. The International Automobile Federation recently announced the suspension of the Formula E race (the electric single-seater competition organized by the International Automobile Federation). It was scheduled for March 21 in the island city of Sanya, in southern China. In the statement, published last Sunday, the organization explained that it made that decision &quot;to guarantee the health and safety of traveling personnel, championship participants and spectators, who continue to be of vital importance.&quot; The Chinese Soccer Super League has been affected by the decision to postpone the matches of all competitions until further notice. The International Tennis Federation changed the venue for one tournament, that of the Asia Fed Cup Oceania group (from Dongguan, near Hong Kong, to Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan), before finally postponing it. The Alpine Skiing World Cup, scheduled for next week in Yanqing, north of Beijing, has also been canceled."}, {"content": "Virus: Marcelo emphasizes that \u201cno one is preserved\u201d and admits effects on the global economy.

Asked whether he considers that the Portuguese authorities are doing everything possible to prevent the spread of this virus in Portugal, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa replied: \u201cThere is a combination of objective and subjective factors.

BEIJING (XINHUA) -\u00a0China and Italy reaffirmed bilateral ties in a phone call between the two countries' foreign ministers, with Beijing offering to provide Rome with medical aid to help fight the coronavirus. Separately, eastern Zhejiang province donated\u00a0thousands of boxes of protective gear to help overseas Chinese in the European nation. \n In the phone call on Tuesday (March 10), Chinese State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said the two nations' friendship would see new progress as they work to tackle the fast-spreading virus. \n Mr Di Maio briefed on Italy's latest development on the epidemic prevention and control work, and thanked China for its support for Italy. \n Pointing out the severe situation in Italy at present, Mr Di Maio said the Italian government is paying close attention to and learning from China's successful experience in the battle against the virus, taking strong measures to prevent the spread of the disease. \n Italy is facing a shortage of medical supplies and equipment, said Mr Di Maio, expressing hopes that China would help resolve their urgent need. \n Overseas Chinese living in Italy have played an active role in the fight against the epidemic, said Mr Di Maio, adding that Italy will continue to take full care of their health and safety. \n Mr Wang said that as a good friend and comprehensive strategic partner of Italy, China fully understands the challenges Italy is confronting. \n The epidemic knows no border and is a common enemy of mankind, Mr Wang noted as he called for solidarity from the international community to combat the virus. \n Upholding the vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, China is dedicated not only to making all-out efforts to keep the Chinese people safe and sound, but also to making contributions to global public health security, Mr Wang said. \n China recently made donations to the World Health Organisation to support international cooperation on the Covid-19 fight. China is also offering help within its capacity to countries where the epidemic situation is severe or where medical conditions are poor, Mr Wang said. \n Noting that the Chinese people will not forget Italy's support when China was facing its toughest moment in the fight against the virus, Mr Wang said China is now willing to stand firmly by the side of the Italian people. \n Though China itself at present still needs a large amount of medical materials, the country, overcoming the difficulties, will offer Italy with assistance like medical materials including face masks, and accelerate and enhance the exports of supplies and equipment to meet Italy's urgent need, Mr Wang said. \n If the Italian side requires, Mr Wang said, China would like to send medical personnel to Italy to help combat the novel coronavirus. \n The Chinese cities and provinces that enjoy friendship relations with their Italian peers, as well as Chinese enterprises, will also offer support and aid to Italy, the minister added. \n Mr Wang said he believes the joint battle against the coronavirus will help deepen bilateral relations between the two countries, and enhance the friendship between the two peoples. \n China appreciates that the Italian side has paid high attention to the health and safety of the Chinese nationals in Italy, and hopes that Italy will continue to offer them necessary help and support, the minister said. \n Hand in hand, China and Italy will prevail over the epidemic eventually, Mr Wang added. \n On Wednesday, China's eastern Zhejiang province sent 3.86 million pieces, or 4,556 boxes, of protective gear to help overseas Chinese in Italy. \n A cargo plane loaded with 26.4 tonnes of disposable masks, N95 medical masks, goggles, latex gloves and other protective clothing left the provincial capital of Hangzhou for Europe at 5.50am, Xinhua reported.\u00a0 \n Zhejiang\u2019s first batch of donations for overseas Chinese came from people from all walks of life in the province. More than 300,000 Chinese people from Zhejiang live in Italy.\u00a0 \n \u201cSince the outbreak of novel coronavirus, overseas Chinese of Zhejiang origin have tried every means to purchase epidemic prevention materials and support their hometown to fight the epidemic,\u201d said Mr Zhang Weiren, vice-chairman of the Zhejiang Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese.\u00a0\u201cOverseas Chinese are now in difficulty, and their relatives in the motherland should give them the utmost support.\" \n Due to the suspension of direct flights between China and Italy, the donations would arrive first in Liege, Belgium, and then be transferred to Italy, said Mr Gao Kaiyong, deputy chief of the general office of the Zhejiang Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese. \n \u201cIf all goes well, the goods will arrive in Turin, Italy, this weekend,\u201d"}, {"content": "How do bats live with so many viruses?. If previous outbreaks of coronavirus are any indication, the Wuhan strain that is now spreading may eventually be traced back to bats. \n Dr Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance, who has been working in China for 15 years, studying diseases that jump from animals to people, said: \"We don't know the source yet, but there's pretty strong evidence that this is a bat-origin coronavirus.\" \n \"It's probably going to be the Chinese horseshoe bat,\" he added, referring to a common species that weighs up to 28g. \n If he is right, this strain will join many other viruses that bats carry. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle East respiratory syndrome epidemics were caused by bat coronaviruses, as was a highly destructive viral epidemic in pigs. One bat can host many different viruses without getting sick. \n They are the natural reservoir for the Marburg virus, and Nipah and Hendra viruses, which have caused human disease and outbreaks in Africa, Malaysia, Bangladesh and Australia. \n They are thought to be the natural reservoir for the Ebola virus. They also carry the rabies virus, but in that case the bats are affected by the disease. Their tolerance of viruses, which surpasses that of other mammals, is one of their many distinctive qualities. \n They are the only flying mammals, they devour disease-carrying insects by the ton, and they are essential in the pollination of many fruits, like bananas, avocados and mangoes. They are also an incredibly diverse group, making up about a quarter of all mammalian species. \n But their ability to coexist with viruses that can spill over to other animals, in particular humans, can have devastating consequences when we eat them, trade them in livestock markets and invade their territory. \n Learning how they carry and survive so many viruses has been a deep question for science, and new research suggests that the answer may be how the bats' evolutionary adaptations to flight changed their immune systems. \n In a 2018 paper in Cell Host And Microbe, scientists in China and Singapore reported their investigation of how bats handle something called DNA sensing. \n The energy demands of flight are so great that cells in the body break down and release bits of DNA that are then floating around where they should not be. Mammals, including bats, have ways to identify and respond to such bits of DNA, which might indicate an invasion of a disease-causing organism. \n But in bats, the scientists found, evolution has weakened that system, which would normally cause inflammation as it fought the viruses. \n Bats have lost some genes involved in that response, which makes sense because the inflammation itself can be very damaging to the body. They have a weakened response, but it is still there. \n Thus, the researchers write, this weakened response may allow them to maintain a \"balanced state of 'effective response' but not 'over response' against viruses\". \n How to manage and contain the current outbreak of the virus officially known as nCoV-2019 is, of course, of paramount importance now. But tracing its origin and taking action to combat further outbreaks may depend partly on knowledge and monitoring of bats. \n \"The outbreak can be contained and controlled,\" Dr Daszak said. \"But if we don't know the origin in the long term, then this virus can continue to spill over.\" \n Scientists in China were already studying the bats carefully, well aware that an outbreak like the current one would most likely happen. \n In the spring, in an article on bat coronaviruses, or CoVs, a group of Chinese researchers wrote that \"it is generally believed that bat-borne CoVs will re-emerge to cause the next disease outbreak.\" \n They added: \"In this regard, China is a likely hot spot.\" \n This was not clairvoyance, but conventional wisdom. \n Certainly rodents, primates and birds also carry diseases that can and have jumped to people; bats are far from alone in that regard. \n But there are reasons they have been implicated in several disease outbreaks and are likely to be implicated in more. They are numerous and widespread. While bats account for a quarter of mammalian species, rodents are 50 per cent, and then there is the rest of us. \n Bats live on every continent except Antarctica, in proximity to humans and farms. The ability to fly makes them wide-ranging, which helps in spreading viruses, and their faeces can spread disease. \n People in many parts of the world eat bats and sell them in live animal markets, which was the source of Sars and possibly the latest coronavirus outbreak that began in Wuhan. \n Bats also often live in huge colonies in caves, where crowded conditions are ideal for passing viruses to one another. \n In a 2017 report in Nature, Dr Daszak, Dr Kevin J. Olival and other colleagues from EcoHealth Alliance reported that they had created a database of 754 mammal species and 586 viral species, and analysed which viruses were harboured by which mammals and how they affected their hosts. \n They confirmed what scientists had thought: \"Bats are host to a significantly higher proportion of zoonoses than all other mammalian orders.\" Zoonoses are diseases that spill over from animals to humans. \n And they do not just survive the viruses they harbour. Bats are remarkably long-lived for small mammals. The big brown bat, a common species in the United States, can live nearly 20 years in the wild. \n Others live closer to 40. One tiny bat in Siberia lived at least 41 years. Animals like house mice live about two years on average. \n While the bats must be studied, their physiology understood, and the viruses they harbour monitored for the sake of public health, that does not mean that the bats are to blame for the outbreak. \n As others have pointed out, humans have encroached on the lives of bats, not vice versa. \n Dr Daszak stressed that stopping the sale of wildlife in markets is essential to curtail future outbreaks. But since such outbreaks are inevitable, he says, monitoring and studying wildlife, like bats, is equally important. \n He compared the situation to terrorism. Both terrorist attacks and disease outbreaks seem inevitable. To get a jump on them, he said, intelligence is vital. \n NYTIMES"}, {"content": "South Korean PM says \u2018turning point\u2019 near in coronavirus fight.

To find out which countries the virus could be more easily imported, scientists in Germany used a computer model. In the case of Portugal, the risk of importing the coronavirus is \u201cvery low\u201d, with the country in the 61st position on the list of relative risk of importing the virus. The Directorate-General of Health (DGS) also announced this Monday two more suspected cases of infection by the new coronavirus \u2013 there have been six so far \u2013 and one of them has already been negative, it was learned earlier in the evening. The second suspected case, which had been referred to the University Hospital Center of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o, in Porto, also had a negative result, informed the DGS this Tuesday, a few minutes after midnight. Cases of the new coronavirus have been confirmed in more than 20 countries. Even though the vast majority of cases are confined to China, concerns remain that they could spread even further across the world. In order to assess the risk of importing cases to other countries, a team from the Humboldt University of Berlin and the Robert Koch Institute, both in Germany, used a computer model, in which they considered the distribution of confirmed cases in China and the network of air transport from 4000 airports and more than 50,000 air routes. The closure of airports due to the epidemic has already been included in the model. It was concluded that Thailand (in addition to China) is the country most likely to have people arriving from one of the airports analyzed with coronaviruses.

Although it&#39;s been so much to talk about, we still don&#39;t know enough about the new coronavirus. Efforts have not been lacking and scientists around the world have been paying attention to the virus. Among the latest news is the publication of the complete biomolecular code of the virus. Samples of the new coronavirus have been processed in laboratories around the world and raw information about the genetic code has been sent to the repository of the US National Institutes of Health. From there, a team from the University of California at Santa Cruz (USA) collected information on 29,903 nucleotides \u2013 adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanine, basic chemical elements that make up the DNA molecule, represented by the letters A, T, C and G \u2013 and made it available in the public Genome Browser database. \u201cBy making the coronavirus data available in the Genome Browser at the University of California at Santa Cruz, this allows researchers to observe the structure of the virus and, even more importantly, investigate how they can attack it,\u201d says Hiram Clawson, a researcher at that university, in a statement. . How this coronavirus is transmitted has been another major issue. Coronaviruses are transmitted by respiratory droplets, direct contact with infected secretions and aerosols in therapeutic procedures that produce them, says DGS. But how long does it persist on surfaces and how can it be inactivated? Two professors at the University Hospital of Greifswald, Germany, tried to answer these questions. To find answers, they analyzed studies on the SARS and MERS coronaviruses. It was found that these viruses could persist on surfaces and remain infectious at room temperature, on average, between four and five days. \u201cLow temperatures and a high humidity in the air further increase their lifespan\u201d, indicates G\u00fcnter Kampf in a statement from his institution. As for the inactivation of the various coronaviruses, in tests with disinfectant solutions, agents with ethanol, common hydrogen peroxide or sodium hypochlorite were seen to be effective against coronaviruses. If these agents were applied in the proper concentrations, they would reduce the pathogen particles from one million to 100 in about a minute. For researchers, these results could be extrapolated to the new coronavirus. \u201cWe analyzed different coronaviruses and the results were similar\u201d, points out Eike Steinmann. This Tuesday and Wednesday, scientists, professionals from public health agencies, health ministers and research funders will meet in Geneva (Switzerland) to set priorities in research and development of drugs, diagnostics and vaccines for the coronavirus. This meeting, organized by WHO together with the Global Collaboration on Research for the Preparation of Infectious Diseases, will discuss the origin of the virus, identify gaps in knowledge or medical products that should be necessary to minimize the impact of Epidemic. &quot;The meeting is expected to produce a global research agenda for the new coronavirus,&quot; says the WHO in a statement. An international mission led by WHO also arrived in China this Monday to investigate the epidemic. Epidemiologists on this mission are trying to better understand how transmission occurs between people, how the virus is spread in hospitals or why some people die.

This Monday was also marked by the visit of the President of China, Xi Jinping, to several places in Beijing, namely to a community center, a hospital or a disease control center. Xi Jinping was always seen wearing a mask and his temperature was measured. At the hospital in Ditan, where patients infected with coronaviruses are being treated, Xi Jinping even participated in a videoconference with health professionals in Wuhan \u2013 the epicenter of the outbreak, which the Chinese President has not yet visited. This is considered a rare public appearance by Xi Jinping during the epidemic and occurred days after the death of doctor Li Wenliang, who tried to warn colleagues about the virus and was eventually punished for spreading rumors. The visit also took place on the day many Chinese return to work after an extended Chinese Lunar New Year vacation. Therefore, the WHO has already stressed that the number of cases outside of China can only be \u201cthe tip of an iceberg\u201d."}, {"content": "Vila do Conde creates a working group to react to cases of coronavirus. The municipality of Vila do Conde, in the Porto district, which is home to one of the largest communities of Chinese people in the country, created a multidisciplinary working group to act locally if coronavirus infections occur. The initiative came from the local authority, which this Monday brought together the various entities that make up the civil protection system, representatives of the local Chinese community and heads of schools and health units. &quot;Without alarmism, a working group was formed to act in case a suspicion or an outbreak of the disease in the county arises. It is just a preventive action, because we have to follow the protocols at the national level. Single actions do not work&quot;, said Elisa Ferraz, President of the City Council. In a meeting attended by the president of the League of Chinese in Portugal, Y Ping Chow, the mayor shared the concern for possible discrimination that could arise against Chinese citizens living in the municipality, calling for &quot;this should be avoided&quot;. &quot;Fortunately, we are not aware that this is happening, but we have to be careful and put aside discriminatory looks on Chinese people. In Vila do Conde, this community was welcomed and, in many cases, it is integrated into society, with children study in our schools,&quot; said Elisa Ferraz, estimating 1,500 Chinese living in the county. Elisa Ferraz also said that the Chinese community had conveyed to her some concerns about the way fears about the coronavirus have harmed sectors of the economy, including commerce, but stressed that this is not a priority for the municipality in addressing the issue. &quot;I know that the economic repercussions can be a problem, but our concern is with the general population and with public health. Everything else is secondary,&quot; said the president of the Chamber. The health delegate coordinator of the P\u00f3voa de Varzim/Vila do Conde Health Centers Group also participated in this meeting to formalize the working group, who stressed that in the municipality the device is ready to act in case of suspected cases, although not centering the issue in the Chinese community. &quot;I don&#39;t want to center the issue on the Chinese, as this can lead to racial phobias and, on the other hand, to negligence in relation to other possible infected people,&quot; said Lu\u00eds Castro. The health delegate also did not consider that the fact that the county is home to one of the largest communities in the country could leave Vila do Conde with greater exposure to the coronavirus. &quot;What was transmitted to us by the community is that most of the Chinese living in the region come from areas of China where the virus has not manifested itself. Perhaps there are people coming from places closer than China and at greater risk of being infected. We have no reason to look at this community with fear or suspicion&quot;, stressed the official. This working group, set up in Vila do Conde to monitor and act in possible cases of coronavirus infections in the municipality, will meet to assess preventive measures and outline strategies whenever necessary. China today raised to 362 deaths and more than 17,000 infected the balance of the outbreak of pneumonia caused by a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) detected last December in Wuhan, capital of Hubei province (centre), placed under quarantine. In addition to mainland China and the Chinese regions of Macau and Hong Kong, there are more confirmed cases of infection in 24 other countries.

A 20-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, travelled 400 miles(675 km) north to Anyang where she infected five relatives, without ever showing signs of infection, Chinese scientists reported on Friday, offering new evidence that the virus can be spread asymptomatically.  \n The case study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, offered clues about how the coronavirus is spreading, and suggested why it may be difficult to stop.  \n \"Scientists have been asking if you can have this infection and not be ill? The answer is apparently, yes,\" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Centre, who was not involved in the study.  \n China has reported a total of 75,567 cases of the virus known as COVID-19 to the World Health Organization (WHO) including 2,239 deaths, and the virus has already spread to 26 countries and territories outside of mainland China.  \n Researchers have reported sporadic accounts of individuals without any symptoms spreading the virus.

She remained asymptomatic and infected a bunch of family members and you had a group of physicians who immediately seized on the moment and tested everyone.\"  \n According to the report by Dr. Meiyun Wang of the People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University and colleagues, the woman travelled from Wuhan to Anyang on Jan. 10 and visited several relatives. When they started getting sick, doctors isolated the woman and tested her for coronavirus. Initially, the young woman tested negative for the virus, but a follow-up test was positive.  \n All five of her relatives developed COVID-19 pneumonia, but as of Feb. 11, the young woman still had not developed any symptoms, her chest CT remained normal and she had no fever, stomach or respiratory symptoms, such as cough or sore throat.  \n Scientists in the study said if the findings are replicated, \"the prevention of COVID-19 infection could prove challenging.\"  \n Key questions now, Schaffner said, are how often does this kind of transmission occur and when during the asymptomatic period does a person test positive for the virus.

GSK is working with developers by providing a technology that could make their vaccines more potent.  \n The virus, which emerged in December in China, has killed nearly 500 people and shows no sign of abating, with thousands of new cases reported each day, mostly in central China's Hubei province. But its spread to some 27 countries and regions has caused global alarm.  \n To be sure, companies developing treatments for patients who are already sick may be able to get a drug approved faster than a vaccine that would be given to healthy people. Even so, logistical and regulatory challenges remain, according to two executives at Gilead Sciences Inc <GILD.O>, which is working on an experimental antiviral treatment.  \n \"There is a distinction there between a therapeutic and a vaccine. Having said that, I think it is true that this won't be super fast and it will involve us investing at risk right now,\" said Gilead Chief Medical Officer Merdad Parsey.  \n Clinical trials for treatments can be smaller and of shorter duration than for vaccines, Parsey acknowledged.  \n Challenges in making sure therapies are effective and then scaling up production still remain.

With the genetic code in hand, scientists can start vaccine development without needing a sample of the virus.  \n Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is using Moderna's platform, said the agency is on the fastest pace ever to develop a vaccine candidate.  \n He hopes to have a vaccine available for initial safety testing within two and a half to three months from the time scientists determined the genetic sequence of the virus.  \n Novavax Inc <NVAX.O> research chief Gregory Glenn told Reuters his company has taken vaccines from discovery to clinical testing in 90 days and believes it could do something similar for the new coronavirus.  \n But to move vaccine candidates from the lab to widespread use in patients involves a number of hurdles, according to health experts and executives for drugmakers working on coronavirus vaccines and treatments.  \n In addition to scaling up manufacturing capacity and building distribution networks, there are regulatory hurdles such as conducting large clinical trials to make sure a vaccine not only confers immunity to the virus but is safe for use in the general population.  \n \"The earliest you could even know if it's going to work is a year,\" Fauci said.  \n Whether even a highly effective vaccine will prove profitable for companies is another big question.  \n \"The outbreak could be abating by the time a vaccine is deemed safe,\" Karen Andersen, who follows biotech companies for Morningstar, said in a research note.  \n The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) has raised around $800 million from donors to aid in preventing pandemic diseases and has allocated some of those funds to biotechs, including Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc <INO.O>, Moderna Inc <MRNA.O> and CureVac, which are working on coronavirus vaccines.  \n \"We stepped into this with no economic expectation,\" said Paul Stoffels, Johnson & Johnson's <JNJ.N> chief scientific officer. \"We'll see whether in the end it gives a reward.\" REUTERS"}, {"content": "League and Players Union create coronavirus pandemic monitoring committee.

For Pereira Coutinho, &quot;it was a correct measure that the Chief Executive took, to close [the casinos] temporarily for 15 days, until further evaluation, [which] makes the Portuguese and local community calm.&quot; The first case of infection of the new coronavirus in Macau has already had a medical discharge, said today to Lusa, a source from the Territory&#39;s Health Services. With this decision, Macau goes from ten to nine confirmed cases. The government of Macau sent thousands of civil servants home, where they continue to work, but at a distance, another solution to combat the dangers of the outbreak that began in a city in central China, Wuhan, capital of Hubei province. Macau closed the casinos and announced the closure of cultural and sporting spaces, as well as all types of businesses, which is practically paralyzing the economy.

The Washington Post identified him as Hong Ling, a 53-year old geneticist who studied rare diseases at Berkeley.

They were eventually allowed to cross.\nEverywhere we went, our presence as journalists attracted attention.\nFriends and family worried about the dangers of the coronavirus and sent us concerned messages as we travelled. But steps to safeguard our own health were relatively straightforward. We took precautions, such as always wearing a mask, carrying hand sanitiser and wearing full protective suits, gloves and goggles in higher risk areas.\nThe more immediate challenge was navigating the questions and restrictions from Chinese officials so that we could get close enough to tell the stories of people affected by the epidemic and the government\u2019s response.\nFor nearly two weeks, we were stopped and questioned at roadsides, train stations and hotels.\nLocals sometimes called the police on us \u2013 obvious foreigners \u2013 when they saw us on the street.

The President of the Republic, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, also considered that universal tests for coronaviruses have the disadvantage of a false sense of security, considering that it has been useful to broaden, but selectively, the performance of these screenings. This Wednesday, Ant\u00f3nio Costa defended that before the issue of the number of tests, or the acquisition of equipment, the Portuguese must now have &quot;enormous discipline&quot; in complying with the rules of hygiene and social distance. Confronted by journalists with criticisms about the reduced number of tests carried out in the country to diagnose the new coronavirus, the prime minister said: &quot;Before the number of ventilators in intensive care, before the number of inpatient beds, before the tests, above we all have to have enormous discipline.&quot; Ricardo Mexia stressed the need to extend the tests to people without an identified agent and regretted that people with clinical characteristics compatible with covid-19 but who did not have &quot;epidemiological criteria&quot; had not been tested. &quot;All people who show symptoms should be tested.

What the association has defended, he pointed out, is that the epidemiological criterion be dispensed with, that health professionals, people with pneumonia and symptoms compatible with covid-19, &quot;even without an epidemiological line&quot;, should be tested. And after samples are taken to the population, from north to south. &quot;We are talking about a thousand tests,&quot; he noted.
