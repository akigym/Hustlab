[{"content": "we are in war. We're all in shock. The case is not for less. No one, especially in the Western world, lived a situation of these. I have already written here many times, which we live in a global world. In this global village that allows us to be quickly connected with Australia or Canada, which allows us to do business with any point in the globe, also returns us as this virus whose spread began in China. Yes, this is also globalization.\nWe are facing an unprecedented crisis because the most recent epidemics remained more geographically concentrated. The 2008 crisis, for example, was neither closely nor by far, similar to this. It was mainly financial, and economical. We had social consequences, but without public health problems we are witnessing and we will have ahead.\nIt is not by chance that at Christmas the most common message is health desire. It is that this good, this gift is, without a doubt, the greatest we can have. Even to meet financial and economic crises. We are at a stage, in which circumstances and risks, almost lead us to say: that the economy is shaped, which shakes the orthodoxy of certain decision-makers. Which one leaves. I think there is no business that is superior to the value of human life. Only we can not sand the economy. We have today to take care of everyone to restore the economy.\nLet's be clear. No one has conditions to face, by themselves, to a pandemic of these. There are no resources. There are no means. Portugal is not an exception. And Portugal had already had, before Covid-19, many problems in our National Health Service (SNS). We are not prepared, not too much or less to test the SNS response peak, fans, machines, do not multiply, much less health professionals, whose shoulders will carry weights that will test their limits, such as China and Italy have already shown us.\nHowever, we are not prepared can not mean crossing arms, waiting for danger. we can not. For exceptional periods, responses must be exceptional. Yes, we need to be home. Yes, we need to realize that this is not for jokes, to go to the beach or simply ignore the severity of the problem of the contagion facility. In life in society, the unconsciousness can, in literal sense, to dare the lives of others, especially those of the most vulnerable.\nTherefore we need strong leadership and authority. We can not play rulers, do not just make a stage pose. We need fiber and pulse people to make difficult, unpopular but necessary decisions. We do not need politiquices. We can not get hostages of seemingly technical opinions, since in these public health measures the technician becomes inseparable from the politician. Italy is a dramatic example. It's there. To observe, learn and correct answers.\nAnd this is also a defining moment. Where is the European Union? What response gives? years and years of European construction, bureaucratic institutions and when we have a global problem, it is each by itself. This is what feels, very little cooperation and solidarity. And this will have economic and political consequences there further. But there we want to be all alive. Also to evaluate the answers that our policy makers gave us, this time will arrive to take the swing, to make the evaluations, but after the fire becomes ashes. Lives to rebuild a world that is all connected and that shows us that there is no one immune in such a situation. rich and poor, western and east. We are all in the same boat, humanity, just like the planet where we inhabit, is one.\nI think there is no greater fear than that of death or to see our perish. And this should be our focus. Then, with health, with all patients treated, we must rebuild a global economy. We still can not count the havocs for two weeks at home, still for more when we do not even know if it's going to be just 15 days or more. It will be dramatic for commerce, restoration, hospitality and other services. Yes. Unfortunately it will be. The tourism sector is of tracks with cancellations. Many factories will have to stop or labor quite below their ability. But we urgently need to static this bug to return to the Esplanadas, restaurants, shopping centers and beaches. Without vaccine, without effective anti-virus in the elimination of Covid-19 remaining, as they called them the epidemiologist Peter Piot (one of the researchers who discovered Ebola), \"medieval methods of containment: insulation, quarantine and mapping of contacts\".\nThat is grown the economy, people's safety is first. it takes courage.

all citizens must also act responsibly and take the outbreak seriously. social media chatter over the past few months since the outbreak has often misled people, as some took it lightly and others panicked to insanity. however, doctors advised none of the above. instead, they asked people to be prepared with some basic but necessary precautions. social distancing, however, is the most important one. three ways that you can help 1) doctors have asked people to stay home if they absolutely do not have to go out. 2) medical experts have also asked people to avoid any kind of large gatherings. 3) take care of hygiene, wash your hands for at least 20 seconds and avoid touching your face these are a few simple \nsteps you can take to support the government in limiting the spread of covid-19. while not much is known about this virus, doctors, have asked people to follow these important steps at the moment to delay the spread of the virus. but even if you test positive, there is no need to suppress your travel history or run away. the quarantine process is not only for the recovery of an infected person but it is also for the safety of other people in the country. going by the rate of spread in italy, iran, and china, any person with symptoms coming in contact with other people could prove deadly as the virus would keep multiplying. even if it does not affect an individual carrying it, doctors have clearly mentioned that its spread could be fatal for older people with a weak immune system. for instance, one of the first cases in uttar pradesh's noida which led to an initial shut down of two schools and a five-star hotel, was from a man who returned from italy and kept his travel history suppressed. he then kept on with his usual social life, exposing others to the danger. there are many other reports in india about suspected people running away in fear that they would be kept in isolation in the quarantine facility. but people have to realise that the process will help in containing the spread of the virus to a great extent. india is still in the initial stages with 110 official confirmed cases, and so far, it has managed to keep the death toll much lower than the other countries in the third week of the outbreak. and, by imposing self-restrictions, individuals can help the government in flattening the curve further. people on social media, especially, the young batch who are yet to grasp the seriousness of the issue, need to be more self vigilant. the basics include - doctor visit for 'flu-like symptoms', avoiding crowded places and social gathering until absolutely necessary, restricting movement, opting for work-from-home. it is important to realise that every country \ninitially had a mere number of cases, but within days it rose massively. desperate times call for desperate measures, and at this hour, more than scrutinising the steps taken by the government, it is imperative to focus on personal hygiene and self-discipline.

'looking for a magic bullet'   dr\u00a0thomas frieden, who was director of the us\u00a0centres for disease control and prevention during the also deadly mers outbreak, said the benefit of antiviral treatments for such emergencies in the past has been modest.   what worked with mers and sars, for example, was better infection control in healthcare facilities, he said of two other types of coronaviruses that also caused global alarm.   \"it doesn't mean we shouldn't try, but we're often looking for a magic bullet and the bright shiny object. sometimes we need to just have the basics,\" frieden said.   a chinese tv report on wednesday said that a research team at zhejiang university had found an effective drug for the virus, while researchers in the uk told sky news separately they had made a \"significant breakthrough\" in finding a vaccine.   reuters could not independently verify the reports, but several traders cited them for sharp upticks in global stock markets.   \"there are no known effective therapeutics against this 2019-ncov,\" said world health organisation spokesman tarik jasarevic, using the current designation for the new coronavirus, when asked about reports of \"drug breakthroughs.\"   health officials in the united states and china have set ambitious goals for getting a vaccine to initial human testing within the next few months.   newer vaccine platforms, such as one developed by moderna inc, allow scientists to create a potential vaccine in record time just based on knowing the genetic code of the novel coronavirus. with the genetic code in hand, scientists can start vaccine development without needing a sample of the virus.   anthony fauci, director of the \nus\u00a0national institutes of allergy and infectious diseases, which is using moderna's platform, said the agency is on the fastest pace ever to develop a vaccine candidate.   he hopes to have a vaccine available for initial safety testing within two and a half to three months from the time scientists determined the genetic sequence of the virus.   novavax inc research chief gregory glenn told reuters his company has taken vaccines from discovery to clinical testing in 90 days and believes it could do something similar for the new coronavirus.   but to move vaccine candidates from the lab to widespread use in patients involves a number of hurdles, according to health experts and executives for drugmakers working on coronavirus vaccines and treatments.   in addition to scaling up manufacturing capacity and building distribution networks, there are regulatory hurdles such as conducting large clinical trials to make sure a vaccine not only confers immunity to the virus but is safe for use in the general population.   \"the earliest you could even know if it's going to work is a year,\" fauci said.   whether even a highly effective vaccine will prove profitable for companies is another big question.   \"the outbreak could be abating by the time a vaccine is deemed safe,\" karen andersen, who follows biotech companies for morningstar, said in a research note.   the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations (cepi) has raised around us$800 million from donors to aid in preventing pandemic diseases and has allocated some of those funds to biotechs, including inovio pharmaceuticals inc, moderna inc and curevac, which are working on coronavirus vaccines.   \"we stepped into this with no economic expectation,\" said paul stoffels, johnson & johnson's chief scientific officer. \"we'll see whether in the end it gives a reward.\"

contain outbreak . growing insecurity over the coronavirus (covid-19) epidemic in china may have a sharp impact on india's already-strained economy as industries fear that the outbreak could cripple their production activities. a recent report by ind-ra said efforts to contain the virus outbreak within next three to four months will be critical as it would determine the fate of many industries around the globe, including in india. if the virus is contained within the aforesaid time period, the impact on businesses in india and elsewhere will not be overgenerous, the report said. but if no positive result comes within a few months, multiple indian sectors could face major supply-side disturbances, triggering a delay in key manufacturing activities. the ind-ra report goes on to highlight that the economic impact could be worse than what was seen during the sars outbreak in 2003. at that time, the world was less dependent on china, now considered the biggest world's biggest manufacturing hub with a substantial contribution to the global gdp. china now contributes to over one-sixth or over 15 per cent of the world's gdp and any deceleration in manufacturing activity could significantly impact worldwide growth. commenting on the situation, sunil damania, cio, marketsmojo.com, said, \"for some reason, if china is unable to control it for six months, the impacts would be severe.\" \"it's very difficult to quantify as there are many moving parts. but it would have a significant impact and has the potential to drag down the world's gdp growth rate by at least 20 basis points for cy2020,\" he added. impact on india the indian economy is already battling many headwinds including inflation, slow demand, and lower-income, which resulted in a sharp fall in gdp growth in 2019. economic woes could amplify as many of the country's key sectors rely heavily on components or parts manufactured in china. while the government predicted \nindia's growth for the next fiscal at 6.5 per cent, delay in supply of key essential commodities from china for a prolonged period could spill water on that optimistic forecast. some sectors such as automobiles, consumer electronics, drugs and pharmaceuticals -- all of which contribute significantly to the country's gdp -- will bear the brunt of the supply curbs. interlinked sectors will also suffer as a result. \"if the outbreak continues for longer than anticipated then the risk will not be restricted to a few sectors, but it can hurt the overall economy,\" damania said. over the past few weeks, concerned voices from the industry have discussed the issue in detail. some industry experts said trade has already been mildly affected in india as supply chain issues start cropping up. the impact will start showing when firms run out of inventory, they said. lower jobs, inflation and more a delay in the supply of inventory would not only lead to lower production but will also lower sales volume. it could also lead to job cuts and higher inflation. for instance, many electronic goods and phone manufacturers have already started facing the effects of supply slowdown as companies in china failed to restart key manufacturing activities. major smartphone sellers like xiaomi hinted at possible rise in prices as supplies of key components are already facing delays. a host of indian smartphone manufacturers, who dearly depend on china for key components, are already indicating that their productions will fall if the supply disruptions continue. it could be a huge blow to india, which is the second-largest smartphone market in the world. some analysts are expecting a drop in production and sales of consumer durables and smartphones while others fear that prices could go up in a situation where there is high demand but lack of supply. consumer durables like television, washing machines and air conditioners -- all of which need critical components manufactured in china -- may also \nsee a drop in sales due to lack of supply. what's worse is the fact that it could lead to higher inflationary pressure on india as china vendors have hiked prices of critical components amid the shortage. higher inflation in times of slow growth could be disastrous for india and could severely disrupt plans to revive the economy. like smartphones, automobile manufacturers also import a host of parts and essential components from china. it may be noted that more than 60 per cent of chinese auto assembly production units have been directly affected by the coronavirus epidemic. a boston consulting group report said the impact on the chinese automobile industry will affect many other countries including india. a fitch report said india's auto production activity could dip by over 8 per cent in 2020 due to the situation. \"china supplies india with between 10-30 per cent of its automotive components and this could be two to three times higher when looking at india's ev segment, which highlights just how exposed india's automobile manufacturing industry is to the slowdown of vehicle chinese component manufacturing,\" it said. but manufacturers in india have little choice apart from monitoring the situation and hoping for factories in china to fire up their assembly lines. some chinese factories reopened this week, but workers are in no position to resume activities with no solution in sight. another concern that india could face due to the virus outbreak in china is job cuts. with lower scope of production activities, some companies will be forced to lay off contractual labourers. this could have a negative effect on india's declining income levels. lower manufacturing and production activity due to the virus outbreak could pull down india's industrial output, which is also not in good shape. to sum it up, a fall in manufacturing output along with ticking inflation and supply constraints could worsen india's growth outlook further. at the time of writing this article, the \ndeath toll from the coronavirus outbreak stood at 1,488 with a sharp jump in the number of confirmed cases at over 65,000. the situation in china remains critical with 121 news deaths on friday

development of a vaccine. singapore: the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) that infected more people in china than the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) outbreak in 2003 has now spread across the globe.   while we are learning more about the virus daily, questions are being raised about its rapid spread. one possibility is that this development could be related to climatic conditions.   climate, weather and flu seasonality   there is reason to believe that the seasonal pattern of novel coronavirus pneumonia may be similar to that of influenza infection and sars, and thus cases may sharply fall by may, when temperatures in china warm up.   in countries with temperate climates such as china and the united states, the flu season usually starts in december with a peak in january or february, after which cases decrease.   sars disappeared in the northern summer of 2003 and has not reappeared significantly since. this seasonality of influenza and other respiratory viruses in temperate countries is thought to be related to factors that affect infectiousness (person to person spread) such as the dryness of the air, ambient air temperature and possibly ultraviolet solar radiation.   human factors may also contribute to the spread of influenza during the colder winters since more time may be spent indoors, presumably in closer contact with other persons.   the 2019-ncov appears to be similar to other respiratory viruses such as influenza or the common cold (rhinovirus), which are spread by large droplets of saliva or phlegm from one person to another (either directly by cough or sneeze) or by contact. that happens when a person touches a contaminated surface and then touches his or her nose, mouth or eyes, inadvertently transmitting the virus.   in fact, studies have shown that these respiratory droplets spread farther when the air is cold and dry.   studies done many years ago showed \nthat the \u201cregular\u201d coronavirus (which is one of the causes of the common cold) can survive on surfaces 30 times longer in places with a temperature of 6 degrees celsius compared to those where the temperature is 20 degrees celsius and humidity levels are high.   more recently, scientists from hong kong university (hku) including professor malik peiris and professor seto wing hong showed that low temperatures and low relative humidity allowed the sars virus to survive much longer than they would in high temperatures and humidity.      the hku team argued that this may be the reason warm and humid southeast asian countries did not have sars outbreaks, unlike hong kong and singapore where in their words, there is \u201cintensive use of air-conditioning\u201d.   thus, just as with influenza, the 2019-ncov may slow down when the sun starts to shine more and the weather warms up in temperate and subtropical countries.   lessons from sars   the sars epidemic occurred 17 years ago and, since then, public health institutions, medical and laboratory science professionals, and the infectious diseases community are much better prepared to respond to novel and emerging infections globally.   the improvements in communications and social media are undeniable. the genetic sequence of this new type of severe pneumonia in wuhan was shared relatively early.   this allowed countries all over the world to develop fast and accurate tests: these were not available during the initial weeks of sars outbreak.   then, we had to depend on clinical examinations and contact tracing to determine who really was infected with sars. near the end of the epidemic, we were able to test everyone and we found out that we had actually missed a significant number of cases \u2013 these were only diagnosed after they had recovered.   this has been the biggest difference in that now, low-resourced countries like nepal and cambodia are able to conduct relatively fast and accurate diagnosis on-site without having to wait for \nsamples to be sent overseas.   given that the genetic information about the novel coronavirus was available even before countries had patients with the virus, many labs in advanced countries, including singapore, are already working on blood tests for rapid detection and studying the immune response to help vaccine development. a trial to test anti-viral treatments has already been initiated in china and is being planned elsewhere.   contact tracing and travel bans   a basic public health approach to any outbreak is the use of contact tracing.      this means that for any patient who is found to be ill, close family members and other persons that he or she had close contact with during the incubation period will be notified that they were exposed to a sick person and quarantined for a further full incubation period, which for this novel infection is indicated to be 14 days.   during the ebola virus outbreak of 2014, this type of contact tracing was done very manually in many settings, although there were a number of mobile applications which were piloted.   for this 2019 virus infection outbreak, much effort is being placed on high-tech contact tracing. it is too early to tell if this will be more effective, but any method to help contacts monitor themselves during the incubation period and detect symptoms may certainly help to decrease community transmission.   public health measures including screening and quarantining are similar to what was done for sars and the middle east respiratory syndrome (mers), although there have been broader approaches to travellers without direct contact with infected patients because of the extent of community spread in china.   given that we are not sure as to what extent asymptomatic persons can transmit the virus, many countries have decided to close their borders to chinese nationals, as they cannot rely on temperature screening to detect who is potentially contagious and necessitating quarantine.   many countries are also \nquarantining their own citizens and permanent residents returning from china, in an effort to limit introduction of this virus into the community.   during sars, the world health organization (who) imposed global travel restrictions and advisories. when a travel restriction is in effect, a country may feel the need to quickly get the ban lifted and reduce its aggressive screening and case finding. this may have contributed to the resurgence of sars in toronto after the initial period of good control.   this time round, different countries have introduced their own travel restrictions which are probably more appropriate to the different situations and their relations with china.   travel bans are always controversial as they tend to have significant unintended consequences and have to be actually instituted before the virus appears in the country. otherwise, they are relatively pointless.   among the concerns about the travel bans instituted this time during the coronavirus is the fact that we do not know how extensive the spread is from people without symptoms.      if this is really very widespread, then a blanket travel ban will have limited effects by now as the virus is probably silently spreading among and through most countries. once there is documented local transmission in a country, as in germany and the united states, the goal has to be containing the local transmission while at the same time preventing re-introduction of the virus.   overall, the key strategy has to be good contact tracing and widespread testing so that every case can be identified, tested and treated. that way the chain of transmission can be broken and the virus stopped in its tracks even before the warm weather kicks in.   vaccines and drug treatments   unfortunately, the current way in which drug and vaccine development in modern medicine happens is very much driven by financial considerations. unlike for example defence or homeland security, the question that always comes up when it \ncomes to treating and preventing human disease is: \u201cis this financially viable?\u201d   as sars disappeared 17 years ago and mers has only occurred sporadically, primarily in the middle east, there has been no incentive for the pharmaceutical industry to invest the funds needed to develop appropriate drugs and vaccines.   all the interest and enthusiasm which came with sars disappeared when the virus did not reappear after a couple of seasons. governments had other priorities and most have actually left this part of national security to private industry.   hence, if and when the novel coronavirus disappears in may and does not reappear next october or november, we can predict that drug and vaccine development will likely die a natural death.   that is unfortunately the way of the world and hopefully something can be done to change this. but that will require a massive global mindset change. given the frequency with which these emerging viral infections occur, the world can ill- afford to continue along this road.   download our app or subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the

month\u2019s lockdown in stricken malaysia where three of every five gloves are made has upended the supply chain and threatens to hamstring hospitals worldwide. the world\u2019s biggest maker of medical gloves by volume, top glove corp bhd (tpgc.kl), has the capacity to make 200 million gloves a day, but a supplier shutdown has left it with only two weeks\u2019 worth of boxes to ship them in, its founder told reuters. we can\u2019t get our gloves to hospitals without cartons, executive chairman lim wee chai said in an interview. hospitals need our gloves. we can\u2019t just supply 50% of their requirement. the virus, which emerged in china at the end of last year, has left malaysia with the highest number of infections in southeast asia at nearly 1,800 cases, with 17 deaths. to halt transmission, the government has ordered people to stay home from march 18 to april 14. glove makers and others eligible for exemption can operate half-staffed provided they meet strict safety conditions. still, the malaysian rubber glove manufacturers association (margma) said it was lobbying almost every hour to return the industry to full strength to minimize risk to the global fight. we\u2019re shut down, said evonna lim, managing director at packaging supplier etheos imprint technology. we fall under an exempted category but still need approval. dr celine gounder, an infectious diseases specialist at the new york university school of medicine, said she was using up to six times as many gloves as normal each day due to the number of patients with covid-19, the illness caused by the virus. if we get to the point where there is a shortage of gloves, that\u2019s going to be a huge problem because then we cannot draw blood safely, we cannot do many medical procedures safely. global call with glove supplies dwindling, the u.s. food and drug \nadministration on its website this month said here some gloves could be used beyond their designated shelf life. on tuesday, the united states lifted a ban on imports from malaysian glove maker wrp asia pacific who it had previously accused of using forced labor. britain\u2019s department of health & social care has urged malaysian authorities to prioritize the production and shipment of gloves that are of utmost criticality for fighting covid-19, showed a letter dated march 20 to glove maker supermax corp (supm.kl) and shared with reuters. margma is considering rationing due to the extremely high demand, its president denis low said. you can produce as many gloves as you can but then there\u2019s nothing to pack them into. under normal circumstances, top glove can meet less than 40% of its own packaging needs. for the remainder, it said just 23% of suppliers have gained approval to operate at half strength. we are lobbying almost every hour, we are putting in a lot of letters to the ministry, said low. we are lobbying hard for the chemical suppliers and we want to ensure that the printers are also being given approval and any other supporting services, even transportation. malaysia\u2019s ministry of international trade and industry on tuesday said it had received masses of applications to operate through the lockdown, and that it was seeking cooperation from industries to give way to those producing essential goods. automation developed economies are home to only a fifth of the world\u2019s population yet account for nearly 70% medical glove demand due to stringent medical standards. at 150, u.s. glove consumption per-capita is 20 times that of china, latest margma data showed. margma expects demand to jump 16% to 345 billion gloves this year, with malaysia\u2019s market share rising two percentage points to 65%. thailand usually follows at about 18% and china at 9%. top glove said orders have doubled since february and it sees sales rising by a fifth in the next six months. its stock, \nwith a market value of about $3.5 billion, has risen by a third this year versus a fall of 16% in the wider market. the company, with customers in 195 economies, registered the highest net money inflow last week among listed malaysian firms, along with peer hartalega holdings bhd (hthb.kl), showed midf research data. other glove makers include kossan rubber industries bhd (krib.kl) and careplus group bhd (care.kl). we are fortunate enough to be in essential goods, said lim. these few months and at least the next six months will be an all-time high in terms of sales volume, revenue and profit. with more than 80% of its 44 factories worldwide automated, top glove itself is less impacted by the lockdown than its more labor-intensive domestic suppliers. packaging woes aside, however, ramping up production could turn under-supply into over-supply when the coronavirus outbreak finally subsides. this outbreak will create awareness and make humankind healthier, said lim. people will pay more attention, they will invest more, they will buy more so demand will be more.

she sought care at a traditional medicine hospital in daegu after a minor car accident, where a medical worker who treated her later tested positive for the virus. while running a fever, she went to a buffet at a hotel and the church services. shincheonji is in the biggest crisis in its 36-year history, as hundreds of members have tested positive for the virus, sars-cov-2. all of its 210,000 known

outbreak, but that five or six other members of the church were infected together with patient 31. the church had a presence in wuhan, the center of the virus in china, according to the kcdc, though it is unclear whether that played a role. also known as the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony, the church was founded and is headed by self-proclaimed messiah lee man-hee. \u201cthis disease case is the devil\u2019s deed to stop the rapid growth of shincheonji,\u201d lee said in a message on friday on an internal app used by members. but its secretive practices and often-aggressive

runs a counseling center in seoul for former members of shincheonji. south koreans vented anger after an official at a daegu public health center that carries out virus tests continued to work even after he was told to get tested. he revealed he was a member of the daegu shincheonji church only after the test showed he was infected, daegu officials said. but health officials and experts cautioned the blame should not be focused on the church and its believers, saying they were also victims. kcdc is also looking into links between the church and a hospital in nearby cheongdo county, which reported the second-highest number of patients in the country with more than 110. the county is a holy site for shincheonji believers as the birthplace of lee, and recently a funeral for his older brother was held at that hospital. on a recent visit, the daegu church was shuttered and silent, surrounded by empty streets and closed stores. someone had thrown eggs at the front gate of the

Meanwhile thousands of people are infected hundreds died, long since several countries have reported cases. because the pathogen only last year was unknown, and the consequences of the eruption are not yet foreseeable, that's need-to know large: google trends recorded for January a rapidly growing search pay for coronavirus. a demand that does not remain uncovered: on twitter have been weeks in the past four more than 15 million tweets for coronavirus discontinued in the media every day, new news and assessments. there are so many contributions that who writes from a infodemie, an abundance of information - correct, but also wrong. one must generally between unsecured information, different from the context cracked or false news and conspiracy theories. so circulating on the net about the story about a couple of parents that supposedly her two sick children has been left at the airport. evidence does not exist for it. spread equally in a video, the alleged in alarmistischem ton facts about the virus. the allegations therein were partly exaggerated, partly unoccupied and partly false, as \nThe portal corrected has researched. But there are also conspiracy theories. So it says, the outbreak is on a complip of the Microsoft founder Bill Gates. That's not true. Now you may find this information even harmless. Part, however, are the wrong information spreading around the new coronavirus, harmful, even life-threatening. Approximately when they provide alleged remedies or treatments. Thus, the Indian Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy advises the homeopathic treatment of coronavirus pulmonary disease. The effect of homeopathy is not detected beyond the placebo effect beyond. And on Facebook, the rumor is that it is a coronavirus infection courier to drink a chemical solution called MMS. This is not only wrong, but when used even life-threatening. Facebook, usually unknown for its intensive confrontation with false content, has now announced to remove appropriate posts from its platform. Twitter does not just want to delete misleading contributions, but only view credible information in the search for the coronavirus, it is in a blog post. The media dynamics that you can watch at the moment is not new. It resembles the other newslays - whether terrorist attack or plane crash: initially something bad happens, then in the social media information in minutes, finally reports media. People read posts or articles, looking for more information, according to certainty. But because there is still little secure knowledge, there is room for rumors, false information and even conspiracy theories. The effect is strengthened by the fact that the level of knowledge about the center of the news situation - in this case the coronavirus disease - can constantly change and what seems certainly seems today could already be refuted tomorrow. Nicole Kr\u00e4mer works as a professor for \nSocial Psychology at the University of Duisburg-Essen and researches among other things to fake news. She sees several reasons for the dissemination of false and unsecured information: \"Much of the coronavirus is still unclear,\" she says, \"This ensures insecurity.\" And because the outbreak to the pandemic threatens to be threatened and thus everyone and everyone in Germany could sometime danger to be tackled, the information needs are particularly large. People send information they see too fast, says Kr\u00e4mer - often without having read the news. Images with particularly frightening motifs, such as recordings from crowded hospital corridors where patients lie on the ground, fueled that: \"Some texts are certainly redirected because the power of the pictures is so strong,\" says Kr\u00e4mer. For the dissemination of wrong information, we are all responsible. \"It is less relevant who puts a false news in the world, but who spreads them. And these are mostly people, no bots,\" says Kr\u00e4mer. But of course false information is not only unknowingly scattered. There are also players who serve the information specifically, says Kr\u00e4mer. That could be layman who just want attention, but also state actors who want to pie restlessness. In addition, there is a lot to familiar to the experience of others, said the communication scientist Markus Sch\u00e4fer from the University of Mainz to ZDF. Together with colleagues, he examined how internet users inform about health. Accordingly, almost every second respondent (46 percent) indicates to inform oneself about health issues in personal talks with family, friends and colleagues. 39 percent use the Internet, in the age group of 18 to 29, it was even 46 percent (journal for online consulting and computer-mediated communication: Sch\u00e4fer et al., \n2019). Only health topics are often very complex. \"That's why false information spreads so well in this area,\" says Sch\u00e4fer. The medicine is not exact science. Scientific findings and experience together flow together in medical practices. There is sometimes more space for rumors than scientific questions. The effect of such false information is not only problematic in the short term, but also long-term. In psychology, one speaks of the wrong information effect: If one reads directly after an event incorrect information, this can lead to it that you realize that - even if you actually need to know that you do not agree (for example, Loftus, 2005). \"Evolutionary psychological is normal,\" says Social Psychologist Kr\u00e4mer. We first believed what we see and did not doubt everything immediately. The problem is that false information would be exactly possible as facts. The wrong information could only be overwritten. Even if people have read a correction, it could therefore happen that they notice the wrong information. It gets even more difficult if the wrong information that reads you fits into your own worldview. Because we all tend to believe that we want to believe. In psychology, the Confirmation Bias is called. In the case of the coronavirus, this is good to watch: who wants to believe that the world is in the middle of a pandemic, will find information and share that match. Who wants to believe the pathogen is harmless, finds contrary information. It is currently unclear how fatally the virus really is - and whether the outbreak will take global proportions. So how can you make sure that what you read is really true? \"Who sees online a text, should not just share him, but read all the way,\" says Social Psychologist Kr\u00e4mer. It also helps to pay attention to the sources. a contribution is based on \nScientific findings? Can this be checked what is there? Does anyone just quotes from other media? What is the original source? Is there any one? That may sound banal, but can effectively help identify false information. Therefore, media are therefore responsible for correcting reports if they originally contained incorrect information, so crawers. Experts and experts are already looking for a global media strategy for future disease breaks. \"We need effective media observers who monitor, as reported on disease breaks,\" says Ilona Kickbusch, Professor of Global Health in Geneva, and Gabriel Leung, Dean for Medicine at the University of Hong Kong, in a post for the sheet British Medical Journal. In the future, the Who should not only contact social media, but also work together with well-known facts. So you can also find out whether information would hold back or silenced critical journalists and journalists. At the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities of the World Health Organization WHO reported an accumulation of pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause in the Central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the diseases. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days then a group released a group of the virologen Christian's premier from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 the first diagnostic test for the new virus, the researcher provisionally call 2019-NCOV. With the test, the virus can be detected in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, on which, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected. Both the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Mers (Middle \nEast respiratory syndromes) are caused by coronaviruses which have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more than 750 died. With the MERS virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronaviruses. Many of them relate to respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example. In China, several thousand persons are suffering from them, some of them - most of them with pre-existing conditions - have died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first infection cases outside of China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been in Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection with a tourist, who came back from Wuhan, on January 24, the first cases were known in France. Meanwhile, first cases were confirmed in Germany. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. The virus can cause pneumonia that can endally end. Since it is a viral illness, antibiotics do not help. Meanwhile, it is clear that the virus can be transferred from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transfers after a dozen cases were known in medical staff. Medizors assume that the virus is transmitted above all over droplet infection. The World Health Organization calculates, as announced on January 24, at the moment that an infected one cuts 1.4 to 2.5 other people. Contest these numbers, the virus is less contagious than SARS and also the viral flu. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: You should often wash your hands and close contact \nto avoid people with respiratory diseases and wild animals. That can not be said yet. The World Health Organization said on 28 January that about one-fifth of the reported cases through the virus will be seriously ill, so in case of doubt must be treated intensive care. According to reports, the first death pots were patients who had some severe pre-existing conditions. Even with other infectious diseases, people with pre-existing diseases are particularly endangered - for example at the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so change their genome. This can cause you to become more dangerous for people in the course of an outbreak - but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) expects no similar mortality to the current time as the outbreak of SARS. More about the outbreak of the new coronavirus read here.

The director of the Sanitary Alerts Coordination and Emergencies has been surprised with the declaration of the \nState of emergency in Italy. \"It is not the EU consensus and in Spain at the moment it does not arise,\" she said. With the preliminary data, \"the signs are that the disease is not excessively transmissible. It is only transmitted in a community way in an area and it seems that the epidemic has possibilities to start remitting soon,\" she said. The transmission area is only Hubei, the province of China where Wuhan is located. \"There are Chinese provinces with fewer cases than other countries. It would be inconsistent to recommend not traveling to the whole country,\" she said. Simon explained that three doctors and a nurse will accompany Spaniards evacuated from Wuhan on their flight, which took off this morning of the Chinese city.

Tang's response had generated a wave of negative comments on Chinese social networks. The admission of it arrived after, at the beginning of the week, the Mayor of Wuhan, Zhou Xianwang, recognized that the municipal government did not disseminate the information available in the first weeks of the crisis. Zhou, however, pointed out that, if she had retained data, it was because she did not receive authorization from higher levels of government to disseminate them.

slightly after sinking as much as 8.9% earlier in the day, also abandoned its 2020 financial forecast and said the cash would be used to deal with a squeeze on capital caused by shutdowns in production due to the fast-spreading virus.  \n the move will give ford more than $37 billion in cash, almost matching the revenue it reported in the fourth quarter. that dwarfs the company's market capitalization of about $18 billion.  \n morgan stanley analyst adam jonas said in a research note that corporate liquidity during the outbreak was \"top of mind\" and that u.s. automakers had strong

"}, {"content": "coronavirus: how the who's global health emergency decision unfolded. the world health organisation (who) is not quick to declare global public health emergencies.   from 2007 through 2019, the united nations agency did so on only five occasions. the rapidly spreading new coronavirus that originated in december in china's wuhan makes a sixth.   the fallout from the organisation's jan 30 call has spread rapidly. four days later, the total number of countries placing border restrictions on chinese travellers has surged to 60. they include australia, india, indonesia, singapore, new zealand, russia and north korea, and many countries have evacuated or are attempting to evacuate their citizens from hubei province at the epidemic's epicentre.   \"our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems\" than china's, who director-general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus said in a tweet. \"i am declaring a public health emergency of international concern\u2026 not because of what is happening in china, but because of what is happening in other countries.\"   the new coronavirus, known as 2019-ncov, can lead to severe and often deadly pneumonia. even as the number of infections and deaths rapidly mounted in hubei's capital wuhan and cases appeared in a growing number of other countries, the who took a deliberate approach to evaluating the danger.   the agency's emergency committee, in meetings on jan 22-23, initially decided not to designate it a global crisis pending collection of more data. a week later, the who declared the coronavirus the first global public health emergency originating in china. such a designation did not apply to even the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) epidemic 17 years ago.   a look at how the organisation reached its decision shows some of the inner workings of the global system for preventing and managing the spread of dangerous new diseases.   the system relies on the rapid sharing of information among \nnational health systems and the global public health organisation. although some chinese officials have drawn criticism internally and abroad for initially trying to downplay the crisis, the who's dr tedros maintains china was quick to share information, enhancing the global response.   \"in many ways, china is setting a new standard for outbreak response,\" dr tedros said at a press conference. \"we would have seen many more cases outside china by now, and probably deaths, if not for the government's efforts.\"   data from china on the pathogen allowed japan, south korea and thailand to diagnose similar cases quickly, he said. for example, a chinese laboratory warned the german government of an infected person returning to germany.   dr tedros, an ethiopian public health expert, arrived on jan 27 in beijing to meet chinese officials. during his visit, president xi jinping called on the country to be transparent in working with the rest of the world and agreed to allow the who to send a group of international experts into the country to study the new strain of coronavirus alongside chinese counterparts.   those data-gathering steps helped fill the information gap that kept the who's emergency panel from issuing its global warning sooner.   before the jan 22-23 meetings, the lack of information on the virulence, infectiousness, severity and clinical symptoms of the coronavirus made reaching a consensus difficult, who emergency committee member john mackenzie told media company caixin.   the global organisation had evidence of transmission of the virus within a household, but that is not unusual for a respiratory disease. the experts were looking for \"third-or fourth-generation infections\", referring to how many times a disease has been passed on, an indication of virulence. that evidence came quickly, laying the groundwork for the emergency committee to issue its global warning.   some argue that compared with the 2003 sars crisis, the chinese government has been much \nmore transparent about the current coronavirus.   \"before we start pointing the finger at china, we need to recognise there are genuine sensitivities around sharing data around new diseases,\" said dr mike ryan, director of the who's health emergencies programme who accompanied dr tedros to beijing. \"i believe in this case the countries that have been affected, including china, have been remarkably transparent.\"   according to us health and human services secretary alex azar, china's compliance with international health regulations and uploading of the genetic sequence of the virus enabled the americans to develop a test kit to screen for infections.   under the who-administered international health regulations, a global public health emergency applies to \"an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response\".   since 2007, the who has declared public health emergencies in response to the 2009 h1n1 influenza pandemic, the 2014 setbacks in global polio eradication efforts, the 2014 west africa ebola epidemic, the 2016 zika virus outbreak and the 2018-2019 kivu ebola epidemic.   the organisation's emergency committee, which makes the call, is made up of epidemiologists, virologists and infectious disease experts. among them, at least one expert comes from the country where the epidemic began.   the panel can also make recommendations to foreign governments on measures such as travel or trade restrictions.   even during serious crises, the who is conservative in its pronouncements. through july last year, the kivu ebola epidemic killed 1,500 and infected more than 2,300 after appearing in the democratic republic of congo in august 2018 and spread to nearby countries. the disease was not declared an international public health emergency until the who's fourth emergency committee meeting last july.   three factors weighed on \nthe current who decision, according to professor didier houssin, chairman of the who emergency committee. they were the rising number of cases in china, the growing number of countries with confirmed infections and the spread of questionable measures by some nations involving travellers.   while the emergency committee does not encourage travel or trade restrictions, it acknowledges that such steps can be useful at times, such as when response capabilities are limited or when there is a large likelihood of infection among vulnerable groups.   under the international health regulations, countries are required to report travel restrictions to the who, and they are barred from taking steps that encourage discrimination.   after news broke of the coronavirus that originated in wuhan, many countries imposed increasingly stringent measures. in addition to posting travel warnings and tightening border controls, several counties implemented preliminary screening measures using their own public health organisations to diagnose those who may have come into contact with the virus even before they showed symptoms.   the united states reacted especially quickly. on jan 17, four days after thailand reported its first case, the centres for disease control and prevention (cdc) said it would screen passengers arriving from wuhan at major airports in new york, los angeles and san francisco. at the time, the us had not reported any cases of the disease. after it did so, the country expanded screenings of chinese passengers to 20 airports while also advising against all travel to china.   last friday, the us declared the coronavirus epidemic a public health emergency and temporarily closed its borders to foreign nationals who had travelled to china in the previous two weeks and are not immediate family members of us citizens or permanent residents. the government also imposed mandatory two-week quarantines for those who were in china's hubei province during that time span.   as she \nconfirmed europe's first case of the coronavirus on jan 24, french health minister agnes buzyn promised total transparency and daily updates to combat misinformation. she said sharing epidemic information with the public was the best barrier to its spread.   even though china shared the virus' genome sequence on jan 11, researchers do not yet have a full grasp of its characteristics and routes of transmission, according to the who.   because developing a vaccine or treatment requires significant time and resources, all countries - including china and the us - should pool their efforts, said dr richard hatchett, chief executive of the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations (cepi), an international epidemiology group.   cepi, made up of public and private entities, said on jan 23 that it was funding research into three separate efforts to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus with the aim of shortening development time to several months.   the us national institutes of health started research on vaccines after receiving the virus' genetic sequencing, dr anthony fauci, director of the us national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, told cnn on jan 20. he cautioned that the development process can last months or years, so controlling the epidemic will require \"traditional\" public health measures.   so long as there is no vaccine, the only available measures for slowing the spread of the disease are quarantine, delaying resumption of work and schools and restricting travel, dr hatchett said last month at the world economic forum in davos, switzerland. he cautioned that the cost of these measures is high and difficult to sustain.   from studying non-medical interventions in the 1980s, the us found that disease prevention is more effective when a city implements various interventions during the onset of an outbreak, dr hatchett said.   as a us government public health official in 2005, dr hatchet helped draft the country's epidemic response plan in the \nlight of the outbreak of the h5n1 influenza. \u2022 xu heqian, wu

'not feeling too good'    a flower child of the 1960's, dreyfuss lived a life characterized by art and activism. after marrying her high school sweetheart and giving birth to their son, she pursued a degree in women's studies at cal state long beach, where she marched for women's equality and abortion rights.    furious over president gerald ford's pardoning of former president richard nixon in 1974, dreyfuss took to her typewriter and penned an angry letter to ford. \"today is my son's 9th birthday,\" she wrote of a young briggs. \"i do not feel like celebrating.\"    by the time she arrived at the life care center in may 2019, years of health issues had dimmed some of that spark, her son said. fibromyalgia and plantar fasciitis restricted her to a walker or a wheelchair, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease required her to have a constant flow of oxygen.    when her son visited on feb. 25, he brought a grocery bag of her favourites, including diet a&w root beer. she awoke from a nap and smiled at him, but hinted at her discomfort.    \"hi doug,\" she said. \"i'm not feeling too good.\"    still, dreyfuss talked about an upcoming visit with her sisters - the movies she wanted to see, the restaurants she wanted to try. the mother and son then had only a vague awareness of the deadly virus then ravaging china.    in hindsight, \nbriggs realized he had witnessed the first signs of her distress. his mother was using more oxygen than usual, her breathing was more strained.    at the time, staff at the nursing home believed they were handling a flu outbreak and were unaware the coronavirus had started to take hold, a spokesman has said.

far away, in china - with what was happening in his mother's hospital room.    in the bay area, meri and hillary dreyfuss were packing their suitcases on feb. 28 when \nbriggs telephoned. after the call, they decided that visiting their sister would pose too much danger of infection.    \"i realized there was no way we were going to get on a plane at that point, because we couldn't see her,\" said the middle sister, hillary. \"and now, it seemed that we shouldn't be seeing doug, either.\"    they cancelled their flights. on saturday, feb. 29, briggs learned his mother's condition was deteriorating. tough decisions loomed. briggs and his aunts decided to prioritise making her comfortable over keeping her alive. doctors gave her morphine to relax the heaviness in her lungs.    she died the next day.    having emerged from a two-week quarantine, briggs will soon retrieve his mother's cremated remains. the family has been struggling with how to memorialize her life in such chaotic times.    \"all the things that one would want to happen in the normal mourning process have been subsumed by this larger crisis,\" said hillary dreyfuss. \"it's almost as though her death has become a tiny footnote in what's going on.\" reuters "}, {"content": "coronavirus deaths eclipse global toll from sars, but 'fewer unknowns' now about the virus. london (bloomberg) - the coronavirus disease spreading around the world has killed more than 810 people, exceeding the toll from the global outbreak of sars that started in china almost two decades ago. \n less than two months after surfacing in late december in wuhan, china, cases of the coronavirus have topped 37,000. the fast-spreading disease long ago eclipsed the 8,100 total cases of sars, which was transmitted worldwide in eight months, disrupting travel, industry and health care, and killing 774 people before coming under control. \n both severe acute respiratory syndrome, or sars, and the coronavirus are members of a larger family known to cause disease ranging from common colds to lethal infections. while both emerged from china before spreading to multiple countries, their paths have diverged in a number of significant ways. \n the rate of deaths among people infected with sars was close to 10 per cent, said david heymann, who oversaw the world health organization's (who) response to the outbreak, while it appears that rate in coronavirus will be below 2 per cent. an analysis of about 17,000 coronavirus patients showed that 82 per cent had mild cases, who officials said in a press briefing. \n \"you have to compare the two in perspective,\" heymann said in an interview. the coronavirus outbreak \"could look more dramatic than it is.\" \n the number of cases and deaths from the new coronavirus may be far higher. the health system in wuhan has been overwhelmed by the disease, with limited ability to care for every patient or diagnose new cases. other cases may have been too mild to be counted by chinese officials. \n \"i'm taking them for their word, but i really can't guarantee that they're reporting the right number. the only way you can guarantee it is if you go there and you monitor them,\" said anthony s. fauci, head of the us national institute of health's national institute of allergy and infectious diseases. us officials have been trying to get a team into china to better study the outbreak. \n the epidemic of sars began in 2002 with a report of mysterious pneumonia in southern china's province of guangdong. it shifted into a higher gear when it was amplified in hospitals and then, carried by international travellers, spread to 26 countries. \n hospital workers were at particularly high risk, as so-called super-spreading events sickened multiple doctors and nurses. the outbreak was finally controlled by july 2003 with improved infection-control procedures and the who's recommendations to limit travel to areas where the outbreak was still out of control. \n while sars infected and killed hundreds of people outside china, the newer virus, known as 2019-ncov, has been mostly confined to the mainland, with all but two of the known fatalities there. even as china has been lauded for its quick action and open communication regarding the outbreak, a number of unknowns continue to heighten concern about the disease. \n \"when you don't know your enemy, the fear of your enemy grows,\" said michael ryan, executive director of who's emergencies programme, said on friday at a press conference. \n researchers still don't know exactly how the virus is spread. all signs point to droplet transmission, which means that small bits of fluid from the mouth and nose that carry the disease move from one person to the next, usually in face-to-face encounters. \n there's some evidence that people who aren't experiencing symptoms - coughing, sneezing, muscle pain - can also spread the virus. that means airport screeners, as well as patients themselves, stand little chance of finding infected people. some researchers also think the disease might be spread through contaminated faeces, which was also the case with sars and presents other prevention challenges. \n the severity of the coronavirus outbreak led to a lockdown of wuhan city and hubei province - with more than 58 million people - along with some other areas of china. the nation has become a virtual island as an increasing number of governments and airlines impose restrictions on travel from the mainland. \n the who hasn't recommended travel limits related to the coronavirus, but countries are desperately trying to keep the illness from their shores. research on the new virus is moving quickly, and more may be known soon about how the disease spreads and how to stop it, heymann said. \"there are already fewer and fewer unknowns,\" he said.

contain the virus shut down much of the world's second-largest economy, an official survey showed. the survey, coming as global stock markets fall sharply on fears that the virus will spread abroad,

of 1.4%, substantially lower than earlier studies that focused on patients in wuhan, where it started and has been most severe. assuming there are many more cases with no or very mild symptoms, \"the case fatality rate may be considerably less than 1%,\" u.s. health officials wrote in an editorial in the journal. that would make the new virus more like a severe seasonal flu than a disease similar to its genetic cousins sars, severe acute respiratory syndrome, or mers, middle east respiratory syndrome. despite anxieties about a wider outbreak in the u.s., trump has defended measures taken and lashed out at democrats who have questioned his handling of the threat. at a political rally friday night in north charleston, south carolina, trump asserted that democratic complaints about his handling of the virus threat are \"their new hoax,\" echoing similar past complaints by the president about the russia investigation and his impeachment. trump accused democrats of \"politicizing\" the coronavirus threat and boasted about preventive steps he's ordered in an attempt to keep the virus from spreading across the united states. shortly before trump began to speak, health officials confirmed a second case of the virus in the u.s. in a person who \ndidn't travel internationally or have close contact with anyone who had the virus. the outbreak's spread around the globe has led to shuttered holy sites, canceled classes and changes to the daily lives of millions. italian authorities say the country now has more than 1,000 coronavirus cases. the head of italy's civil protection agency told a press conference that the total number reached 1,128 saturday. officials also reported eight more deaths of people with the virus, bring italy's total to 29. iran is preparing for the possibility of \"tens of thousands\" of people getting tested for the virus as the number of confirmed cases spiked again saturday, an official said, underscoring the fear both at home and abroad over the outbreak in the islamic republic. the virus and the covid-19 illness it causes have killed 43 people out of 593 confirmed cases in iran, health ministry spokesman kianoush jahanpour said. the new toll represents a jump of 205 cases - a 150% increase from the 388 reported the day before. earlier saturday, bahrain barred public gatherings for two weeks and threatened legal prosecution against travelers who came from iran and hadn't been tested for the virus. saudi arabia has closed off islam's holiest sites in mecca and medina to foreign pilgrims, disrupting travel for thousands of muslims already headed to the kingdom and potentially affecting plans later this year for millions more ahead of the fasting month of ramadan and the annual hajj pilgrimage. even in isolated, sanctions-hit north korea, leader kim jong un called for stronger anti-virus efforts to guard against covid-19, saying there will be \"serious consequences\" if the illness spreads to the country. china has seen a slowdown in new infections and on saturday morning reported 427 new cases over the past 24 hours along with 47 additional deaths. the city at the epicenter of the outbreak, wuhan, accounted for the bulk of both. the ruling party is striving to restore public and business \nconfidence and avert a deeper economic downturn and politically risky job losses after weeks of disruptions due to the viral outbreak. south korea, the second hardest hit country, reported 813 new cases saturday - the highest daily jump since confirming its first patient in late january and raising its total to 3,150. streets were deserted in the city of sapporo on japan's northernmost main island of hokkaido, where a state of emergency was issued until mid-march. seventy cases - the largest from a single prefecture in japan - have been detected in the island prefecture. in france, the archbishop of paris advised parish priests not to administer communion by placing the sacramental bread in the mouths of worshippers. instead, priests were told to place the bread in their hands. according to the paris diocese, a priest tested positive for the virus friday after returning from italy. the head of the world health organization on friday announced that the risk of the virus spreading worldwide was \"very high,\" while un secretary-general antonio guterres said the \"window of opportunity\" for containing the virus was narrowing. in asia, tokyo disneyland and universal studios japan announced they would close, and events that were expected to attract tens of thousands of people were called off, including a concert series by the k-pop group bts. tourist arrivals in thailand are down 50% compared with a year ago, and in italy - which has the most reported cases of any country outside of asia - hotel bookings are falling and premier giuseppe conte raised the specter of recession. economists have forecast global growth will slip to 2.4% this year, the slowest since the great recession in 2009, and down from earlier expectations closer to 3%. for the united states, estimates are falling to as low as 1.7% growth this year, down from 2.3% in 2019.

The ruler explained that the closure of borders is a difficult decision because it is necessary to evaluate the impact on the supply of food to the territory and because it adds constraints to the daily routine of many Macao residents and many territory workers living in China. \"We are not closing no boundary, they will not run to buy food. We have stock enough, do not worry, \"he assured him.

transmission with the number of novel coronavirus cases climbing steadily and reports of local transmission emerging from across the country, india is on the brink of community transmission, or stage 3, of covid-19. on march 24, while announcing a three-week preventive lockdown of the entire country, prime minister narendra modi allocated rs 15,000 crore to boost the health infrastructure. the funds will be used to create additional hospital beds, build on the stockpile of covid-19 testing kits and train medical practitioners. the centre is putting in place protocols, including the acquisition of medical equipment and protection gear needed in the special isolation wards and facilities. a training protocol for frontline health workers is also being prepared. the funds announced are a beginning. we would need more, depending on how soon we can end this affliction. earlier, states were only using national health mission (nhm) funds. now, they have access to a central fund, says dr v.k. paul, public health expert and a member of niti aayog. the first thing to do with the funds is equip hospitals, with personal protective gear, ventilators, additional oxygen, drugs and train staff. while isolation wards are being created, dr paul says covid-specific facilities also need to be looked at for stage 3. in geneva, they are out of icu (intensive care unit) beds. such is the virulence of the disease at its peak. we need good hospitals that is where the focus is now. to support hospitals, we must also have isolation facilities, a strict surveillance system and should even consider setting up call centres in medical colleges, he says. dr paul maintains that india is still at stage 2 (local transmission), but testing is being done more widely now. kerala, which has both an enduring healthcare system and a strong network of panchayati raj bodies, is stealing a march on other states with its preparedness. chief minister pinarayi \nvijayan says since a high number of people might need to be put under quarantine, local bodies have been instructed to identify hospitals, buildings, schools and auditoriums for the purpose. even a minor lapse can prove disastrous, vijayan cautioned office-bearers of local bodies during a video conference on march 19. if there is a spurt in cases, the existing facilities would not be enough to meet the requirements. since the vast majority under observation would be home-quarantinedas people under special care\u2019, kerala\u2019s strategy is to get the local bodies to take responsibility for local communities and ensure they do not face logistical problems while handling the situation. 2 dedicated covid-19 hospitals and icus with a hospital bed to population ratio of just 1:1,000 or around a million hospital beds in all, less than 100,000 icu beds and only 40,000 ventilators at hand, india\u2019s healthcare infrastructure is ill-equipped to face a sharp increase in covid-19 cases. ventilators will be particularly critical. the indian council of medical research (icmr), in a report, said that about 5 per cent of covid-19 patients may require intensive care, and half of those may need ventilator support. covid-19 impacts the lungs. in severe cases, the lungs fill up with fluid and it becomes hard to breathe. a ventilator ensures that the lungs do not collapse while the treatment is on, says dr j.v. divatia of the department of anaesthesiology, critical care and pain at mumbai\u2019s tata memorial hospital. he warns of trouble if the patient numbers in india match those in china or europe. there is no guideline on how many ventilators a hospital needs. in india, we keep about 20 per cent of beds for critical care, which is about enough in normal conditions, says dr divatia. most high-end ventilators available in india are imported and cost rs 5-12 lakh each. hospitals say the quality of equipment made in the country isn\u2019t as reliable. if orders are placed in advance, more ventilators can \nbe bought and set up within a week. with little demand for their products at home, indian manufacturers have been exporting ventilators. ventilators manufactured by the delhi-based croyox medical service, costing rs 4 lakh each, have been exported to nepal, thailand and europe previously. things changed on march 19 with the government\u2019s ban on export of ventilators. it wants 100,000 simpler\u2019 ventilators, customised for covid-19 patients, installed across the country by april 30. mysuru-based skanray technologies is being tasked to make 5,000 of these. low-end ventilators could be an alternative if the covid-19 symptoms are not very severe, says dr divatia. ventilator parts such as valves and sensors, though, are expected to remain in short supply. we will share the knowhow with others ready to make these customised ventilators so that the demand can be met as soon as possible, says vishwaprasad alva, managing director, skanray technologies. experts also underscore the need to ensure adequate oxygen supplies in hospitals; many hospitals in europe struggled to save covid-19 patients as oxygen supplies ran out. across states, properties are being identified to transform them into dedicated covid-19 hospitals. these could be defunct or upcoming hospitals or even hostels of educational institutions that can be converted into 250-300-bed facilities. the first such facility is a 100-bed centre set up by the sir h.n. reliance foundation hospital, mumbai, at the 700-bed sevenhills hospital in andheri. anand mahindra, chairman of the mahindra group, has pledged his club mahindra resorts to serve as care centres for covid-19 patients. he also said the group\u2019s manufacturing units will see if they can manufacture ventilators. hyderabad\u2019s owaisi hospital and research centre is setting up an exclusive 100-bed centre. the all india institute of medical sciences (aiims), new delhi, which has about 1,300 doctors and 1,800 nurses on its rolls, has set up an isolation ward for covid-19 \ncases. the institute has also freed up some 150 beds at its facilities in jhajjar, haryana. regular meetings are being held to assess the situation and, on march 23, aiims suspended opd (out-patient department) services as a precautionary measure. plans for more isolation wards are being fine-tuned and will be reviewed by the icmr in terms of protocol. this is among the steps being taken just in case the need arises, says dr indu bhushan, ceo, national health authority (nha). we are preparing ourselves should there be a [community-level] spread. that includes ensuring that private sector facilities support the treatment of covid-19 cases. the nha is assessing the capacity and readiness of private hospitals on this. 3 stimulus for domestic pharma the abrupt stoppage in the flow of active pharmaceutical ingredients (apis), mostly from china, is impacting the indian pharmaceutical sector, with fears now of a potential shortage of bulk drugs and intermediates. a corpus fund to incentivise indian pharma companies is one way to encourage domestic production of apis. the central department of pharmaceuticals has asked the union ministry for environment, forest and climate change to waive the environmental impact assessment reports for projects by some categories of pharma firms. this, it is felt, will help reduce the time required to manufacture bulk drugs and apis locally. the centre has also pledged rs 10,000 crore towards the production of critical drugs and another rs 4,000 crore to promote manufacturing of medical equipment in the country. the icmr\u2019s announcement on march 23 that the antimalarial hydroxychloroquine could be used as a preventive drug by covid-19 high-risk groups (health workers or household members of patients) has led to a scramble, with chemists reporting that stocks are running out. in mumbai, most shops are out of stock. doctors have been trying a combination of drugs, which worked for other infections, to treat covid-19 symptoms. if this drug is \nproven to work, we would have a need for it, says dr c.s. pramesh, director, tata memorial hospital, mumbai. following us president donald trump\u2019s endorsement of hydroxychloroquine, indian pharma companies ipca and zydus cadila received bulk orders of the drug from the us. even though india has a strong foothold in the production of hydroxychloroquine and pharma experts say production can be ramped up any time, there is already a noticeable shortage because of hoarding. while the government is planning to stockpile about 2 million doses of hydroxychloroquine, ensuring smooth supplies will also require a ban on its export, like the uk has done, as well as on over-the-counter sale. 4 reliable testing kits as of 10 am, march 25, india had tested 22,928 samples for covid-19, according to icmr. this includes more than 500 random sample tests. the governing body for testing in india had come under fire for limiting the testing criteria in the initial days of the outbreak to those who had travelled to countries affected by the virus or had come in close contact with a covid-19 patient. while about 300,000 test kits were available, only about 9,000 samples had been tested in the first week of march. without data, it is hard to gauge the extent of the spread or make projections on the course the disease will take. testing can slow down the disease, says k. sujatha rao, former union health secretary. on march 20, icmr expanded the testing criteria to include even those who showed flu-like symptoms but had not travelled to countries reporting an outbreak of the disease. two days later, it was announced that private labs would be granted licences for testing and orders would be placed with indian companies to produce covid-19 test kits. private labs, however, say it is too early to comment on whether they can start testing since quality-compliant kits are not freely available. also, the countrywide lockdown has crippled public transport, affecting staff strength in the labs. dr \nnavin dang, founder of dr dang\u2019s labs (one of the private facilities approved for testing), favours widespread testing. a few kits might be lost, but lives are also saved, he says. an ideal situation would be one like south korea where mass testing is possible, where anyone with symptoms can be tested and isolated if needed. dr dang, however, discourages home tests. self-assessment is not advisable as it is not reliable. the covid-19 test has highly specific guidelines, nose and throat swabs are collected in protective packing and tested in labs with a biosafety level of 2 and above and a real-time pcr (polymerase chain reaction) system. trained personnel are needed for it, he says. the centre has capped the pricing of the test at rs 4,500 and urged private labs to conduct the test free of cost, if possible. it has also mandated that only us food and drug administration and european ce certified test kits be used. pune-based mylab discovery solutions, the first home company to get commercial approval for manufacturing the test kits, has produced indigenous kits that give results faster (in 2.5 hours as opposed to the standard 7 hours) and are cheaper (the company wants to price it around rs 1,500). while icmr has ordered about 200,000 kits from germany, mylab claims it can produce that many in a week. its test kits, though, are yet to acquire international certifications. for me, quality is everything and i will not start testing till the time i am able to procure high-quality test kits. we cannot afford misdiagnosis at this stage, says dr dang. 5. lessons from home-quarantine from a covid-19 positive man in telangana, who hosted 1,000 guests at his wedding, to a london-returnee in kolkata who repeatedly evaded testing, to the wife of a covid-19 patient who escaped from quarantine and boarded a train to agra, india\u2019s fight against coronavirus is being thwarted by cases of individuals fleeing isolation. who says covid-19 cannot affect young people? it can. there have \nbeen severe symptoms in the youth too. fewer, but it cannot be ruled out, says dr naresh trehan, chairman and managing director, medanta hospital, gurugram. those who are old or immunocompromised are high-risk. recovery is also slower for them. the lungs get damaged a bit in severe cases, and this can impact long-term cardiovascular health, though we don\u2019t know exactly how yet. dr trehan says that covid-19 being a new disease, it is hard to predict who will get sick and in what manner. those breaking quarantine because they feel they are going to get only mild symptoms and will be fine are wrong. they are putting everyone at risk. while states like maharashtra are hand-stamping quarantined patients, to allow easy detection in case they step out in public, kerala has adopted a home-quarantine model that relies more on community support than coercive measures. it is very difficult to convince people to stay at home for two weeks. we had been constantly contemplating how people could be dissuaded from breaking the rules of quarantine without having to punish\u2019 them, says dr amar fettle, nodal officer for public health emergencies in kerala\u2019s health department. the state has close to 53,000 people under home quarantine. dr fettle credits this to community outreach. we have 30,000 accredited social health activists and 15,000 field workers, who visit homes and educate people on the importance of isolation and social distancing, he says. the state health department also makes surprise calls twice daily to check in on those in quarantine. the calls make note of the medical and other supplies they may be in need of, which are then arranged for through the primary health centres or panchayats. we realised that when you let people know that you are working with them, and not merely enforcing rules, they are more willing to listen, adds dr fettle. there are the odd defaulters in kerala as well, but few. 6. defeating fake news another challenge is to curb the fake news \ncirculating on covid-19 and counter it with a credible information source. telangana is rolling out one such digital solution to fight the misinformation. we are planning a whatsapp number, on which people can get [covid-19-related] messages verified, a website as well as an archive of fact-checked information, says dileep konatham, director, digital media, telangana government. there have also been instances of misreporting by local electronic media, such as quarantined individuals undergoing tests being reported as new covid-19 cases, only to retract the news within a few hours without even a hint of an apology. determined to come down hard on such misinformation, telangana has invoked section 54 of the disaster management act, 2005, which stipulates imprisonment and fine for circulating false alarms/warnings\u2019 related to disasters. the aiims staff has been among the victims of misinformation. on march 24, a circular from the hospital mentioned how members of its staff living on rent were being harassed or evicted by home-owners over fears that they would pass on the infection. myths help covid-19 spread. doctors must be supported, not stigmatised, says dr randeep guleria, director, aiims, adding that the pandemic is a daily evolving scenario. covid-19 is a serious threat. hospitals are taking steps to cope with the high numbers. the public needs to play a part too. if we are responsible today, it could stop the spread. 7. strengthening the healthcare force with an estimated 0.62 doctors per thousand people, as opposed to the who ideal of 1 per thousand, india\u2019s healthcare sector looks acutely under-staffed in the fight against coronavirus. according to dr devi prasad shetty, founder of the narayana health chain of hospitals, round-the-clock treatment of 2,000 patients in an icu would require an estimated 2,800 nurses, 800 resident doctors and 400 anaesthetists. at the time of community transmission in china\u2019s wuhan (a city of 11 million), 9,689 patients were \nsevere and needed to be admitted to an icu. going by dr shetty\u2019s estimate, attending to, say, 9,600 patients in delhi (a city of 18 million) will require the services of 13,440 nurses and 3,840 doctors. last year, it was reported that delhi has 4,644 sanctioned (not necessarily filled) posts for doctors while the delhi nursing council puts the number of registered nurses in the city at about 7,000. to bridge the shortfall, dr shetty recommends that postgraduate students of medicine be given the option by their institutions to serve at covid-19 icus and wards as part of their training. he also suggests that the indian nursing council permit final-year nursing students to take care of stable\u2019 patients while young doctors trained overseas be given temporary licences to work under senior doctors in india. the government also needs to ensure the safety of healthcare workers. doctors should be given personal protective equipment for practice runs and covid-19 icu simulations should be set up to teach them the safe practices, says dr shetty. 8. a protocol for safe funerals in italy, mounting fatalities prompted the authorities to call in the army for safe disposal of bodies. as with other contagious diseases, there is a strict protocol in place for cremation/ burial of covid-19 patients to minimise the risk of spreading infection. in india, in the absence of guidelines, there have been reports of crematoriums refusing to handle bodies of covid-19 victims. in delhi, the family of a woman who succumbed to the disease had to run from pillar to post for hours before the city\u2019s largest crematorium let in her body for the last rites. according to officials at chennai\u2019s kalyan hospital, the role of the hospital ends with cleaning and securing a covid-19 victim\u2019s body in a body bag, and the local administration needs to take over from thereon. a protocol that ensures the timely, hassle-free and respectful funeral of covid-19 victims is urgently required. 9. ensuring the sick know \nwhat to do the protocol for treatment in germany bans hospital walk-ins. those who feel they have symptoms are forced to stay at home, dial a number, which can take 40-50 minutes to connect, and wait for a doctor to call back to see whether or not their condition is serious enough to be treated. this has led to severe psychological stress for patients, many of whom have gone on social media to share their stories. to avoid such a situation in india, a clear guideline needs to be designed so that individuals with covid-19 symptoms know what to do. examples from italy point to the fact that the infection spread a lot more through people-to-people contact in hospitals. italian doctors have emphasised that covid-19 should be treated at home as much as possible. goa is creating an app that guides a person on the next steps to take based on a self-assessment of symptoms. but as cases rise, this may not be enough. some projections point to 300,000 cases soon. if that happens, india would collapse, as would any country, says rao. she is, however, hopeful that the situation will remain manageable. we are already one of the five countries to have isolated the virus strain. we should be coming up with a standardised procedure or guidelines soon. at this point, meticulous planning will save the day. those who are sick should be assisted with the least amount of waiting period, says rao.

[mkts/glob] but it appeared largely due to the change in methodology. hubei had previously only allowed infections to be confirmed by rna tests, which can take days. rna, or ribonucleic acid, carries genetic information allowing identification of viruses. but it has also begun using ct scans of lungs, the hubei health commission said, to pinpoint and isolate cases faster. as a result, another 14,840 new cases \nwere reported in the province on thursday, up from 2,015 new cases nationwide a day earlier. but excluding cases confirmed using the new methods, the number of new cases rose by only 1,508. about 60,000 people have been infected in total, the vast majority of them in china. the outbreak, believed to have emerged from a wuhan market where wildlife was traded illegally, has triggered a backlash against local political leaders. provincial communist party boss jiang chaoliang was fired as secretary of the hubei provincial committee, and ma guoqiang removed as party chief in wuhan, state media said. they were the two highest-profile officials to be axed since the outbreak. chinese scientists are testing two antiviral drugs and preliminary results are weeks away, although who chiefs have cautioned a vaccine could take 18 months. while the princess diamond cruise liner remained in quarantine, another luxury liner, the ms westerdam, was finally allowed to dock in cambodia after being barred from guam, japan, the philippines, taiwan and thailand over fears that one of its 1,455 passengers and 802 crew might have the virus - even though none had tested positive. the westerdam\u2019s passengers clapped and cheered on their arrival at sunset.

The Cuban strategy to control and prevent the expansion of the COVID-19, was addressed on the afternoon of this Tuesday, March 17 on the television program Round Table, where they were invited as panelists: \u2022 DR. Francisco Dur\u00e1n Garc\u00eda, National Director of Epidemiology of Minsap \u2022 DR. Pablo Feal Ca\u00f1izares, Director of the Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Center of MINSAP \u2022 DR. Jorge Delgado Bustillo, director of the central unit of Cuban Medical Collaboration \u2022 DRA. Mar\u00eda Guadalupe Guzm\u00e1n Shot, Head of the Research, Diagnosis and Reference Center of the IPK Dr. Francisco Dur\u00e1n Garc\u00eda, National Director of Epidemiology of the Ministry of Public Health (Minsap), updated on the most recent evolution in the world of the new Coronavirus SARS COV- 2, causing the dangerous and contagious disease of the COVID-19. Photo: Screen capture Exepted that since in December 2019, the first cases were detected in the Chinese City of Wuhan, the progression has been very fast. He explained that the latest figures place at 144 the number of nations with at least one case, and that there are more than 180,000 infected and more than 7,000 deceased, according to the latest data disclosed on Tuesday. Dr. Dur\u00e1n Garc\u00eda highlighted China's effort to stop the virus and pointed out that more than 98,000 contagious are accounted for outside that country with a mortality rate of 4%, above what is recorded in China at the most intense time of the infection. On the situation on the island, he confirmed the presence of two new cases of the COVID-19 in Cuba, with which they add seven patients diagnosed with that disease. He pointed out that in almost all contagions he maintained the characteristic that they have been by contact with some foreign infected. \u00abWe can not talk about that there is transmission in the country, because that will happen when we start finding people with \nPresence of the virus, with or without symptoms, which have not been related to any of the patients infected from abroad or with links with them. We prepare for that situation, \"he said. meant that in Cuba, since the month of January, the prevention and control plan of the epidemic was prepared and, since then, has been conducting a group of actions with the conduct of the main national authorities throughout the territory, since this disease requires of intersectorality. The National Director of Epidemiology of Minsap added that this plan was incorporated knowledge in different clinical, epidemiological characteristics and treatments. In our country, there is the advantage of not having a terrestrial border and a good control, the risk of entering was minimized, because the person may incubate the disease and is not detected at the time of entry. Since the beginning, the measure was adopted to isolate people with characteristics of this disease in the expected centers, which allowed maintaining close surveillance to a number of almost 25,000 people in primary care and anyone who came from risk nations of this pandemic. They report two new cases with COVID-19, so they add seven the contagious in Cuba reported that today the Laboratory of the Tropical Medicine Institute (IPK) Pedro Kour\u00ed confirmed the diagnosis of the seventh case in Cuba, where almost all They have been people who have come from transmission countries and two of them, who have had very close contacts with people from abroad. About the quarantine, it specified that \"this measure is established in each country insofar as it is complexed by the situation of it, not the international one '. When the established measures are adopted and a group of cases that do not evidence the transmission of the disease, the quarantine is not justified, he clarified. In the same way, he explained that the closures of \nLabor and teachers centers create a situation of tension and stress, processes that are known reduces the body's immunological capabilities and represents more risk. The country is aware of this and in recent days measures have been taken to avoid agglomerations, asserted. Why have not extreme measures been established in Cuba? Commenting why extreme measures such as quarantine have not been established in Cuba, it explained that this country is assumed in dependence on its characteristics. The World Health Organization establishes measures in stages. The specialist reiterated that none of the cases detected in Cuba has been transmission, but by having infected abroad. \"The quarantine is established in dependence on transmission and at this time is not justified. We work for not reaching that moment, \"he said. He indicated that the closure of schools or work centers is not prudent either until there is no transmission in the country. \"When there is no evident transmission and close schools, an extra tension is created and the immunological capacity decreases. Cuba is attentive and has become public that a group of activities with great population concentrations have been suspended, \"he said. Cuba and acute respiratory infections Mar\u00eda Guadalupe Guzm\u00e1n Shot, Head of the IPK Research, Diagnosis and Reference Center, referred to acute respiratory infections (IRA), in general, which, the specialist alleged, constitute the cause of death Of three and five million people in the world, even though in that also influence the misuse of antibiotics and other minor circumstances. \u00abThat is to say that you are historically known we have faced this kind of suffering, that mostly are viral, and sometimes accompany them inadequate use of antibiotics, in addition to confusion by the similarities of symptoms, such as pneumonia, the Bronconeumonia, etc, \"he alerted. she said that Cuba does not escape that \nReality, IRA is the first cause of death by infections in our country, but they are also a cause for hospitalization and in many cases of incorrect use of antibiotics, since most are viral, although bacterial infections can also produce them. They also generate school and work absenteeism. Between anger, he said, viruses occupy a main place and cause a wide range of symptoms ranging from rhinitis, the common cold and those that affect the lower tract such as pneumonia, bronchonneumonia and bronchiolitis in young children. Different viruses can produce the same symptomatology. In this regard, he stressed that we talk about viruses like influenza A, who shocked the world in 2009, that of influenza B, those of parainfluenza, enterovirus D68, among other emerging viruses, and also coronavirus. Follow-up of respiratory infections by the Cuban System of Cubana The head of the IPK Research, Diagnosis and Reference Center noted that the Coronavirus are a very well-known viral group, which affects many animals such as birds, bats , rabbits, horses, mice and pigs, producing respiratory and diarrhea frames, even neurological. In the 1960s, a group of Coronavirus was recognized, which affect man and become zoonoses. There are four fundamentals and all are monitored by Cuba. At this moment, a more proactive follow-up is carried out in the face of this global emergency, but the follow-up of viral and bacterial respiratory infections is daily in the national health system, she highlighted. \"Personal care can only do each person correctly,\" she said. Dr. Guzm\u00e1n pulled explained that the coronavirus are \"viruses wrapped, soft, RNA virus. For those characteristics is that so much to wash their hands or use chlorine or alcohol as part of personal care to combat them, because they are susceptible to \nthese solutions. \"The only personal care each person can do it correctly. when someone sneezes is a respiratory condition, we can infect any of the virus, if we touch a door like the mouth, eyes or nose. \"Hence the need for frequent hand washing. \"However, the coronavirus emerged in late 2019 in Wuhan is new and already known to have high similarity with the sars isolated on bats, which are reservoirs of different viruses.\" He recalled that in 2009 took force the mers with high mortality of between 30 and 35%, but located in the Eastern Mediterranean. in turn, in 2012, SARS in China was 9% lethality and behaved like a severe case. on the new coronavirus, because of its similarity to the sars virus of the bat, the specialist IPK abounded that although there may be an intermediate host not yet recognized, is likely to have its origin in bats. \"For his spicules, similar to a crown when observed through an electron microscope, it is called a coronavirus.\" Photo: capture pantallacuba has the necessary technology to carry out the test that detects the covid-19 for his part, Dr. Maria Guadalupe Guzman Tirado, head of the research center, diagnosis and referral of the IPK, said that acute respiratory infections are a cause of three to five million deaths worldwide, and Cuba does not escape that. they may cause a number of symptoms that vary by type, so that different viruses can cause the same symptoms. according to the specialist this coronavirus is diagnosed through the nasopharyngeal swab, test involved a technology not cheap, which can cost up to $ 50 and we have in the country, not only in the IPK, but also in clear villa and in santiago from Cuba. \"We also have the reagents, specialized personnel, \nlaboratories, equipment, etc ... \"he said. on IPK, the doctor said she has three major functions: research of infectious diseases, specialized service, and teaching. this center assumes infected patients and suspected covid-19 following the protocols of WHO, the Chinese experience and the experience of the country. in the case of teaching, already trained staff of the health system and other agencies Cuba, or of different sectors and coaches themselves who would be responsible for imparting knowledge in other centers. Similarly, the exchange is maintained with scientists from other parties as well as, not only for the confrontation of the coronavirus, but other diseases international health organizations. for that collaboration, solidarity specialist thanked Cuba. on the diagnosis of the new coronavirus the diagnosis of coronavirus, said he is through a nasopharyngeal swab, which is where we found particles of the virus through molecular techniques advanced, what is known as real-time PCR, technology used to identify different types of viruses. \"They are modern and expensive methods. a test of real-time psr can cost between 40 and 50 dollars, she said. She added that this technology is available in the country, both IPK and three laboratories located in the provincial centers of hygiene and epidemiology of Havana, Villa clear and Santiago de Cuba. Photo: screenshot for care closer in pablo community Feal Ca\u00f1izares, director of the unit of health promotion and disease prevention (PROSALUD), said that Cuba's actions are executed in the health system to protect people . He said that the plan is adapted to the health experience of the country and others in the world. He said the offices of the family doctor and polyclinics have been \norganizing to give closer attention. the main task underway is the identification of vulnerable groups such as people over 60 years or respiratory diseases, those living alone and nursing homes. He argued that in addition to the actions of disinfection has been strengthened active investigation by the family doctor, giving priority to this group and looking respiratory symptoms in order to take immediate action. The plan provides for the certification of each process, he said at the time explained that after conducting training activities throughout the country, now corresponds more specialized training. go to the doctor any symptoms of the communication plan, said Pablo Feal Ca\u00f1izares has been achieved greater participation of the population. the national media have provided timely, true, insisting on risk information, but without creating panic. \"The bottom line is to convey confidence, security and the need to protect Cubans.\" the pair have created educational materials that are transmitted by the media, while increasing intersectoral participation. Each agency has a task, he said it. the specialist advised before any respiratory symptoms should go to the doctor as soon as possible and must avoid leaving the country, and in case of travel and return, be checked by health authorities. \"The most important thing is that Cubans remain careful, responsibly and prudently,\" he said. Handwashing, he reiterated, is the most effective measure to prevent this disease. As for nasobucos, he urged the solidarity of Cubans, taking into account that can be made in the houses. \"Industrial production is focused on ensuring masks personnel who are directly exposed to infected or suspicious, such as doctors'.

"}, {"content": "amid covid-19 outbreak, businesses have to consider diversifying their supply chains: chan chun sing. singapore \u2014 the covid-19 situation is forcing businesses to think even harder about diversification \u2014 from making sure that their supply of labour comes from different countries, to housing their foreign workers in different dormitories, said trade and industry minister chan chun sing.   his comments came after a two-hour dialogue with about 25 corporate leaders in singapore on friday (feb 14), where they aired their concerns about the impact that the virus has had on their businesses.   mr chan told reporters that the outbreak has mainly affected tourism-related sectors, the food and beverage sectors and the retail sectors but there are some sub-sectors that are still holding up pretty well.   for other sectors, such as manufacturing, mr chan said the business leaders are not only concerned about the potential disruptions to the supply chain from china, but also the supply chains that come indirectly from china to the rest of the world and to singapore.   business leaders also cited short term cash flow as being another concern, he said, although they added that they are taking steps to diversify their sources of supply chains and labour.   he noted that because of the united states-china trade war last year, some companies had already begun undertaking measures to diversify their supply chains and it is likely that the covid-19 outbreak will push more businesses to do the same.   with regard to the supply of labour, mr chan said the business leaders agreed that there is a need to reassess where their manpower comes from so that they can avoid relying on a particular country for labour.   however, mr chan added that the more pressing issue for local businesses is ensuring that their workers do not all stay in the same dormitories.   \u201csome of the companies, especially the smaller ones, might conveniently house their workers all at the same place.   \u201cbut that is not \na very resilient business continuity plan and i think we want to help many of these smaller companies to diversify their supply chain and mitigate these risks at the local level.\u201d   to mitigate the problem of cash flow, mr chan said that business leaders can do their part by helping each other tide through the challenging times.   \u201cthe larger contractors must not withhold payment from the smaller contractors, otherwise it will impact the entire ecosystem negatively,\u201d he said.   agreeing, mr ernie koh, who is the executive director of furniture manufacturer koda and an adviser to the singapore furniture industries council, said companies whose \u201cbalance sheets are strong\u201d and can pull through the current downturn should help support those who are struggling.   \u201ci have always believed in supporting local businesses\u2026 everyone has to stay afloat and with the big boys helping the small ones, we can all stay afloat (through this period),\u201d said mr koh, who was one of the representatives present at the closed-door meeting.   businesses confident over government measures    speaking to reporters after the meeting, mr chan said he was also happy with the feedback from the business leaders that they are confident with the measures that have been taken by the government to combat the outbreak.   \u201cmany of them said they are assured that singapore has expanded its surveillance regime to help detect more cases compared to some other countries who may not have been as rigorous in their detection and surveillance processes,\u201d he said.   the business leaders also told mr chan that they were looking forward to \u201cposition themselves for the recovery\u201d and rebound from the ongoing crisis.   to do so, the companies have taken advantage of the current situation to strengthen the training of their workers, review their current business models and production processes, said mr chan.   \u201ci think this speaks very well for our business community that while they manage the current situation, they \nalso have an eye for the future to make sure that we can be the fastest one to recover (from the crisis).\u201c   mr alexander melchers, vice-president of the singapore national employers federation, said that after the sars outbreak in 2003 was contained, the rebound for businesses was significant.   that is why mr melchers, whose firm c melchers gmbh & co is in the luxury goods business, has already started to make preparations for when the economy picks up again.   \u201ci\u2019m telling my staff and the people that i work with to get ready for the upturn. there will be a rebound and we want to be ready for it. the staff needs to be there and they need to be skilled, ready and motivated,\u201d he said.   measures to support workers to be announced during budget 2020   when asked on how the government will support businesses who are struggling during this period, mr chan said additional measures to support businesses and workers during this downturn will be announced on tuesday in budget 2020.   the budget speech will be delivered by deputy prime minister and finance minister heng swee keat in parliament on feb 18 at 3pm.   mr chan added that the authorities have taken lessons from previous national crises such as the sars outbreak, the global financial crisis and h1n1 when designing the measures. but since each crisis still has its own unique set of challenges, he cautioned that the measures will not necessarily be the same.   \u201cso while we can take a lesson from the past, we must also apply them in context,\u201d he said.

you should know in fight against covid-19. certain mathematical models for simulating financial markets are similar to those for studying epidemics.   we know this because we are two financial modellers who have been involved in modelling epidemics for public health authorities.   here, we would like to do our bit for public education on the covid-19 outbreak by explaining five concepts from epidemiology, which is the study of how often diseases occur in different groups of people and why.\u00a0   the hope is that when the public is better able to understand what information about covid-19 is shared, it will minimise irrational fear.   key statistics   the media has been reporting on the number of newly infected and deaths cases daily. what is equally important is the number of recoveries, which is infrequently reported by the media.   imagine this: there are 10\u00a0newly infected and three deaths one day.\u00a0this sounds terrible, but if eight people recover on that day, then there is a net \u201cexit\u201d of one patient (3+8-10) from the pool.   in any epidemic, perhaps the most important indicator is whether the net pool is increasing or decreasing.   another helpful statistic is the growth factor, which is each day's new cases divided by new cases from the previous day. \u00a0   the growth factor computed from total cases reported (worldwide) was mostly below one from feb 13 to 19, but surged back to mostly above one from feb 20 until now, as infections began spreading rapidly beyond china to other countries.   sophisticated models should also consider relevant country-level statistics, such as population, density, travel frequencies, medical resources available per capita and spare capacities in health systems to cope with infectious diseases.\u00a0   epidemic pyramid   the typical classifications in an epidemic pyramid are death, severe, mild and asymptomatic, as follows:\u00a0      learning from their sars outbreak experience in 2003, singapore and taiwan \nhave resources and operating procedures in place to reach deep down the pyramid to trace every (asymptomatic) case possible even before symptoms are shown. \u00a0   but let\u2019s be realistic.\u00a0no matter how effective the screening process is, there will be misdiagnosis.   initial statistics collected from any outbreak almost always understate the full burden.\u00a0   for example, the united states centers for disease control and prevention initially estimated 12,469 deaths for the h1n1 virus in the us from april 12, 2009 to april 10, 2010. but by 2019, it increased its estimate for that period to at least 75,000 deaths, or six times the earlier figure.   initial observed fatality statistics can be used to project the full burden with data that may take months or even years to arrive.\u00a0this is called a cross-sectional problem because we take one cross section of the pyramid to make an educated guess on the size of a deeper cross section of the pyramid.\u00a0   case fatality rate is the number of deaths over a defined period of time divided by the number of individuals diagnosed with the disease during that time.\u00a0   this is a different problem by focusing on the time dimension. as long as epidemic models are careful in drawing conclusions from data already available at specific time points, they can still provide helpful insights.   tocc (travel, occupation, contact, cluster) tracing   some countries may be too big in physical size. many lack the resources to test and diagnose every suspected case.\u00a0   moreover, many patients avoid seeking medical help until they show severe symptoms. as a result, we have to assume that a portion of undiagnosed patients may still be infecting others in the overall population.\u00a0   as long as there is a way to perform tocc tracing from the diagnosed cases, there is a path to slow down the spread of infections.\u00a0   public health officials worry the most about infections from unknown sources\u00a0\u2014 also known as the silent patients\u00a0\u2014 in which contacts cannot be \nback-traced easily.\u00a0   when the silent patients include say a taxi driver, he or she may have infected some passengers with no easy way to trace all related passengers riding his/her taxi.\u00a0   that is how epidemic control can become extremely challenging.\u00a0   those were the worrying signs observed in the early stages in wuhan and hubei, and perhaps we are noticing similar patterns emerging in japan, south korea, iran and italy.\u00a0\u00a0   treatments   from an epidemiological point of view, patients are removed from the pool by either recoveries or deaths.\u00a0   the human body does have natural mechanisms to rid itself of viruses including the covid-19 virus, but that is not always successful before the onset of other fatal complications.\u00a0   therefore, the medical goal is to increase recoveries by treatments and to decrease deaths.   certain treatments such as antibody therapy have been around since the 1970s.\u00a0the issues are what dosage to use for which types of patients, and whether there are any potential side effects.\u00a0   safe vaccines may take many months to develop by clinical trials.\u00a0   in a public health emergency such as the outbreak in wuhan, public health authorities may choose to bypass lengthy clinical trial procedures, but it is unwise if shortcuts are taken everywhere.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   epidemic models   epidemiologists describe the dynamics of how a disease is spread with mathematical models to better predict the effectiveness of disease control measures using \u201cbefore and after\u201d analyses.   impactful epidemic models require: 1) reasonable and transparent data as model parameters, or the entire exercise will become \u201cgarbage in, garbage out\u201d; 2) a research environment where model results can be discussed openly to focus time and energy on the roughly correct models.\u00a0   there is a legitimate policy concern that raw data may be prone to misinterpretations by potentially faulty analyses, creating unnecessary fear among the public.   discussions among responsible scientists can take \nplace in a \u201cmoderated\u201d but still expedited forum (such as on the medrxiv server co-hosted by yale) to encourage participation and to minimise unnecessary overreactions to preliminary results.   this way, \u201cscientifically credible\u201d clinical data can be released in a much shorter timeframe than the typical journal peer review process to allow other scientists to begin accessing the data, creating a win-win solution to address both scientific and public policy concerns.   we encourage everyone with a good grasp of these concepts to review the primary sources instead of relying solely on secondary sources to interpret the statistics.\u00a0   for example, a recent report by the world health organization collaborating centre and the mrc centre for global infectious disease analysis at imperial college london shows the estimates of the overall case fatality ratio in all infections (asymptomatic or symptomatic) of covid-19 to be approximately 1 per cent.\u00a0   the confidence range is from 0.5 per cent to 4 per cent.\u00a0at the low end of the range or 0.5 per cent, covid-19 is a low fatality but highly infectious disease like a terrible influenza, but public health officials may need to consider additional measures at the high end of the range or 4 per cent.\u00a0   armed with better understanding of information shared, the public will be more prepared until effective vaccines and treatments become widely available.\u00a0   \u00a0   about the authors:   anthony

"}, {"content": "The anger grows in China on how the Coronavirus epidemic was generated. He was given the news on Wednesday at the Hospital number 4 of Wuhan. Her father-in-law had died, one of the most of 200 deadly victims of the coronavirus that asks that city. The individual to whom a police report published on this Friday identifies how ke could not contain themselves. He pounced on two doctors and began to beat them, booting the protective clothing. He is now in police custody. It is an incident more than the many who reveal these days the fury of the public around a crisis, the coronavirus epidemic, of which they blame the disastrous management of the local authorities of Wuhan and his province, Hubei. an epidemic that has already infected about 10,000 people and in which, despite the reinforcement of supplies and the sending of thousands of additional physicians and health, sufficient protective material continues in hospitals and doctors and nurses are on the verge of exhaustion. The tension between the central government -disposed to end the epidemic and the discontent of the oblation at all costs-, and local authorities who want to avoid responsible for chaos, is evident these days, in which the accusations of the one and the other side. And the lowest step carries to lose. According to Southern Weekly magazine, and 33 municipal or provincial levels have been dismissed, admonished or have opened a file for bad management of the crisis. At discomfort for overflow in health centers, the publication of a series of scientific information has been added that corroborate the suspicions that key information was hidden during the first weeks, while the problem became increasing in December and the Greater part of January. A report from a large group of official Chinese experts, which published on Wednesday the New England Journal of Medicine, found, after examining the \nFirst 425 cases of Wuhan infection, which the contagion between human beings began to occur from mid-December. But the authorities insisted that there was no indications of this. Finally, it was admitted on January 20, when the spread of the epidemic began to shoot. \"Say that I'm furious is to stay short. I do not have words, \"he published in Weibo, the Chinese Twitter, the professor of Biology at the University of Zhejiang Wang Liming, after reading the report,\" is the first solid test that it was intentionally hidden that there were contagions between humans. \" The message of it has since been erased. A good part of the angers are directed not against the central government - the consensus among the majority of the population is that things have improved since it has taken control of the crisis - but against the provincial authorities of Hubei and the Mayor of Wuhan , Zhou Xianwang, a figure that seems to have the days counted in office. The last one in attacking against him has been the chief epidemiologist at the Prevention and Disease Control Center, Zeng Guang. In an interview with the Global Times State newspaper, it has pointed out that the Wuhan Municipal Government may have taken to respond to the crisis \"mainly due to the lack of scientific knowledge\" on the new type of coronavirus, but also by \"some indecision in the Taking measures \". During these first vital weeks, according to criticism, Zhou not only took to offering information, but he acted so that, in all, he helped to disseminate the infection. At the beginning of January he organized a meal with 40,000 people to beat a record of participation. And he insisted that people go on vacation for the Lunar New Year: before the quarantine close on the 23 million, five million people had left. He is also accused of trying to suppress information. On January 1, the Wuhan police announced that he had taken \"legal measures\" \nAgainst eight people suspected of \"spread rumors\" - a charge that can be supposed up to seven years in prison - to denounce that those cases of strange disease that had been detected seemed SARS. The severe acute respiratory syndrome, also originated in China and who killed nearly 800 people around the world in 2003, is caused by another coronavirus of the same family as the current one. This week, the police have withdrawn the accusations against eight, after the Supreme Court be very critical against the performance of that body. \"It would have been lucky if people had believed them (the 'rumors'), and it would have begun to wear masks and take precautionary measures,\" it has lamented. In a televised interview on Monday, Zhou acknowledged that the City Council did not disclose the necessary information as soon as she had her at hand and offered her resignation. But, in an unusually direct accusation against higher power stations, she said she did not do it because she did not have permission above to reveal her. \"As a local government, we can only inform (about an infectious disease) with an authorization.\" "}, {"content": "employers urged to impose leave of absence on staff who travelled during march holidays, can claim s$100 a day in support: mom. singapore \u2014 the ministry of manpower (mom) has urged employers to impose a 14-day leave of absence on staff members who travelled during the march school holidays. in support of\u00a0each employee placed on leave during this period, it\u00a0will allow eligible employers and self-employed persons to claim s$100 a day.\u00a0 \n this comes a day after the government announced that students and staff members from schools, preschools and student care centres who returned from overseas between march 14 and\u00a020 will be placed on a mandatory 14-day leave of absence from their date of return. \n in a statement on friday (march 20), mom encouraged employers to impose a similar 14-day leave of absence\u00a0for all employees returning to singapore between those dates. \n \"the government recognises that many parents have been affected by this national measure due to the need to provide care for their children during this period,\" mom\u00a0said, adding that it\u00a0is\u00a0a \u201cuseful precautionary measure\u201d for recent travellers to stay away from the workplace to prevent further transmission of covid-19. \n school holidays this year for the month starts\u00a0from march 14 to\u00a022.\u00a0 \n the ministry called on employers to first adopt flexible arrangements to allow affected employees to work from home during their company-imposed leave-of-absence\u00a0period. \n but if working from home is not feasible, they are encouraged to provide more\u00a0paid leave, and eligible employers will be able to claim the s$100 in daily support for each affected staff member who completes the leave of absence, mom said. \n self-employed persons will also be eligible to apply if they have self-imposed the 14-day leave of absence. \n however, employers and self-employed persons will not be eligible if they or the affected employee performed work remotely or if they were required to use their own annual leave, childcare leave or other paid leave during the leave-of-absence\u00a0period, mom said. \n \u00a0 \n those with affected employees placed on a mandatory stay-home notice but whose travel did not start\u00a0before the following specified dates will also not be eligible:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n travelling to mainland china on or before jan 31, 2020;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n travelling to daegu city or cheongdo county in south korea on or before feb 26, 2020; \n travelling to south korea, northern italy, or iran on or before march 4, 2020; \n travelling to italy, spain, france or germany on or before march 15, 2020; \n traveling to asean countries, japan, switzerland, or the united kingdom on or before march 16, 2020; or\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n travelling to all other countries on or before march 20, 2020. \n people given\u00a0stay-home orders must remain in their place of residence at all times, while people on leave of absence\u00a0are allowed to leave their place of residence to buy daily necessities or to attend to important personal matters.\u00a0 \n only singapore citizens, permanent residents and work pass holders are covered under the leave-of-absence\u00a0support programme, while employers with affected work pass holders will also qualify for a levy waiver. \n singapore tightened its travel restrictions on wednesday to stem the rise of imported covid-19 cases here. \n all travellers arriving in singapore after 11:59pm on friday will be issued with stay-home notices under the expanded restrictions.

daughter if the family was not going to have dinner with the maternal grandparents until \u201cthis dies down\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0   \u201cthis\u201d refers to the covid-19 crisis which has hit every continent except antarctica, and has earlier this week been declared a pandemic by the world health organization.\u00a0   and dinner with the elderly folks was out of the question till the situation improves, the general practitioner (gp) replied to her daughter.\u00a0   the 51-year-old, who works at healthmark medical clinic in punggol, would rather be safe than sorry. since the clinic is a public health preparedness clinic (phpc), a network of clinics providing subsidised treatment and medication during public health outbreaks, she could never be certain if the next patient she sees is a covid-19 carrier, and her worst fear is that she may end up transmitting the virus to her parents who are in their 80s.\u00a0   that is why she has restricted her family\u2019s visits to her parents\u2019 house to less than 30 minutes each time. even then, they would not have dinner together, unlike before.\u00a0   \u201ci can\u2019t afford for them to catch the disease,\u201d said dr chng, aware that the novel coronavirus can prove deadly for old people with weaker immune systems.   outside her consultation room is a staff nurse who is seven months pregnant.   despite being heavy with child, 38-year-old norashinta mansoor continues to soldier on with her duties \u2014 to screen, identify and separate the higher-risk walk-in patients at the neighbourhood clinic, so that the gps can be properly dressed in full personal protective equipment (ppe) when seeing the suspect cases.   asked why she had chosen to work on the frontline, even though she was given the option not to because of her pregnancy, ms norashinta said she had instinctively gone into a crisis mode after the virus landed on singapore\u2019s \nshores on jan 23. she remains unfazed at having to handle her third infectious disease outbreak as a nurse \u2014 the first two were sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in 2003 and h1n1 in 2009.\u00a0   in fact, she is feeling guilty that she will have to go on her four-month maternity leave from next month, and is encouraging her colleagues to take the necessary time off to rest before she goes away.    despite being six to seven months pregnant, ms norashinta mansoor, a clinical assistant and trained nurse with healthmark medical clinic in punggol, pressed on to work at the frontline from the start of the covid-19 outbreak. photo: wong pei ting   then, there is ms bernalyn jane tay, a senior staff nurse with tan tock seng hospital\u2019s (ttsh) national centre for infectious diseases (ncid). she had just returned from her maternity leave in the first week of february when she was tasked with managing both suspected and confirmed covid-19 cases.\u00a0   with the frontline staff\u2019s ongoing travel restrictions, the 31-year-old\u2019s original plans to breastfeed her first-born \u2014 now four months old \u2014 regularly had to be shelved as she could no longer make trips to send the pumped milk back to kuala lumpur in malaysia, where her baby is, as and when she wanted to.   she had since obtained special permission from her bosses once a month to travel, see her baby, and send two weeks\u2019 supply of breast milk. but to make up for the rest of the month, her husband would have to make at least one trip to singapore to get more milk from her.   \u201ci really miss my child, but for his safety also, i don\u2019t want to always go back as i am currently nursing confirmed covid-19 cases,\u201d said ms tay.   meanwhile, dr leong choon kit, 53, who runs mission medical clinic in serangoon, is keeping a distance of at least one metre from his loved ones, including his wife and teenage daughter.   that means sleeping on a foldable mattress at night, while his wife takes the spot on the bed. and there are no hugs and \nkisses too, he added.   sacrifices such as these have become part and parcel of life for those working on the frontline in the fight against the highly contagious covid-19 virus in singapore, which has seen a total of 200 confirmed cases as of friday (march 13).   for more than a month now, frontline healthcare workers have been grappling with lost time with family members and disruptions to their personal routines and plans.\u00a0   many have to endure working long hours under a plasticky nursing gown, goggles that could fog up, an n95 mask so snugly-fitted that it could cause a headache over prolonged use, a shower cap and gloves.\u00a0   they also have to deal with the mental strain of having to keep up with constantly changing standard operating protocols and definitions of suspect cases as the covid-19 situation rapidly evolves.   dr ng wei xiang, a senior doctor juggling duties between ttsh\u2019s emergency department and the ncid, told today that they are at \u201cversion 43\u201d of their clinical protocol as of thursday \u2014 just 50 days after the first covid-19 case was announced here.\u00a0   in recognition of their invaluable role, along with the sacrifices that come with it, deputy prime minister heng swee keat announced in parliament on feb 28 that public officers directly battling the disease will get a special bonus of up to one month, while a one-off covid-19 grant will be given to 900 phpcs, including more than 600 gp clinics, which had been activated to deal with the public health crisis.\u00a0   as singaporeans adjust to living with covid-19, today spoke to some 20 frontline workers to get a glimpse of how their lives had been upended by the pandemic.\u00a0    ms bernalyn jane tay, a senior staff nurse at tan tock seng hospital, makes a video call with her husband jason raj and son ashton raj, just after reaching home from a midnight shift at the national centre for infectious diseases. photo: bernalyn jane tay   mitigating risk in the family   in the initial days of the outbreak, when \nalarming numbers of reported deaths from china dominated the news daily and struck fear in the hearts of many, dr leong could sense from chat groups that many of his peers in the gp community were \u201cvery stressed out\u201d.\u00a0   one sunday in early february, dr leong, who doubles up as a leader of a primary care network under the ministry of health (moh), got a call from a fellow gp.\u00a0   the caller asked dr leong to look after his young children should he die from the virus, and to explain to them how he died when they are older.   \u201cit is still early! why are we talking about dying?\u201d dr leong remembered saying in reply.   dr philip koh, 54, a gp with a healthway medical branch in tampines, said a young doctor had also shared with him that for the first time, he had told his father \u201ci love you\u201d, just in case he dies from covid-19.   while such anxiety has since subsided as more scientific information on\u00a0the virus emerges, some gps today, especially those with young kids and elderly parents, remain adamant about not taking chances and\u00a0risking the lives of their loved ones.   among them is dr lee, a gp who goes beyond the moh requirements to wear the full ppe for every single patient he sees.\u00a0   inevitably, his outfit had attracted the attention of some of his patients, said the doctor who declined to give his full name.\u00a0   but the 35-year-old, who practises in an aljunied clinic and works part-time as a locum, would explain to them that it is his way of protecting his two-year-old daughter who is also looked after by his parents who are entering their 70s.\u00a0   \u201cwhen i go to work, the first thing i care about is my daughter and my family. although i care about my patients, my family comes first\u2026 i don\u2019t want to infect them. if an elderly gets it, it becomes bad and can turn into an icu (intensive care unit) case,\u201d said dr lee, whose wife is also a gp.\u00a0   noting that some of his gp friends are voluntarily wearing full ppe as well, he added: \u201cif you are a family man, you just have \nto take care of yourself and your own family first.\u201d    dr lee, a general practitioner, will not take a\u00a0chance on\u00a0dressing down when he sees patients walking through the clinic\u00a0daily, even if they declare that they do not have fever or flu symptoms. photo courtesy of dr lee   dealing with patients who are not upfront\u00a0   the full ppe is all the more necessary for him, as he had observed a trend of patients making false declarations that they had no respiratory symptoms at the front counter of the clinic, only to \u201cambush\u201d him by coming clean to him about their runny nose, sore throat or cough in the consultation room.   typically, a clinic following phpc guidelines would have triage staff segregating patients who better fit covid-19 suspect case definition from other patients to minimise any cross-transmission. the process also ensures that the gp could be forewarned to don the ppe before seeing higher-risk patients.\u00a0   dr lee got so irritated with such irresponsible behaviour that he decided to take a tally during a shift on march 5, and found that five out of the 20 patients he saw within a two-hour period were not upfront about their medical condition.\u00a0   \u201cit beats me why they don\u2019t declare\u2026 they lie even when the triage staff warned them twice about the consequences of what might happen to them if they don\u2019t declare,\u201d said dr lee.   \u201ci put my life on the line to help, so i am asking the public to be more socially responsible.\u201d   moh this week urged members of the public to be socially responsible as well, noting that despite its advisories against doctor-hopping, 38 of 160 covid-19 cases had visited more than one gp clinic, and eight among them visited more than three gp clinics.\u00a0   family doctor jody liu, father of three children aged four, seven, and nine, is also afraid of bringing the virus home and puts on an \u201calmost full ppe\u201d\u2014 goggles, an n95 mask and gloves \u2014 at work.   but while the 38-year-old does not wear a disposable nursing gown, he has been making \nsure that he changes out of his work outfit before going home. and the first thing he would do back home is to head to the shower before his kids could touch him.\u00a0   for the time being, he has also stopped wearing a watch and stopped using his phone during his two shifts \u2014 from 8.30am to 2pm and 6pm to 9pm \u2014 to reduce surface contamination. he also comes to work about 15 minutes earlier to prepare for the day and leave about 15 minutes later to clean himself and his workstation, all of which adds up to an extra one hour for his double-shift work days that he could have spent with his kids.   these are important measures as dr liu, who works at a phpc, recognises that gps like him may be called upon to assess people under the stay-home notice or home quarantine should they develop symptoms of the virus, such as fever, cough or breathlessness.\u00a0   \u201cwe are like the ministry\u2019s or the ncid\u2019s triage,\u201d he said. \u201cif we suspect them, then they get to the hospital.\u201d   manpower shortages, family members chipping in\u00a0   dr clarence yeo, from killiney medical clinic in the river valley area, had been working almost daily since february. he believes this would be \u201cuseful for the patients\u201d, since moh had advised that a patient should be reviewed by the same gp if they continued to develop symptoms after consulting one.   the 47-year-old gp who sees an average of 50 to 60 patients daily \u2014 about half of them coming in with fever, flu or cough \u2014 said he will wait for the number of covid-19 cases here to dwindle before considering taking leave.   asked when that might be, he said: \u201cit is very hard to predict. we can\u2019t say the next month, may, or june.\u201d\u00a0   regardless, he is ready to put in the hours for as long as the outbreak drags on.   in his second televised address to the nation on the covid-19 situation on march 12, prime minister lee hsien loong said the outbreak \u201cwill continue for some time \u2014 a year, and maybe longer\u201d.   dr alvina nam, 52, who runs clinic@costa located in \nbayshore\u2019s costa del sol condominium, could not find a triage staff at short notice, so she enlisted the help of her 77-year-old mother and 49-year-old sister who were also eager to lend a hand.   the two women now take turns manning a booth outside the clinic, which is on the phpc network, to record the temperature of patients at the clinic and ask pertinent questions, such as whether they have any recent travel history over the last three weeks or if they possibly have had any contact with a confirmed covid-19 case.    dr alvina nam (right), a general practitioner, with her sister ms serena nam (left) and mother mrs susan nam, who help screen patients before they enter the clinic.\u00a0photo: nuria ling/today   \u201cam i subjecting them to possible virus infection? there is always a possibility\u2026 (but) they accept the risk,\u201d said dr nam.   she added: \u201cmy mother is also old and not in the best of health. there is a small risk and certain fear, but they are generally understanding and want to pitch in during this time.\u201d   her sister, ms serena nam, a teacher who left the workforce after giving birth to her son eight years ago, told today: \u201cshe is my sister. it never occurred to me (to refuse to help). we are a very close-knit family.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0   after all, she had dealt with bigger fears than contracting covid-19.\u00a0   ms nam had been a resident in hong kong for 20 years but she recently returned to singapore so that her son could continue schooling as protests roiled the chinese city. \u201cafter all that turmoil, you\u2019ll kind of say, okay, i will survive,\u201d she said.   gps are not the only ones who are struggling with staffing woes. manpower shortages and extra shifts are also common at restructured hospitals.\u00a0   life in the ncid\u00a0   ttsh\u2019s dr ng and assistant nurse clinician ong zh hua gave today a glimpse of what life is like in the ncid, which sees three in four of the nation\u2019s covid-19 cases.   they were originally part of ttsh\u2019s emergency department team which had screened the \nhospital\u2019s initial suspected cases since december, well before the ncid\u2019s screening centre was up and running by jan 29. they now alternate shifts between the two departments.\u00a0   dr ng\u2019s most memorable shift took place on feb 5, the day after moh announced singapore\u2019s first four cases of local transmission detected at yong thai hang, a chinese health products shop at cavan road in lavender.   it happened to be his very first shift at ncid and an unexpected crowd of 300 worried individuals flocked to the screening centre to get checked for covid-19, after moh said it would be getting in touch with people who had recent close contact with individuals with travel history to mainland china.   dr ng was the only senior doctor rostered with five junior doctors then.\u00a0   \u201cthat was a very, very bad shift, but we survived because people came from all over to help,\u201d said the 33-year-old.\u00a0    dr ng wei xiang, a doctor at tan tock seng hospital's emergency department. photo: nuria ling/today   before he knew it, manpower was diverted from the team manning the emergency department. two consultants, two registrars and a few more doctors arrived to help at short notice.   and not once did he sense anyone having the attitude of \u201cit is not my problem. i am not manning this post\u201d. \u201cthey asked if i needed help even before i asked for help,\u201d said dr ng.   still, he remembered having only \u201cbarely survived\u201d that shift.   on other days, dr ng said he faced challenges such as being verbally abused by an unstable suspected covid-19 patient who screamed at him and threatened to escape from the isolation area, prompting him to call for security back-up.\u00a0   to deal with the hospital\u2019s increased caseload, dr ng also had to work extra shifts, sacrificing time with his five-year-old son and wife, who is currently four months pregnant. his wife is a doctor at the national university hospital.   ms ong, 36, meanwhile, had to forgo two weeks\u2019 leave to train nurses who were seconded to work at the \nscreening centre.\u00a0   she was supposed to spend chinese new year with her family in sarawak, malaysia, but ended up having to work on both the eve and the first day of the festival.   now that travel restrictions have been imposed on frontline workers, ms ng said she may have to cancel her plans to return to her hometown later this month for qing ming, the chinese tomb-sweeping festival.   a 23-year-old outbreak nurse at a hospital, who declined to be named, said that her busiest day entailed her and three other nurses having to settle 20 suspected covid-19 case admissions during her 12-hour night shift, as a result of contact tracing efforts.   thankfully, two nurses were redeployed from other wards so they could finish their shift in time.   she also noted having to deal with the psychological states of her patients, on top of managing their clinical needs. in one instance, she had to manage a suspected covid-19 female patient who was listed as a high-suicide risk while being confined.   \u201csome of them were actually quite confident that they didn\u2019t have it and still wanted to go home as soon as the swab test was out,\u201d she said. \u201csome who were tested positive might still be in a state of denial.\u201d    ms ong zh hua, an assistant nurse clinician at tan tock seng hospital who works in both the screening centre and emergency department, dons a full set of personal protective equipment. photo: nuria ling/today   beyond n95-inflicted \u2018battle scars\u2019\u00a0   now imagine having to deal with all these work contingencies while running around covered by a humid, overheated \u201cshell\u201d\u2014 the full ppe \u2014 amid muggy weather this past fortnight.\u00a0   as senior staff nurse benjamin ong, 29, from ttsh\u2019s department of emergency medicine, had put it candidly in an instagram post that went viral: \u201clife as a frontline during this period isn\u2019t easy, to be honest it sucks.   \u201cyou kiss your loved ones goodbye before heading to the \u2018war zone\u2019... trust me, it isn\u2019t easy to breathe wearing any of those (n95 \nor powered air-purifying respirator), and with all that protection on, you work quick and fast, catching your breath with every step you make because life matters.\u201d   he added: \u201cafter finishing your shift sweaty with tiredness, aching back, sore calf, painful ankles, you found out that not only is your annual leave frozen, you are not even allowed to leave the country as a frontline staff.\u201d   indeed, the hospital frontline workers told today it is common now to end their work day drenched in their own perspiration and dehydrated, as they were reluctant to drink more water, just in case they might need to \u201cdegown\u201d often for toilet breaks.\u00a0   besides getting \u201cbattle scars\u201d\u2014 facial imprints, pressure sores, abrasions and even blisters on their nose bridge left behind by prolonged n95 use \u2014 some frontline workers are also getting pimple outbreaks.   for ttsh nurse ms ong, wearing the n95 for more than four hours had led to pain at the point where the mask\u2019s strap cuts into the skin above the ear.\u00a0   difficulty from breathing under it has also given her dizzy spells sometimes, while some of her colleagues had felt nauseous or even vomited as a result, ms ong said.   her sweat-drenched shirt from all the running around had also caused her to feel cold mid-shift, and she had adapted by making it a routine to change into another shirt during one of her breaks.   during their mealtimes, they also have to observe social-distancing by sitting about two metres apart from one another.\u00a0   and they would have to be reminded to eat, with nurses taking turns to make sure that team-mates do not get so overwhelmed that they skip lunch.\u00a0   for dr ng, the constant use of alcohol-based hand rubs recently had caused eczema to flare up on his hands as they became dry and chapped. he had been aggressively applying steroid medication to reduce the inflammation and itch.    dr ng wei xiang, a doctor at tan tock seng hospital's emergency department, has blisters on his hands from daily use of \ndisinfecting alcohol rub that dries out the skin. photo: nuria ling/today   the full ppe had also made it difficult for co-workers at the screening centre to recognise who\u2019s who, he said. \u201cnurses didn\u2019t know where the doctors were.\u201d   to get round the problem, the frontline workers had implemented coloured caps for easy identification. senior doctors wear green caps, junior doctors blue caps, nurses white caps, while support staff wear red caps.\u00a0   at their \u201cgowning stations\u201d, there are also rows of duct tape so that workers could write their name prominently and stick it onto their gowns, dr ng said.   doctors and nurses also \u201cgown and de-gown our phones as well\u201d, dr ng said, referring to the practice of placing their clean phones in clear ziplock bags and disposing of the exposed bags in\u00a0the biohazardous waste bin, where they also dump their ppe.   the process ensures that their mobile phone surfaces stay virus-free.   emergency nurses at private hospitals, such as senior staff nurse nicholas zhu of farrer park hospital, also have to don the full ppe over long hours as and when suspected covid-19 cases are being held at an isolation area.   the 34-year-old said his perspiration had caused his goggles to fog up slightly, but he would have to leave it on throughout his entire 12-hour shift on busier days.\u00a0   morale boosters   with all the myriad of challenges, work days now seem to be longer for frontline healthcare workers.\u00a0   but ms capre rena joy sobremisana, a senior staff nurse at ng teng fong general hospital, noted how everyone has been pressing on.   \u201cwhen duty calls, we drop everything, such as spending time with our family and friends. we tend to power through a busy shift even if our bodies tell us to sit down and have a rest,\u201d the 34-year-old told today.    dr ng wei xiang, a senior doctor at tan tock seng

"}, {"content": "covid-19 outbreak set to continue beyond 2020 \u2013 what does mean for singapore\u2019s efforts to contain it?. last week, prime minister lee hsien loong said that unlike the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) outbreak which lasted four months in singapore in 2003, the current covid-19 outbreak in singapore is likely to continue for at least a year.   he outlined some baseline things singapore must get used to \u2014\u00a0such as practising good personal hygiene and social distancing \u2014\u00a0and how the country must plan for a possible spike in cases.   here, i would\u00a0like to elaborate on some key features of the covid-19 pandemic that may be less well-known and what they mean\u00a0for how singapore tackles the outbreak.   first, we know that an infected person will typically transmit the sars-cov-2 virus (which causes covid-19) to two to three close contacts, predominantly via droplet spread.   what is less commonly known is the serial interval, defined as the duration between the onset of symptoms of an infected person and the symptom onset of the people he or she transmits the virus to.   this is between four and six days for the coronavirus, longer than the serial interval of influenza (two to three days).   thus the spread of sars-cov-2 has been slower and less explosive than a pandemic influenza virus, which last emerged in 2009.   this slightly longer serial interval provides more time for contact tracing and interventions such as the quarantining\u00a0of close contacts to break the chain of transmission.   however, covid-19 is characteristically mild during the first few days, and is virtually indistinguishable from an ordinary upper respiratory tract infection \u2014\u00a0upwards of 20 per cent of patients may not have fever at the start, but are nonetheless infectious.   of greater importance is that approximately 5 per cent of confirmed adult cases will require mechanical ventilatory support in an intensive care setting.   the mortality rate was strikingly high in china\u2019s wuhan and italy\u2019s \nlombardy because hospitals were overwhelmed and intensive care facilities were not available to many who required them.   secondly, there is no proven effective treatment for covid-19 as yet, although more than 100 clinical trials are being launched.   several sars-cov-2 vaccine candidates have been developed. however, having a commercially available vaccine available in just over a year from now remains an optimistic estimate, even with expedited regulatory approval in view of the multiple safety and efficacy trials necessary.   thirdly, the contours of the epidemic have\u00a0changed substantially since the start of the year. china is no longer the epicentre of the outbreak after weeks of extraordinary efforts including the lockdown of wuhan and several cities in hubei.   iran and italy, however, became secondary epicentres for the spread of the virus to the middle east and europe respectively, while struggling to cope with their own outsized local outbreaks.   cases have now increased dramatically worldwide, particularly in europe and also the united states.   in several low- and middle-income countries in africa and asia, the number of tests done and cases reported to date remain worryingly low. there is considerable uncertainty about the scale of the outbreak in these countries.   this current state of affairs, where most territories are either at the ascending phase of their local outbreaks or where outbreak containment is beyond their means, is why sars-cov-2 will likely continue to spread around the world for the foreseeable future.   it could even become an endemic virus like seasonal influenza or chickenpox.   an effective vaccine will considerably ameliorate its impact in a way that is similar to measles and chickenpox, but it will not remove the threat entirely.   in singapore, current efforts have significantly contained the spread such that the healthcare system has not been overwhelmed despite occasional spikes of suspect and confirmed cases from different \nclusters.   nonetheless, the recent surge of cases worldwide contributed to an increase in imported cases over the past few days. some citizens from neighbouring countries also came to singapore with the express intent of seeking medical care.   these developments led to the implementation of the most far-reaching travel restrictions in singapore to date.   but unless singapore completely shuts its borders to the world for the duration of the pandemic, a drastic intervention that would\u00a0hugely impact the economy and all aspects of life here and which our political leaders have repeatedly stressed we cannot afford to do, there will be continued importation of cases.   these have the potential to generate clusters of secondary cases, adding to the ongoing community spread already present within the country.   this is not a cause for despair however, because we have been successful so far. but it does mean that long-term sustainability of control efforts becomes critical.   from the perspective of the healthcare system, the key is to prevent any of its various components \u2014\u00a0primary care, acute and community hospitals, preventive services and so on \u2014\u00a0from being overwhelmed.   this overwhelming of the system would not only result in eventual higher mortality from covid-19, but would also have\u00a0negative knock-on effects on the care of virtually all other medical conditions including, for example, heart disease, diabetes mellitus and cancer.   singapore\u2019s current approach has been to minimise the risk for sars-cov-2 to spread in healthcare settings while creating capacity within the system.   this includes: heightened alert and screening at hospital and clinic entry points, delayed elective surgeries and outpatient follow-ups, as well as severely limited clinical\u00a0\u2014\u00a0especially bedside \u2014\u00a0training for undergraduate and postgraduate healthcare personnel.   but this is an immediate adaptive response to the outbreak that is unsustainable in the medium term.   this will need to be \nevaluated with consistent policies at the national level to alleviate stress in healthcare staff.\u00a0there is also a need to monitor the training of medical and nursing students\u00a0to ensure that the current disruption of training does not affect their clinical competency when they graduate over the next couple of years.   different measures to offload pressure on the healthcare system and build surge capacity are no doubt being considered.   pm lee for instance has noted that if singapore sees very large number of cases, we will not be able to hospitalise and islolate every case like we do now.   the sensible thing to do then is to hospitalise only the more serious cases and isolate the majority with mild symptoms in the community setting, including at home.   the government has already incrementally recommended targeted social distancing practices, including the recent suspension of social activities for senior citizens aimed at protecting this particular vulnerable group.   other measures could include expanding covid-19 testing in primary care (or even at home), much like what south korea has done, and expanding the role of telemedicine in general.   cross-training a segment of the singapore armed forces volunteer corps and perhaps even full-time national servicemen to be able to use personal protective equipment and function as medical orderlies could be a radical but potential way of expanding the healthcare worker pool in preparation for a possible large surge of cases in the future.   they should ideally not be taking care of covid-19 cases, but could\u00a0help out in the care of patients with other diseases. private hospitals can be co-opted for use for public sector non-covid-19 patients as well.   in conclusion, it is unlikely that the threat from sars-cov-2 will end in 2020, and may not entirely be dispelled even if an effective vaccine became available next year.   singapore has been successful in containing the epidemic to date, but will need to adapt further and \nimplement innovative interventions in the healthcare system to ensure the sustainability of these efforts.   \u00a0   about the author:   associate professor hsu li yang heads the infectious diseases programme and is co-director of the leadership institute for global health transformation at the

The Coronavirus, new strain of the already existing, whose mutation is being investigated, put the world between the solidarity dignities and the miserability of a system that agonizes, capable of using the effects of a pandemic to impose a state of terror at a global level and justify A crisis of the bags in both the United States, Japan, Europe and others, while contradictor 37,000 soldiers to develop a maneuver in European territory, violating quarantines and any measure of control of the pandemic recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) . In addition to the severe accusations on the possibility that this virus has occurred in laboratories and disseminated at the precise center of China - for irradiating throughout the country - in Iran or Italy, several European countries are coming to several European countries 20,000 soldiers Americans, who will join the 10,000 parked in the North American military bases in Europe and another 7,000 that provides that region for a large maneuver destined to \"show muscles\" to Russia and China. This arrival of troops for maneuvers \"Defender Europe 20\" doubts the effectiveness of world quarantine and surprises that they have not canceled these exercises that suppose the transfer of soldiers towards the European front in such circumstances. To this is added a media campaign as terrific as the one that was developed in the days after the attacks against the twin towers (2001), on which they remain serious doubts with respect to the alleged responsible for the fact and on the implosing effect that He collapsed so quickly the powerful constructions with steel bases. From a point of view of the use of biological war, to which the United States has resorted several times - do not forget the hemorrhagic dengue, swine fever and others \nused against Cuba - and that supports its Israeli partner, this could be the perfect essay of how the Chinese giant would react to the imperial power and how the world would act against this situation, which is characterized by an \"uncontrollable\" virus but less Lethal than the common epidemics of Gripes and pneumonias. For now, the powerful accuse the pandemic of their economic evils, but \"the economy was already sick. The Coronavirus is one more proof that it is only maintained based on a continuous doping, \"says Eric Toussaint, political scientist, professor at the Universities of Li\u00e8ge and Paris, who is at the head of the Committee for the abolition of illegitimate debt ( cadtm) Toussaint analyzed tuning everything that happened in the falls of the bags of those large countries, especially since the last week of February 2020, the worst since the crisis of October 2008. \u00abAll factors for a new financial crisis were and are present And together for several years, at least since 2017-2018. When the atmosphere is saturated with flammable materials, at any time, a spark can cause a financial explosion. It is difficult to foresee where the spark can occur. The spark is as if it were a detonator but it is not the deep cause of the crisis. We still do not know if the strong stock market fall from the end of February 2020 'degenerate' in a huge financial crisis. But it is a real possibility, \"Toussaint holds. He also warns that \"it is important to see where the crisis really comes from and not be fooled by the explanations that constitute a curtain of smoke before the real causes.\" Meanwhile, what is being seen in Europe is nothing more and nothing less than the unmasking of the destruction of the welfare system that, with its casualties and its high, had been able to be installed in those countries. There was a certainty - which never existed in our region - that this had been acquired forever. nobody \nHe comments on the enormous embezzlement that increased expenses in the colonial wars of this century for each of the European countries. From the beginning, the United States was clear with its associates in the North Atlantic Organization (NATO): \"We have the necessary weapons, but you should pay it.\" How much Europe sacrificed to take charge of a war with invasions and occupation of countries with which it could negotiate and obtain products such as oil paid in euros, suitable for each other and in peace. The wars of colonial occupation against Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Yemen (both still ongoing), and others in preparation, have not only destroyed countries with the loss of millions of lives, humanitarian disasters, destroying sites, cities that were Heritage of humanity, cribs of civilization, violating all the rights of victimized nations and international laws, covered by scandalous impunity. These unilateral colonial wars have meant a tragedy for the peoples of Europe, victims in addition to the neoliberal impositions. To pay for sophisticated weapons and equipment of latest technology, they may have used, European governments, almost 290,000 million euros that stole the Libyan State as Chacales, as they were placed in European banks before the United States' blockade. The older \"benefited\" in these colonial wars of high criminality are the manufacturers of arms and equipment in the United States and Israel. Even American economists had warned that these wars, whose strategies were drawn up in large maps in the pentagon salons, were also destined to end the competitive capitalist block that could be the European Union. In addition to also signifying a \"war against the euro\", defended layer and sword by the German Angela Merkel, the most political capitalist ruler in Europe. at the end of the disaster \nHumanitarian who meant the invasions and occupations, these wars left the doors of Europe millions of immigrants, desperate, hungry homeless, without a country, without homeland. It is enough to look at the figures of international organizations before these brutal invasions to understand that in Libya or Syria the population had a standard of living sometimes higher than that of a common European citizen. Fleeing the war, helpless by international organizations, thousands of desperate were swallowed by the sea or destined to live as beggars battered at the horror's borders. What did Europe win in all this? Who leads the occupation of those countries? Who appropriated oil and other territorial riches? The virus that paralyzed MundoDesde early March, Chinese Foreign Ministry argues that the United States Army could have brought the coronavirus to the city of Wuhan, the most affected by the outbreak, where In October 2019, these soldiers performed military maneuvers. \u00abWhen did the zero patient began in the United States? How many people are infected? What are the hospitals called? It could be the US Army. What brought the epidemic to Wuhan, \"says a message written on Twitter on March 9 by Chinese Chancellery spokesman, Zhao Lijian. For the part of him, Philip Giraldi, former agent of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), interviewed by Hispan TV affirmed that he could have created this virus as a war weapon to harm China and Iran. In the case of Italy, several analysts remarked that this is the first European country to sign so many important agreements with China, which angry Washington. For his part, Iranian military also denounced that several studies show that it is possible that the COVID-19 is a new strategy and war form of the United States and allies against its enemies to \"generate deaths, destabilization and instability.\" The International Analyst Jos\u00e9 JOFR\u00c9 LEAL \nHe warned that it is not \"new strategies and new forms of war\", since, in accordance with research and studies, in this pandemic \"elements of conventional war, irregular war, biological war and cyber war\". He also referred to the statements of the Islamic Revolution Leader of Iran, Ayatol\u00e1 Seyed Ali Jamenei, who ordered mobilizing himself to face a biological war before the hypothesis that the bud of the Covid-19 is an attack of this type, arguing that States United would be using the new Coronavirus as a biological weapon. \"Above all, the Chinese themselves have admitted the possibility that US troops have incorporated China Coronavirus,\" said this expert in reference to the maneuvers they carried out in Wuhan. Robert Redfield, Director of the Centers for the Control and Prevention of Diseases (CDC) of the United States, admitted on March 11 publicly that some Americans, who apparently died of influenza, were positive in the test of the new coronavirus in the diagnosis final. In the same way, the spokeswoman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, Mar\u00eda Zaracajova, considered the accusations of the United States as \"deliberately false\" by the Coronavirus, recalling that the Secretary of Commerce of that country, Wilbur Ross, said in February Last to Chinese Global Times newspaper I saw the virus as \"an opportunity\", as it could help the recovery of jobs in the United States in the midst of the commercial war that Washington maintains with Beijing. In this same environment, WHO made a warning that the times are shortened to eradicate the coronavirus, which became a pandemic - not both by mortality figures, minor than the flows and seasonal pneumonias - but by the amount of Affected countries, especially expressing their concern about cases given in Italy that do not have a \"epidemiological bond \nSure \"with what happened in China. In this framework of multiple situations, the media of the system conceals truths, and against a humanitarian tragedy do not hesitate to manipulate the information and also use them as weapons of a blind war. Between so many shadows, from a small island in the Caribbean, as it is Cuba, despite being blocked by the largest power in the world (United States), they have left the medications that have made possible the control of this disease in China, associated with The Cuban government to produce medicines in a great Chinese laboratory. While the governments of ultraramentch and coupists in Latin America have stripped their populations of the only medicine they have received throughout their lives from the Sacrifices Cuban Medical, as has happened in Brazil, Bolivia and other places, condemning the Peoples on abandonment in health, Italy requested the Cuban government for its medical aid. These are the lights and shadows of a moment of great fragility that the world lives and in which it is evident that solidarity is the greatest antidote, but also the certainty that we can not let it continue playing warping, that we know that It means the end for humanity.

It is considered the major political propaganda act of the People's Republic of China. The images of the Founding Father of the country, a historic leader of the Chinese Communist Party, founder of Maoism, ran world. Mao Ts\u00e9-Tung had his summer residence in Wuham, the capital of the province of Hunan where he was born in the poor village of Shaoshan, four hundred kilometers, where still idolizes the leader today. The occasion is celebrated every year, thousands of Mao worshipers enter the Yangts\u00e9, but the city that leseth is no longer the same, became the mecca of capitalism to Chinese, ripped by skyscrapers, populated by western chain stores of clothing, 'fast-food', attended by thousands of students from one of the largest Chinese universities and cradle of production units of the large automotive industry brands, which already took the comparison with Detroit, before the decline of the American city .

Still, a few days after the alarm was more than six thousand cases throughout Central China, hundred and a half of deaths, and the cases register in Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and other Asian countries, but also in Australia in United in South America and Europe. It was hoped that 15 million people passed through Wuham during the Chinese New Year miniferias period - perhaps many could have gone a few kilometers north to the archaeological site of Panlongcheng, dating from the Shang Dynasty, between 1600 and 1046 a.c.

Fifteen years later, the troops commanded by Chiang Kai-Shek conquered the city, breathtaking to the control of the territory by the alliance between his Kuomintang (KMT) and the Communist Party, who understood the whole Southeast of the country. But Wuhan was also symbol of the division between KMT and the Communists.

Before the Japanese advance, the KMT government was forced to leave the capital, Nanjing, withdrawing to Wuhan and then to the remote city of Chongqing. In July 1967, at the height of the cultural revolution, the so-called 'Wuhan' incident has occurred: an armed conflict between two groups fighting for the control of the city. The two opposing forces were the 'million heroes' and the' General Headquarters of Wuhan 'workers'. The first integrated 500 thousand people, especially qualified workers, civil servants and the party, and was supported by the commander \nof the Wuhan Military Region, General Chen Zaidao. The 'General Headquarters', with so many supporters, was composed of workers and students of the Red Guard. Involved in a war of propaganda to obtain the support of the local community - Mao was president of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and had already swim in the waters of Yangts\u00e9. Twelve days later, on July 28, 1966, the representatives of the Red Guard wrote to Mao, claiming rebellion and revolt to carry on the cultural revolution. Many people accused of being contrastevolutionary were embarrassed to suicide. During the 'August Red' of 1966, there were 1772 dead alone in Beijing. In Shanghai, there were 704 suicides and 534 deaths related to the cultural revolution in September. In Wuhan 62 suicides and 32 murders were recorded. The 'Wuhan incident' was considered crucial in the evolution of the so-called proletarian cultural revolution.

"}, {"content": "covid-19: hopes for vaccine rise after chinese scientists find infected monkeys developed immunity. hong kong \u2014 scientists who infected monkeys with the coronavirus that causes covid-19 have found that those that recovered developed effective immunity from the disease \u2014 a potentially important discovery in the race to develop a vaccine.   but the researchers also found that the animals could become infected through their eyes, which means wearing a face mask may not be enough to protect people from the disease.   scientists around the world have been racing to develop a vaccine and the first clinical trials could be held in china and the us within a month.   but a number of cases, where people who had tested negative for the disease and were discharged from hospital only to give a positive result a few days later, have cast doubt on the process.   the rate of reoccurrence ranged from 0.1 to 1 per cent nationwide, according to china\u2019s state media reports. however, in some provinces such as guangdong up to 14 per cent of the discharged patients had reportedly returned to hospital because of the test results.   if it turns out that these patients had been reinfected by the same virus, then vaccines will not prove effective.   but the monkey experiment carried out by a team from the chinese academy of medical sciences may help dispel that fear.   details of the experiment were made available last saturday (march 14) on biorxiv, a website for studies pending peer review.   professor qin chuan wrote that his research team infected four rhesus monkeys with the covid-19 strain and the animals started to show signs of sickness three days later.   they developed a fever, started struggling to breath and lost their appetite and weight.   on the seventh day of the experiment, prof qin euthanised one of the monkeys and found the virus had spread throughout its body from nose to bladder with visible damage to the lung tissues.   the remaining monkeys, however, recovered gradually \nand eventually stopped showing symptoms.   about a month later, after tests returned negative results and x-rays showed their internal organs had fully recovered, two monkeys were dosed with the virus through the mouth.   the scientists recorded a temporary temperature rise, but other than that everything appeared to stay normal.   autopsies were performed on these two monkeys about two weeks later, and the researchers could not find a trace of the virus in their body.   meanwhile, very high antibody levels were detected after the second week, suggesting that the immune system was prepared to fight the disease.   prof qin said the results would have \u201cimportant implications in evaluating vaccine development\u201d.   the researchers argued that the positive test on some recovered patients may be down to some other cause rather than the patients becoming reinfected.   \u201cit may be attributed to \u2018false negative\u2019\u2026 test results before their discharge or the patients not making a full recovery even though they meet the criteria for a discharge,\u201d they wrote.   the animal experiment supports observations made by some doctors on the front line in the fight against the disease.   professor zhong nanshan, a leading government scientist, said in guangzhou last week that they had found a strong presence of antibodies in recovered patients, which meant the virus could no longer use them as a carrier again.   \u201cnow the question everyone cares about is whether the close contacts and family members may be infected because (the patient) tested positive again. so far i have not seen any evidence,\u201d zhong said.   nonetheless, the government has taken precautions. from march 5, all patients discharged from hospitals need to stay in a quarantine facility for another two weeks.   a doctor, who works at a public hospital in beijing looking after covid-19 patients, said the experiment provided valuable information because monkeys are genetically close to humans but \u201cwhat happens on monkeys does not \nalways work on us\u201d.   the doctor also said that a recent case in japan has caused \u201csome concerns in medical circles\u201d after the health authorities reported that a 70-year-old patient who had recovered was hospitalised again for developing covid-19 symptoms such as fever and difficulty breathing.   in a separate experiment involving three monkeys, prof qin and colleagues also found evidence to suggest people could be infected through the eyes.   dr wang guangfa, a senior medical expert from beijing, was infected after a trip to wuhan to investigate the early outbreak despite wearing a face mask and other protective gear.   dr wang suspected that the virus entered into his body through the eyes as he wiped sweat from his forehead, but had no evidence to support the theory.   he later recovered at home in beijing with relatively mild symptoms.   to verify the theory, prof qin and colleagues dropped a solution containing the virus into two monkeys\u2019 eyes.   to their surprise, the researchers did not find the virus on the surface of the monkeys\u2019 eyes the next day. but several days later, both animals tested positive.   further investigations showed that the viral strain might have landed on the conjunctiva, a tissue lining the inside of the eyelids and covering the white of the eye, and then travelled through the tear duct before ending up in the upper throat.   however, the infection suffered by the monkeys appeared to be less severe than that of another animal that had caught the virus through the throat, according to another paper posted by prof qin on biorxiv last saturday.   according to several other recent studies, the new coronavirus can survive in the air or on metal surfaces for days.   the scientists wrote that their findings suggested that people should be more aware of the need to protect their eyes.   they argued transmission could be cut by \u201cregular hand-washing in daily life and wearing protective eyewear when in close contact with patients or in crowded \nplaces, especially for clinicians\u201d. south china morning post "}, {"content": "china's controversial quarantine measures worked, prominent epidemiologist argues. beijing (caixin global) - china's controversial quarantine measures limited the size of the country's covid-19 outbreak and should be kept in place until late april, according to a study by a prominent chinese epidemiologist. \n the study, led by dr zhong nanshan, who has spearheaded china's effort against covid-19, was published last month in china's journal of thoracic disease, of which he is editor-in-chief. it defended various measures taken by china since late january to control the spread of the virus, including citywide lockdowns, forced quarantines and shutdowns of public transportation. \n critics have charged that these moves were ineffective, violate the rights of individuals, and were too late to materialise after the discovery of the virus, and initial efforts to warn the public of its danger were suppressed. \n yet dr zhong argued that these measures managed to quickly reduce the number of new cases. the study said that they also cut both the number of peak \"active infections,\" which refers to the number of people ill at the height of a region's epidemic, and the predicted total number of infections by the end of the epidemic. \n nevertheless, at a feb 27 press conference in guangzhou, south china's guangdong province, dr zhong said that the paper had been rejected by at least one \"authoritative\" overseas medical journal, though he did not say which or why. \n using a version of the \"susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered\" mathematical modelling technique, the study predicted that with the quarantine measures in force at the time of its publication, the epidemic in china would peak on feb 28 with 59,764 cumulative active infections, dwindle by late april and result in about 122,122 cases in total by the end of the epidemic. \n this contrasts with modelling done by overseas infectious disease experts, with one study estimating the country's covid-19 cases would reach 160,000 by early february. while dr zhong's figures more closely match china's official case numbers, caixin has previously reported that the official tally excludes a significant portion of people who have tested positive for covid-19, namely those without symptoms. \n according to dr zhong's team, a five-day delay in implementing the country's various lockdowns would have tripled the total number of infections in the country. taken five days earlier, the measures would have cut the number of cases nationwide by two-thirds. \n meanwhile the paper predicted that infections in hubei, the province hardest hit by the outbreak, would peak on feb 20 at 42,792 cases, then grow to a total of 59,578 by late april, when the outbreak is expected to near its end. \n had interventions been delayed, both hubei's active infections and total cases would have been over 2.6 times the current projected amount. had the interventions been introduced five days earlier, the epidemic peak should have arrived five days earlier, with the total case number not exceeding 25,000. \n the study argues that if hubei had ended its restrictions on movement after the extended chinese new year holiday concluded in early february, the province would have had a second peak in infections in march. \n the authors found similar trends for guangdong and zhejiang, two other provinces hit hard by the virus. \n \"the continued policy of 'early detection' and subsequent isolation might be effective in preventing a second epidemic wave in guangdong and zhejiang,\" the study said. \n the paper cautions that the return of migrants to chinese cities, broadened testing and climate factors could affect the number of cases and that \"the policy of strict monitoring and early detection should remain in place until the end of april 2020.\" \n this story was originally published by caixin

"}, {"content": "best strategies against coronavirus that have worked in east asia. singapore, a tiny city-state of less than 6 million people, had one of the earliest and biggest clusters of cases of the coronavirus in early february, before it began its rapid, inexorable expansion around the globe. within weeks, the country's tally of infections with the highly contagious virus that causes covid-19 was overtaken by skyrocketing caseloads in south korea, several european countries and the u.s. some strategies are proving more effective than others in containing the pandemic: pro-active efforts to track down and isolate the infected, access to basic, affordable public health care, and clear, reassuring messaging from leaders. east asia's experience with the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars), which also originated in china, has likewise helped. since testing rates vary widely, it's hard to know for sure. but singapore appears to be among the handful of places that tick all those boxes, though recent spikes in new cases show that any lapses can have dire consequences. singapore's first case, confirmed on jan. 23, was a 66-year-old man from wuhan, the chinese city where the disease was first detected in late december. by mid-february, the number of recovered patients in the southeast asian city-state was outpacing new ones. that changed in early march after 47 cases were tracked to a feb. 15 dinner gathering. as of wednesday, singapore had 266 confirmed cases and no deaths from the virus. as new infections increased, the government tightened quarantine controls. taiwan, a self-governed island off the coast of mainland china, has confirmed just 77 cases and one death. most recent cases were residents returning from overseas travel. hong kong has reported 167 cases and four deaths. its leader, carrie lam, on tuesday warned against all outbound travel and said any people arriving from outside greater china will face 14-day home quarantines or medical surveillance. \nof the 13 cases found in the tiny gambling enclave of macao, 10 have recovered. casinos have been closed for weeks to battle the outbreak. cambodia, which has confirmed a dozen cases, last weekend moved to stop foreigners traveling from france, the u.s., spain, germany, italy and iran after several new cases were found among travelers. thailand, likewise, appears to have kept cases under control with aggressive public health campaigns intended to minimize infections, though new cases jumped recently as stepped-up testing found clusters linked to a boxing tournament and an evening gathering at a bar. so far, 177 cases have been confirmed among 70 million thais, even though it's a top destination for travelers, especially from china. assuming the numbers reported to the world health organization are accurate, many of the countries with lower caseloads are relatively isolated geographically: singapore, new zealand, nepal, bhutan, sri lanka, mongolia. some others may be latecomers in testing and reporting: russia, indonesia, vietnam. for singapore, taiwan and hong kong, the experience of battling the 2003 sars outbreak, which infected some 8,000 people and killed nearly 800, helped ensure residents took the risks seriously, experts say. \"almost everyone played ball and followed accordingly,\" said leong hoe nam, an infectious diseases specialist at singapore's mount elizabeth novena hospital. \"sars was our baptism by fire and we were forced to learn everything by swimming in the deep end of the pool.\" after the sars outbreak, when 238 people were infected and 33 died in singapore, the city revamped its already excellent health care system, writing up new protocols for containing outbreaks. it set up \"fever centers\" to isolate suspected cases, invested in equipment and improved training in handling infectious diseases, leong said. so when the first case of covid-19 was discovered, singapore was ready to act, he said. from feb. 1, singapore blocked entry and transit for \nnew visitors who had traveled to mainland china within 14 days. these restrictions have since expanded to include visitors with recent travel to iran, northern italy or south korea. when the number of local cases without links to previous cases or travel in china surged, the government raised its alert to \"orange,\" the second-highest level, on feb. 7. the singapore air show, a huge event that draws thousands, scaled back the number of participants and barred most exhibitors and visitors from china from attending. good hygiene and avoiding handshakes were recommended. the national public health laboratory, set up after sars, was prepared to fast-track testing, using advanced diagnostics and newly developed covid-19 test kits. rapid testing and isolation of suspected cases, and painstaking tracing of contacts, helped by police, surveillance videos and atm records, have helped prevent a worse local outbreak, said tikki pangestu, a visiting professor at the lee kuan yew school of public policy and former director of who's research policy and cooperation department. once a covid-19 case is confirmed, singapore embarks on \"diligent contract tracing,\" said pangestu. it ordered workers arriving from countries with endemic virus infections to stay home. worship services were suspended in favor of livestreaming after a cluster was found at a church. schools suspended mass assemblies and staggered recess. so far, 5,700 people have been quarantined. in thailand, too, public health workers have gone door-to-door to track down contacts, said thanarak plipat, deputy director-general of the disease control department of the health ministry. \"we must go see them ourselves. this is an old public health way. we do our best,\" he said. it has mostly worked. but newly confirmed clusters show one dinner, one boxing match or one religious gathering can undo weeks of work. initially, germany was thought to have done relatively well at slowing the spread, but infections there have jumped to \n9,360. in south korea, where more than 270,000 people have been tested, newly discovered cases are dropping sharply, but clusters are still popping up, at a call center, at a church. this week, malaysia has reported a surge in cases linked to a religious gathering in its capital last week. cambodia, thailand and indonesia also have confirmed new cases linked to that gathering. it's unclear if the strategies used in an authoritarian society like singapore would work in bigger countries whose citizens expect greater personal freedoms: in march, a chinese couple was charged under singapore's infectious diseases act for misinforming health officials and obstructing contact tracing. if convicted, they may be imprisoned or fined. but as virus controls expand to unprecedented levels in many other countries, the policies are looking prescient. singapore is a small island with strong public trust in the government, \"a strong healthcare system, excellent information systems and plenty of money,\" said pangestu. \"many other countries, especially developing ones, do not have these capacities or characteristics.\" prime minister lee hsien loong, lauded for adopting a calming, clear approach early on, said in a televised talk last week that the situation was under control but the government was planning ahead, trying to free up hospital beds to be prepared for any surge in cases. singaporeans \"feel we are all in this together,\" lee said, \"and we don't leave anyone behind.\" "}, {"content": "Young disabled dies in China after his father is quarantined due to coronavirus.

director of the national centre for infectious diseases (ncid), told the straits times. the stakes are higher now that the virus has started spreading from human to human.   all patients at emergency departments are screened, and those with fever and travel history are isolated. all general practice doctors have also been told what to look out for and given a number to call if there are any suspect patients.   any such call from a doctor will activate a special ambulance which will transport the suspected patient, aged above 16, straight to the ncid. those 16 and younger will be taken to kk women\u2019s and children\u2019s hospital. this is to nip the spread of the virus in the bud. the ambulance will then be properly cleaned before it is used again.   at the ncid, the patients will be placed in special negative pressure isolation rooms, where air flows only into the rooms, not out of them.   the air in the rooms is sucked out through high-efficiency particulate air, or hepa, filters.   prof leo said the ncid has \"high-end\" hepa filters in 124 negative pressure isolation rooms which clean 99.999 per cent of contaminants, including viruses.   as an extra precaution, even after it has gone through the filters, the air is further cleaned with ultraviolet rays.   it will take the laboratory between four and eight hours to determine if the patient is infected with a coronavirus. if that test proves positive, genetic sequencing will be done to confirm that it is the new bug. that takes 24 hours.   prof leo said there are a lot of coronaviruses but only seven, including this new one, that spread from human to human.   four types cause \nthe common cold and are mild. the other two are the more dangerous sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and mers (middle east respiratory syndrome).   fifteen medical staff in wuhan have contracted the bug, currently called the 2019-ncov.   prof leo said that it is not yet known whether this virus is as dangerous as sars.   but singapore is not taking chances. all medical staff dealing with suspected cases are well protected with personal protective equipment (ppe). laboratory staff will also have ppe and powered air purifying respirators - to filter out any possible virus.   prof leo said singapore has a stockpile of the disposable ppe as well as the powered air purifying respirators - enough to supply all hospitals should a major outbreak occur here. \"yes it is expensive, but protection of staff is the most important thing,\" said prof leo, a veteran of the sars outbreak in 2003, when medical staff caring for infected patients were among the 238 people infected and the 33 who died.   the 330-bed ncid, which opened slightly over a year ago, has more than 100 \"surge beds\" which are kept empty and on standby for national emergencies.   although the flu vaccine does not protect against the wuhan bug, she said it is a good idea to get vaccinated. on a national level, it will \"cut down on the background noise\".   she added that should there be a positive case of the wuhan bug here, people will be told.   \"we need to be able to share the information and be able to guide the public, as well as the entire public healthcare system, to be able to handle the situation,\" she said.   wider definition   singapore's ministry of health has widened its definition of suspect cases,

in china within a fortnight of getting ill will also be treated as a suspect case.   more screenings \nfrom today, changi airport will conduct temperature screening for all flights from china, and not

"}, {"content": "covid-19 and climate change have a lot more in common than you think. climate scientists tell us that climate change will not only bring about rising sea levels and more extreme weather events, it also increases the likelihood of epidemics. but despite the clear linkage between the two, our response to the current covid-19 pandemic is almost completely opposite to our usual response to climate change.   while the coronavirus can be fatal, the risk that one will die from the disease is (still) low. nonetheless, governments in hard hit areas have acted promptly to declare \u201cwar\u201d on the pandemic while societies have made large sacrifices to contain the disease.   with climate change, while the impacts are far greater in terms of loss of lives and risk to the very survival of the human species, mitigating climate change is seldom a priority in a government\u2019s resource allocation decisions.   in short, we respond to epidemics (when they occur) with excessive fear and pessimism, even as we routinely discount the risks of, and are naively optimistic about, the very thing that makes them\u00a0more likely.   in dealing with low-probability, high-dread events such as dying from covid-19, we systemically overestimate our risks \u2014\u00a0much like how people overestimate their risks of dying in a terrorist attack or a plane crash relative to far more common causes of death.   on the other hand, people and institutions underestimate the high (and increasing) risk of climate catastrophe. how do we explain this paradox?   probability neglect, present bias and global commons   our overestimation of risks linked to the coronavirus and our underestimation of climate risks are two sides of the same coin; they are explained by a bias called probability neglect.   when dealing with risks (whether the risk of an epidemic or of climate change), we do not rely on actual probabilities but on how easily the risk comes to mind (saliency bias), our instincts, and our instant emotive reactions (the affect \nheuristic).   the coronavirus is very salient; we are constantly inundated by news of it and daily updates of the numbers infected and dead around the world. it also evokes strong emotional reactions, especially fear. salience combined with fear causes us to believe that something is far more probable than it is.   climate change is exactly the opposite. it is usually not salient as most people believe it will occur in some distant future. climate change also does not evoke strong emotional responses in most people, except possibly for the young. being an abstraction for most people, climate risks are systematically underestimated.   the result of our collective fear is that governments prioritise the \u201cwar\u201d against the covid-19 pandemic, often at the expense of other priorities.   global supply chains have also been disrupted; financial markets are roiled by the news of the disease spreading and of rising number of infections.   the different responses to coronavirus and climate change also stem from what is known as present-biased preferences. people tend to overvalue immediate costs or benefits while discounting long-term impacts.   in the case of the coronavirus, people are willing to make immediate sacrifices as there are short-term benefits, that of being protected from a potentially life-threatening disease.\u00a0   with climate change, people are reluctant to incur even small costs today because the benefits (such as the survival of mankind and preservation of the natural environment) are in the future and, therefore, heavily discounted.\u00a0   climate change and epidemics are both problems of the global commons. effective solutions require cooperation and coordination between governments.\u00a0   but such cooperation is difficult because every country has an incentive to free ride on the efforts of others.   with epidemics, this free-rider problem is less pronounced as the domestic costs of an epidemic are high enough for most governments to take some preventive measures. \nwith climate change, the free-rider problem (and the consequent tragedy of commons) seems more insurmountable.   the benefits of not taking any climate action are internalised (that is, the benefits are fully captured by the country not taking climate action), while the costs to the global commons are externalised (that is, the costs are shared or distributed to the rest of the world).   lessons for climate action   first, there is an opportunity for those of us who wish to see more resolute climate action to use the coronavirus crisis to emphasise the causal link between climate change and epidemics.\u00a0   our message to governments and our fellow citizens should be: \u201cif you do not wish to live with more of such viruses, we must take far more aggressive action on climate change.\u201d   second, there are many things governments can do to highlight the salience of climate risks.   for example, just as the number of confirmed infections and deaths from the coronavirus has been highly visible, governments should also provide regular information on the costs and damages of climate change, as well as how these are expected to rise.   third, governments can take steps to counter our present bias. with the coronavirus, the benefits of governments taking aggressive action now are clear for all to see.\u00a0   with climate change, governments need to find ways to create a sense of crisis to persuade their populations that the costs of climate change are already upon us, and that the sacrifices needed to deal with it cannot be delayed anymore.   finally, the costs of climate change do not have to be fully internalised for countries to take action; they only need to be sufficiently internalised.\u00a0   that the coronavirus began in china, the fastest growing emitter of carbon emissions, also creates an opportunity for china to play a leadership role in climate change mitigation. by doing so, china would also reduce the risks of future epidemics.   \u00a0   about the authors:   donald low is senior \nlecturer and professor of practice in public policy at hong kong university of science and technology, where xun wu is professor and head of the division of public policy. they both teach at the university\u2019s master of public policy programme.

to combat the threats posed by the covid-19 outbreak. at that time, there were 800 confirmed cases outside of china.   the outbreak has escalated quickly. three weeks after my budget speech, on march 11, the world health organisation (who) declared covid-19 a pandemic, recognising the severity and risk of further global spread.   today, the who estimates that the number of people infected has exceeded 410,000, across more than 190 countries.   the covid-19 outbreak is a battle on many fronts - medical, economic and social.   first, on the medical front, countries are taking extraordinary measures to contain the spread of the virus, so that their healthcare systems are not overwhelmed. many countries have implemented lockdowns, while the united states has declared a national emergency.   in singapore, we are doing everything we can to keep you and your families safe. we acted early and decisively. as the severity of the virus outbreak grew worldwide, we stepped up our measures. this has, so far, helped to keep the number of cases at manageable levels during the first wave.   however, as much as we try, the covid-19 pandemic is likely to take at least a year to be resolved, and the economic repercussions would last even longer. the world is seeing successive waves of infection, and importation of infections. we must be prepared to take further tougher measures.   yet, measures on the medical front to contain the pandemic, both in singapore and around the world, have made the second front of the battle - the economic front - even more difficult. these public health measures have caused severe economic disruptions and uncertainties. as more countries implement their measures, the economic disruptions will be wider, deeper and more prolonged.   the global economy is now facing both a supply and demand shock.   on the \nsupply side, supply chains have been disrupted as locked-down workers are unable to work. with highly integrated global supply chains, a disruption in any one part of the chain, or in any one country, will have knock-on effects worldwide.   passengers at changi airport on monday, one in a protective suit, mask and shoe covers. the extraordinary situation of the pandemic calls for extraordinary measures, says deputy prime minister heng swee keat. photo: reuters   on the demand side, aggregate demand has fallen as people stay home and curtail spending. consumer and business confidence are plunging in the face of growing uncertainties.   the international monetary fund has downgraded its 2020 global growth forecast three times since january 2019, and flagged that a further downgrade is imminent in april. it added that it expects a recession at least as bad as during the 2008 global financial crisis.   global financial markets are being roiled by the mounting uncertainties and cutback in economic activity. stock markets have come down from their peak some weeks ago.   the s&p 500 index took only 22 trading days to fall by 30 per cent from its peak, making it the fastest drop of this magnitude in history. the key volatility indices in europe and the us, which some call the \"fear index\", briefly reached levels last seen during the global financial crisis.   credit has tightened across the world, and the us yield curve has fallen below 1 per cent for the first time in history. the disruptions around the world will significantly curtail global demand, disrupt supply chains, and possibly lead to financial shocks. as an open economy that is highly integrated with the global economy, we will be deeply impacted by these global shocks.   based on advance gross domestic product (gdp) estimates released this morning, in the first quarter, the singapore economy contracted by 10.6 per cent quarter on quarter, or 2.2 per cent year on year, reversing the 0.6 per cent growth in the \nprevious quarter.   this morning, the ministry of trade and industry further downgraded singapore's gdp growth forecast for 2020, from a range of minus 0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent announced last month, to between minus 4 per cent and minus 1 per cent.   this extraordinary situation calls for extraordinary measures.   last month, i committed $6.4 billion in the unity budget towards the stabilisation and support package, the care and support package, and to support our front-line agencies.   today, i will introduce measures worth over $48 billion in this resilience budget, to deal decisively with the situation at hand. this is over seven times of the first tranche.   altogether, we are dedicating close to $55 billion to support our people in this battle, amounting to 11 per cent of our gdp. this is a landmark package, and a necessary response to a unique situation.   the government has sought and obtained the president's in-principle support to draw up to $17 billion from our past reserves to fund part of the resilience budget.   the resilience budget focuses on three key areas:   \u2022first, save jobs, support workers and protect livelihoods.   \u2022second, help enterprises overcome immediate challenges.   \u2022third, strengthen economic and social resilience so that we can emerge intact and stronger.   let me now elaborate on our considerations for drawing on past reserves in this budget, and our fiscal position after the measures that i have put forth to tackle the covid-19 pandemic.   our reserves are our strategic asset, built up through the discipline and prudence of our people and political leaders, across generations.   our reserves serve as our bulwark against shocks and crises of an extraordinary nature. for a nation with no oil, no gas, no gold, no diamonds, or natural resources of any kind, it is remarkable that we have built this up.   our prudence and discipline in saving and growing our reserves give us the wherewithal to respond decisively when our nation faces \nextraordinary circumstances.   our founding fathers created a rigorous framework to ensure that such strategic assets are used only for the right purpose. we amended the constitution in 1991 to provide for an elected president who is the custodian of our past reserves.   under article 148a of the constitution, the president can withhold her assent to any supply bill if she is of the view that it is likely to draw on past reserves.   our principle is that each term of government must live within its means. any additional spending that the government of the day proposes must be funded in a sustainable manner - recurrent expenditures should be funded from recurrent revenues.   past reserves can be drawn down only in exceptional circumstances, under a two-key system, if the president, after consulting the council of presidential advisers, agrees with the government's proposal to draw on the past reserves in exceptional situations.   despite political pressure to dip into the reserves, the government has scrupulously upheld the principle that past reserves are to be used only for exceptional situations.   until now, the government has drawn on past reserves only once, during the global financial crisis, when the president approved a draw of $4.9 billion to fund the jobs credit scheme and special risk-sharing initiative.   during that period, the government also sought the president's concurrence to use $150 billion of past reserves to back the deposit guarantee scheme. i was at the monetary authority of singapore (mas) at that time. we had asked for this, and it took us a long time to deliberate on this. as it turned out, the guarantee was not triggered, and there was no draw on past reserves.   the covid-19 pandemic, and the multiple threats it poses to our nation, is the sort of event that we had accumulated reserves for.   we have saved up for a rainy day. the covid-19 pandemic is already a mighty storm, and is still growing.   if over the years we had frittered the \nreserves away, on more immediate but less existential needs, big and small, as some in this house have pressed the government to do, we would be in a much weaker position today.   we are experiencing a confluence of multiple external shocks - a pandemic that has triggered many nations to shut their borders, limit exports and halt economic activities, in order to fight this pandemic.   this economic impact is magnified, as the global economy is already fragile, and further weakened by a protracted us-china trade conflict, and an oil price war.   so this is not a normal business cycle that we would have anticipated and dealt with using the revenues collected by each term of government. it is a \"black swan\" event that comes only once every few decades.   in view of the exceptional circumstances, the government has sought the president's in-principle support to use past reserves to fund part of the package.   the covid-19 situation is fluid and fast-moving, and nobody is quite sure how it will develop. but because we have prepared ourselves well, singapore has the resources to meet this crisis with confidence.   we will use our resources to get through this together.   the government will continue to monitor the situation closely. should it become necessary, i am prepared to propose to the president further draws on past reserves to deal with the situation. i trust that every member of this house will deeply internalise the mission to be careful stewards of our reserves.   the measures that i have announced today will raise the overall budget deficit for fy2020 to $39.2 billion (7.9 per cent of gdp). we are able to support this unprecedented deficit, and still remain fiscally sustainable, because we have been disciplined in the use of past reserves, tapping them only in exceptional circumstances like these.   the situation remains highly fluid and uncertain, with significant risks. our fiscal position will be affected from both the revenue and expenditure sides.   with \na weak gdp outlook, our revenues will be affected. sentiment-driven revenues may come down sharply.   while revenues are coming down, our expenditure will be going up, to enable us to respond effectively to the crisis. in the past few years, we benefited from unexpected revenue upsides, such as exceptional statutory board contributions from mas and increased stamp duty collections. we cannot hope to rely on a repeat of this. instead, we must be prepared to bear the down sides when they happen. because we have been prudent and did not decide to spend all of the surplus that we collected, we are ready to meet such downsides.   we can expect significant volatility in the economy, and in financial markets, in the near future. we will need to continue to review our expenditure plans very carefully in this fluid situation. we will adopt a nimble fiscal posture, so that we can quickly channel the resources at hand to the most urgent and important needs of our people.   the covid-19 pandemic is the most serious crisis we have faced in a generation.   it has put all countries around the world to the test - on the medical, economic and social fronts.   we have been able to respond boldly and decisively to the outbreak in singapore, because we have forged a cohesive, resilient society. the whole nation has come together in response. our healthcare and front-line workers are working tirelessly to care for the infected. our cleaners are doing humble but heroic work to keep our environment clean.   thousands of public officers are working round the clock to respond to the threat of covid-19. the private sector and corporations too have stepped forward.   individuals are doing their part - vloggers and bloggers are helping to share public messages, others are volunteering, giving support and encouragement and, crucially, by complying with health advisories and practising safe distancing. these include foreigners who live among us and who care deeply about singapore.   many have \nalso had to make sacrifices in this time. families have had to make difficult adjustments to their lives, some having to undergo quarantine, cancel celebrations or put off other long-awaited plans, including wedding plans.   and despite our best efforts to work with businesses and unions to save jobs, some workers have suffered a loss of income or jobs.   the government and the political leadership are in this with singaporeans. we share the worries and anxieties of singaporeans, and we will do our best for you.   to show solidarity with singaporeans, i announced at the budget debate last month that the political leadership will take a one-month pay cut. with the deteriorating situation, we will go further. all political office-holders will take an additional pay cut of two months, altogether a three-month cut in their salary.   the president, speaker and both deputy speakers have informed me that they will join in, and take a similar three-month pay cut in total.   it is in times of crisis that the true character of a nation can be seen.   the months ahead will not be easy, as the situation continues to evolve dynamically and unpredictably. we must continue to be on high vigilance, mentally and psychologically prepared for every scenario.   the government will lead the way. we will do our best to anticipate and respond to developments, make decisions based on facts and evidence, and exercise judgment when there are trade-offs.   while we attend to the immediate and urgent tasks, we will set our sights on the long term, so that singapore comes out of this crisis stronger as a

In Europe there is thus at least 37 infected. At the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities of the World Health Organization WHO reported an accumulation of pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause in the Central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified \nNovel virus as the cause of the diseases. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days then a group released a group of the virologen Christian's premier from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 the first diagnostic test for the new virus, the researcher provisionally call 2019-NCOV. With the test, the virus can be detected in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, on which, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected. Both the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as well as Mers (MIDDLE East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses which have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more than 750 died. With the MERS virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronaviruses. Many of them relate to respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example. In China, several thousand persons are suffering from them, some of them - most of them with pre-existing conditions - have died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first infection cases outside of China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been in Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection with a tourist, who came back from Wuhan, on January 24, the first cases were known in France. Meanwhile, first cases were confirmed in Germany. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. The virus can cause pneumonia that can endally end. Since it is a viral illness, antibiotics do not help. Meanwhile, it is clear that the virus of \nMan can be transferred to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transfers after a dozen cases were known in medical staff. Medizors assume that the virus is transmitted above all over droplet infection. The World Health Organization calculates, as announced on January 24, at the moment that an infected one cuts 1.4 to 2.5 other people. Contest these numbers, the virus is less contagious than SARS and also the viral flu. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals. That can not be said yet. The World Health Organization said on 28 January that about one-fifth of the reported cases through the virus will be seriously ill, so in case of doubt must be treated intensive care. According to reports, the first death pots were patients who had some severe pre-existing conditions. Even with other infectious diseases, people with pre-existing diseases are particularly endangered - for example at the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so change their genome. This can cause you to become more dangerous for people in the course of an outbreak - but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) expects no similar mortality to the current time as the outbreak of SARS. The WHO is based on own information against the dissemination of false information regarding the new virus. They caused confusion and fear in the population, said WHO General Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \"We therefore also fight the trolls and conspiracy theorists who spread false information, making the work against the outbreak,\" Tedros said. One is for this with numerous social networks in \nContact. \"We asked you to filter out incorrect information and encourive correct information from trusted sources.\" About Instagram and YouTube, the WHO also searched for contact with influencers and influencers and asked to spread objective news about the virus. According to Tedros, the focus is on the Asia-Pacific region. According to a study of Chinese scientists and scientists, the novel virus could also be transferable via feces. Some patients in a hospital in Wuhan had first suffered from diarrhea and nausea before the occurrence of fever symptoms and respiratory complaints, it says in a work published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The course of the disease started at ten percent of 138 patients with diarrhea and nausea, the scientists write. They said to have concentrated in the early days of the illness of all on respiratory symptoms for the first time in December in Wuhan. Symptoms associated with the digestive tract could have been overlooked. Also, the SARS virus, which is triggered by coronaviruses as well as the novel disease, had partially transmitted in this way during the epidemic beginning of zero years. David Fisman, epidemiologist at the University of Toronto warned, the contagion on feces could, especially in hospitals, represent a new challenge for curbing virus disease. As the main transmission path of the virus, droplet infection is still applicable to the cough of a suffering.

york city's vast city park \nnetwork ahead of a ban on congregating in groups that goes into effect sunday night, cuomo said. \"you can wind up hurting someone who you love, or hurting someone wholly inadvertently. social distancing works, and you need social distancing everywhere,\" cuomo warned. as new coronavirus cases in china dropped to zero several days in a row, the chief medical officer for the international clinic of wuhan was alarmed at those elsewhere refusing to follow rules to contain the virus. dr. philippe klein said people should look to china's confinement of tens of millions as an example to emulate \"with courage, with patience, with solidarity.\" \"i exhort you, the french, to apply the rules in our way,\" said klein, who is french. worldwide, over 307,000 people have been infected. for most, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms. but it can cause more severe illness in others, especially older adults and people with existing health conditions. some 92,000 people have recovered, mostly in china, where the virus first struck late last year. the virus rebels tend to range from restless teens to wealthy adults who can travel to their getaway homes. even in italy, where the virus death toll soared beyond china's last week, authorities are still trying to rein in people from going outside for fresh air, sun and visits with friends to escape walled-in lives. french farmers' markets where people congregate to shop for food have posed a special challenge for police trying to keep people apart from each other at the recommended 2 meters (6 feet), along with neglected urban housing projects where distrust and disobedience of authorities runs deep. in clichy-sous-bois, a paris suburb where nationwide riots triggered by police harassment allegations erupted in 2005, a person bit a police officer trying to enforce confinement rules, said linda kebbab, a police union spokesperson. and a large crowd threatened to spit on officers who had planned to disperse them in the \nsoutheastern city of lyon but left instead, she said. in the southern german state of bavaria, gov. markus soeder lamented that \"there are still corona parties, there are young people who cough at older people and shout corona for fun and, above all, there are an incredible number of groups being formed.\" national police in spain, which has the second-highest number of coronavirus infections in europe after italy, are using helicopters to spot groups of people meeting up outdoors. then agents are sent in to break up the gatherings. spanish police have also taken to highlighting examples on social media of what people should not do in public during the country's state of emergency. in the southeastern murcia region, they posted video of police stopping a person waddling outside in a full-body dinosaur costume and tweeted that pets can be taken for brief walks by owners but that \"having a tyrannosaurus rex complex is not\" allowed. and in spain's northeastern region of catalonia, police posted a picture of a man walking a goat on a leash, apparently trying to take advantage of the pet walking exception. france now has 100,000 security personnel on the streets who are issuing fines amid a new national \"stay home\" mantra and warnings by officials that the country's two-week lockdown could be extended if the country's infection rate keeps rising. more than 1.7 million checks were carried out in the last five days and more than 22,500 people fined, the interior ministry said. by sunday, france counted more than 16,000 confirmed infections and 674 deaths. in greece, the prime minister tried to convince people to say home, warning citizens that future virus prevention measures depend \"on our behavior.\" but after florida's officials shut down some of the state's famed beaches, some businesses were still trying to draw in tourists, including clearwater mega bite shark boat, a 40-foot (12-meter) vessel with a bow shaped like a shark's snout that cruises the gulf of mexico off \nflorida's western coast. the boat can carry 50 passengers but the owner was limiting trips to 10 to comply with federal advice. only four people signed up for a saturday trip, said an employee named chase who answered the phone but declined to give his last name. \"normally we'd be packed this weekend,\" he said.

misleading advisories such as unproven home remedies being shared online; and xenophobic, racist sentiments that have no basis in fact, which are observed both overseas and in singapore.   she said that singapore has been effective in trying to plug information gaps about the virus through \u201ca very interesting and relatively efficacious playbook\u201d.\u00a0   besides daily updates about the spread of the virus, the government reinforces key messages through different channels, such as through various government ministries, the media, and experts to help people dissect the situation.   it has also wielded the protection from online falsehoods and manipulation act (pofma) to counter covid-19 falsehoods in a way that most people agree with, she said.   government spokespersons were also quick to counter rumours, she added, noting \nhow health minister gan kim yong had come out at one point to categorically refute talk that the authorities were going to raise the disease outbreak response system condition from orange level to red.   still, more can be done, she said. while the government has been providing updates usually at a certain time each day, on some days, the information may arrive later in the evening. this may create suspicions, dr soon said.   \u201cwhere there is an information gap, people will rely on heuristics \u2014 mental shortcuts \u2014 to plug the gaps,\u201d she added.\u00a0   dr jayakumar said that while singapore is prepared for one-off incidents such as terrorist attacks, the government, academics and think-tanks should do more to look at how the country can bounce back from slow-burn crises such as pandemics and climate change.   \u201cin my point of view, it is almost problematic that singapore is so safe, clean and secure. it is not normal... it is supernormal, because almost nothing of note, security-wise, seems to happen in singapore.\u00a0   \u201cnow we have to accept that these things may be there for a long time,\u201d dr jayakumar said.

Among other measures, it has declared a festive all this week to postpone the greatest \"return operation\" of the world after the New Year, in which 400 million trips are calculated. All country teaching centers will also delay the return to class until a date that has not yet been specified.\nThe Coronavirus 2019-Ncov has already spread to a dozen countries around the world, which accumulate about forty cases. The pathogen, which scientists believe that it was transmitted to humans in an animal market of Wuhan, can cause pneumonia that begins with symptoms such as headache, high fever and difficulty breathing.

A team of United States, Italy and China scientists estimated the impacts of Covid-19 propagation afterwards afterwards the quarantine in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic. Result: Travel restrictions have a \"modest\" impact on the spread of new coronavirus. Public health measures and behavioral changes, such as early detection of cases and washing their hands, are more effective.\nThe team coordinated by Scientist Matteo Chinazzi, University of Northeast (from the United States), used a Covid-19 transmission model called \"Global Epidemic and Mobility Model (Gleeam).\nThe results had already been released in the Medrxiv Health Sciences Research Portal and Friday were published in Sciences scientific journal. And there are three major conclusions. First, it was noticed that the prohibition of travel in Wuhan on January 23, 2020 delayed the evolution of the continental China epidemic of three to five days. That is, it had a \"modest\" effect.\nSubscribe newsletters for free and receive the best of the publicity and the deepest jobs of the public.\nThen, when in early February, airlines canceled to China, these restrictions helped to slow down the spread of the epidemic in the world. However, this effect was also modest. \"Even when there were 90% of travel reductions, the number of cases imported in other countries increased significantly in a matter of weeks,\" is read in a summary on the article. Finally, the team points out even in the presence of major travel restrictions in China and out of the country, a large number of individuals already exposed to the new coronavirus traveled around the world without being detected.\nThese results may be a contribution to scientists, medical and political teams fighting the epidemic. \"In the future, we hope that travel restrictions on Covid-19 in affected areas may have modest effects, and that interventions to reduce transmission enable great benefits to mitigate the epidemic,\" the authors write in the article.

of wuhan two weeks after she started to show signs of a fever, even though doctors privately told her family that she almost certainly has been infected, her son zhang changchun told reuters. yang, 53, is just one of many wuhan inhabitants finding it difficult to get tested or receive treatment for the new form of coronavirus, which authorities say has infected 2,800 people and killed at least 80 in china, a situation that may be contributing to the spread of the disease. yang has been unable to gain full-time admission to a hospital, her son said. she has been put on drips in unquarantined areas at four separate hospitals in the city to treat her deteriorating lungs, he said, while he is doing what he can to get her tested or admitted full-time. \u201cmy brother and i have been queuing at the hospital every day. we go at 6 and 7 in the morning, and queue for the whole day, but we don\u2019t get any new answers,\u201d zhang told reuters. \u201cevery time the responses are the same: \u2018there\u2019s no bed, wait for the government to give a notice, and follow the news to see what\u2019s going on.\u2019 the doctors are all very frustrated too.\u201d officially known as 2019-ncov, the new form of coronavirus was first identified as the cause of death of a 61-year-old man in wuhan on jan. 10, when china shared gene information on the virus with other countries. some, such as japan and thailand, started testing travelers from china for the virus within three days. however, testing kits for the disease were not distributed to some of wuhan\u2019s hospitals until about jan. 20, an official at the hubei provincial center for disease control and prevention (hubei cdc) told reuters. before then, samples had to be sent to a laboratory in beijing for testing, a process that took three to five days to get results, according to wuhan health \nauthorities. during that gap, hospitals in the city reduced the number of people under medical observation from 739 to just 82, according to data compiled by reuters from wuhan health authorities, and no new cases were reported inside china. despite the lack of reliable data and testing capacity in wuhan, chinese authorities assured citizens in the days after the virus had been identified that it was not widely transmissible. in previous weeks, it had censored negative online commentary about the situation, and arrested eight people it accused of being \u201crumor spreaders.\u201d \u201cthe doctor didn\u2019t wear a mask, we didn\u2019t know how to protect ourselves... no one told us anything,\u201d a 45-year-old woman surnamed chen told reuters. her aunt was confirmed to have the virus on jan. 20, five days after she was hospitalized. \u201ci posted my aunt\u2019s photos on (chinese social media site) weibo and the police called the hospital authorities. they told me to take it down.\u201d national, regional and city health officials did not respond to requests for comment from reuters on how the virus outbreak has been handled. national officials did say at a media briefing last week that there were some \u201cloopholes\u201d in initial treatment methods. wuhan\u2019s mayor, zhou xianwang, told chinese state television on monday he recognized that \u201call parties were not satisfied with the disclosure of our information.\u201d but he pointed to strictures placed upon him by provincial and national leaders. \u201cin local governance, after i receive information, i can only release it when i\u2019m authorized,\u201d he said. zhou told a media briefing on sunday that a further 1,000 people could be diagnosed with the virus in wuhan, based on the number of patients yet to be tested. china last week locked down the affected region in hubei province in the biggest quarantine operation on record and is building two new hospitals to treat virus patients. president xi jinping has created a special committee to tackle the outbreak. the country has been \npraised internationally for quickly sequencing the virus gene. however, its slow scale-up of testing has been questioned. once a virus has been identified, \u201cyou need to make sure you have all the reagent (a substance used in chemical analysis) samples and you\u2019ve got it all pushed out to where you want to do testing,\u201d said amesh adalja, a senior scholar at the johns hopkins university center for health security, who focuses on emerging infectious disease and pandemic preparedness. although information from the region is scarce, adalja suggested china has had problems with this stage of tackling the outbreak. \u201cwe\u2019re already hearing that there are shortages of medical professionals there, that there are shortages of test kits and medicines,\u201d he said. john edmunds, a professor at the center for mathematical modeling of infectious diseases at the london school of hygiene & tropical medicine, said china has not communicated enough detailed data after the initial outbreak. \u201cwe have a very incomplete picture of what\u2019s going on,\u201d he told reuters. \u201cwhether it\u2019s incompetence, secrecy, or deliberate, i don\u2019t know, but it would be very useful if we could have some basic epidemiological data.\u201d the shortage of testing supplies and china\u2019s initial reticence have drawn criticism that the country is still learning lessons from the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) in 2002 that killed almost 800 people. \u201cthe improvements have been on the hard science side - figuring out the virus\u2019s genome, building new hospitals at a moment\u2019s notice - more than on the soft science side of managing information and dealing with people,\u201d said mary gallagher, a political science professor who leads the university of michigan\u2019s center for chinese studies. city managers had little incentive to escalate problems to political superiors. the week in which no new virus cases were reported in hubei coincided with preparations for the lunar new year and sessions of the province\u2019s national \npeople\u2019s congress and the chinese people\u2019s political consultative conference. seven of the largest hospitals in wuhan are now equipped with testing kits for the virus, which in theory deliver results within a day, the hubei cdc official said. but four people told reuters they were refused tests because the process involved a complex reporting system including hospital, district and city health authorities and disease control officials. to qualify for the test, patients need to meet certain criteria, such as having symptoms of fever and pneumonia, and a surge in patients means it is \u201cimpossible to conduct the test right away,\u201d an official at the wuhan center for disease control and prevention told reuters. three hospital and local government workers, who have been briefed on how doctors are handling tests and confirming cases, told reuters that official numbers of infections and deaths do not reflect the actual toll. wuhan health authorities have a limit on tests, chiefly because of the shortage of testing kits, and are screening lists of patients before deciding who gets a test, which takes several hours, one hospital worker told reuters. \u201csome severely ill patients were left out from the final list for testing because they know they wouldn\u2019t be able to be treated,\u201d the worker told reuters. \u201cthe actual deaths were higher.\u201d reuters could not independently confirm the hospital worker\u2019s account. hubei and wuhan health authorities did not respond to reuters requests for comment. zhang, whose mother is still waiting for a test, said doctors at three wuhan hospitals told her family privately that they are almost certain she has contracted the coronavirus. however, he said two of those hospitals told him they are not equipped with testing kits, and the other told him it has no available bed to accommodate his mother for the test. none of those hospitals replied to reuters requests for comment. sixty-nine year-old xu enen, who has had fever and a lung infection since jan. \n8, was rejected by six hospitals in wuhan for testing as they said they had ran out of beds, his daughter told reuters. xu\u2019s symptoms have worsened lately, and he is starting to have breathing difficulties. he was finally admitted on jan. 22 to queue for the test at hankou hospital in wuhan after his daughter publicized his case on weibo. researchers at lancaster university estimate that only 5.1% of infections in wuhan have been identified. by jan. 21, they estimated a total of 11,341 people had been infected in wuhan since the start of the year. more than 30,000 people in wuhan are under observation, according to the city\u2019s health authorities. \u201call we want is to confirm the case is the virus or not,\u201d said a 33-year-old wuhan woman surnamed liu, whose father has been on a respirator in hospital since jan. 14 and was still untested on monday. \u201cat least if it\u2019s confirmed we have a direction. if there\u2019s no direction, there\u2019s no hope.\u201d "},

agency operating inside china, as part of a larger rollback of us-funded health and science experts on the ground there leading up to the coronavirus outbreak, reuters has learnt.   most of the reductions were made at the beijing office of the us centres for disease control and prevention (cdc) and occurred over the past two years, according to public cdc documents viewed by reuters and interviews with four people familiar with the drawdown.   the atlanta-based cdc, america's pre-eminent disease fighting agency, provides public health assistance to nations around the world and works with them to help stop outbreaks of contagious diseases from spreading globally. it has worked in china for 30 years.   the cdc's china headcount has shrunk to around 14 staff members, down from approximately 47 people since president donald trump took office in january 2017, the documents show. the four people, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the losses included epidemiologists and other health professionals.   the material reviewed by reuters shows a breakdown of how many american and local chinese employees were assigned there.   the documents are the cdc's own descriptions of its headcount, which it posts online. reuters was able to search past copies of the material to confirm the decline described by the four people.   \"the cdc office in beijing is a shell of its former self,\" said one of the people, a us official who worked in china at the time of the drawdown.   separately, the national science foundation (nsf) and the united states agency for international development (usaid), the global relief programme which had a role in helping china monitor and respond to outbreaks, also shut their beijing offices on mr trump's watch. before the closures, each office was staffed by a us official. in \naddition, the us department of agriculture (usda) transferred\u00a0the manager of an animal disease monitoring programme out of china in 2018.   reductions at the us agencies sidelined health experts, scientists and other professionals who might have been able to help china mount an earlier response to the novel coronavirus, as well as provide the us government with more information about what was coming, according to the people who spoke with reuters. the trump administration in february chastised china for censoring information about the outbreak and for keeping us experts from entering the country to assist.   \"we had a large operation of experts in china who were brought back during this administration, some of them months before the outbreak,\" said one of the people who witnessed the withdrawal of us personnel. \"you have to consider the possibility that our drawdown made this catastrophe more likely or more difficult to respond to.\"   the white house declined to comment or respond to questions from reuters regarding the us withdrawal of staff in china.   the cdc did not respond to detailed questions submitted by reuters about the cuts. it has insisted its staffing levels did not hinder the us response to the coronavirus.   \"there are many factors that go into decisions around staffing,\" the cdc said in a statement.   some health experts were sceptical that more cdc employees operating inside china would have made a difference in stemming the outbreak. beijing has been widely criticised for silencing its own public health officials who warned of a deadly new respiratory disease emanating from the chinese city of wuhan and surrounding hubei province.   \"the problem was china, not that we didn't have cdc people in china,\" said dr scott mcnabb, a former cdc epidemiologist who is now a research professor with emory university. he pointed to china's censorship as the main culprit in the spread of the pandemic, which has infected at least 435,470 people worldwide, killed \n19,598 and upended the global economy.   china's embassy in washington, dc declined to comment.   the nsf closed all foreign offices in 2018, according to spokesman robert margetta. he said the agency planned on \"sending teams on short-term expeditions around the world to find ways to increase international collaborations.\"   a usaid spokesman said the decision to shutter its beijing office was \"due to significantly decreased access to chinese government officials as well as the agency's position that the chinese model of development is not aligned with us values and interests\".   the usda confirmed that it moved a manager position out of beijing. a spokesman said the department has retained an office in china that employs eight people: five americans and three chinese. the office monitors animal disease and helps resolve \"trade-related issues as they occur at chinese ports of entry,\" the spokesman said.   reuters first reported about changes to cdc staffing in china on sunday. the news agency revealed that the trump administration had eliminated the position of a us trainer of chinese field epidemiologists, who were deployed to the epicentre of outbreaks to help track, investigate and contain diseases.   in a press briefing on sunday, mr trump criticised the reuters story as \"100 per cent wrong\". yet the cdc acknowledged the position had been cut. the agency said the decision was made because of china's \"excellent technical capability,\" and said the elimination of that post did not hamper the us effort to respond to the coronavirus outbreak.   the cdc staffing documents newly reviewed by reuters show a sharp decline in the overall number of employees at the agency in beijing, with 33 out of 47 positions lost.   the documents show the breakdown between american and chinese staff members. the number of so-called american \"assignees\" declined to three positions from eight at the outset of the administration. positions lost included medical epidemiologists and other \nexperts in infectious diseases.   the biggest cuts were to positions filled by chinese employees on the us payroll, down to around 10 from 40 over the same period. many of those local hires included medical and disease experts, according to the people who spoke with reuters.   \"local staffers stayed even longer at the cdc and had a real depth of knowledge,\" one of the people said. \"there's a loss of deep expertise and institutional knowledge.\"   the cdc told reuters the three americans currently on staff in china are a country director, an influenza expert and an information technology expert. a temporary deputy director arrived recently, and that job will be filled permanently, the agency said in a statement. in addition, two chinese staffers continue to work on specific public health areas, including the training programme, according to the statement.   the shuttered usaid and nsf offices in china also had a role in building scientific relationships and combating global disease, according to the four people familiar with the situation.   usaid's beijing office, which was staffed by a senior us officer and two chinese employees, was working on initiatives including multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and malaria, the people said. the office closed in 2019.   the nsf office was once led by dr nancy sung, a respected american scientist who was a key link between the us and chinese scientific communities, according to the us government official who spoke with reuters. the office also employed two local staff members.   \"she had far more contacts than most of us,\" said the official, who had been in china at the time and was familiar with her role. \"she could have helped maintain vital channels of communication between the two countries which to this day is greatly curtailed.\"   dr sung, who is now with the nsf in the united states, declined to comment about the closure of her office in 2018 and referred questions to the agency's public affairs office.   the changes came \namid escalating tensions between washington and beijing. mr trump has long complained that china has stolen millions of american jobs and intellectual property, charges the chinese government has rejected as baseless. the countries have slapped billions in tariffs on each other's goods. now their leaders are battling to control the narrative over the pandemic.   mr trump has called it the \"chinese virus\" to keep the focus on china's role in unleashing the pandemic. china, meanwhile, is trying to assert global leadership by providing aid to italy and other hard-hit countries.   over the last two years, the white house has pushed us agencies with a presence in china to de-fund programmes there along with the positions to manage them, according to the us official who spoke to reuters.   the source said mr terry branstad, the us ambassador to china and a former republican governor of iowa, tried to remind the white house of the importance of the us presence in china but was told to \"get with the programme\" by an administration official.   \"the white house saw the relationship as one-sided and without benefit to the us,\" the source said.   a state department spokesman said in a statement that the us embassy in china is \"one of our largest, reflecting the many areas of bilateral engagement\".   \"since ambassador branstad's arrival, the us mission to china has maintained robust staffing to advance important foreign policy goals on behalf of the american people,\" the statement said. \"staffing levels for the numerous federal agencies and sections have, on the whole, held steady and in some cases increased.\"   after reuters' story about the elimination of the key cdc position in china ran on sunday, mr trump's re-election campaign seized on it for fund raising. in a mass e-mail to supporters, it accused mr trump's critics of \"siding with the chinese\" and helping beijing with a \"cover-up\".   the cdc on monday told reuters that its director dr robert redfield had decided to add \na global health threats programme director to its china staff.   \"at the request of dr redfield, cdc is continuing to look long term at possible additions to enhance cdc's 30 plus year presence in china,\" the statement said.

controlling it. \"the chinese side pays close attention to the report of the emergence of one confirmed case of pneumonia caused by the novel \ncoronavirus in india, and will cooperate with the indian

prevention and control,\" ji said. india has already increased the number of airports from seven to 21 where thermal screening of passengers is being done for a possible exposure to the deadly ncov and issued travel advisory asking nationals to refrain from travelling to china. the centre has also stepped up vigil in areas bordering nepal in view of a confirmed case of ncov detected there. the union health minister has also written to all chief ministers, requesting them for personal intervention to review the states' preparedness for control and management of the spread of the virus. hundreds of people have been quarantined in hospitals, including over 800 in kerala, and are being monitored by doctors, according to ministry officials. three men kept under observation in an

pandemic in 2009.\u00a0   just hours earlier, the ministry of health (moh) had raised the disease outbreak response system condition (dorscon) risk assessment level from yellow to orange.   the dorscon level was raised after several covid-19 cases were detected in the republic without any links to previous cases or travel histories to china.\u00a0   \u201ci was shocked by what i saw on my phone. when i got home, i told my parents about it,\u201d mr tay, 31, said.   his mother had planned to do her weekly grocery run on saturday but he told her to do it that night as he \u201cwasn\u2019t sure if there would be anything left for her to buy in the morning at the rate people were wiping out the shelves\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0    customers at fairprice finest in bukit timah plaza on feb 7, 2020, after the dorscon alert level was changed to orange. photo: raj nadarajan/today   the mother and son then headed to their neighbourhood\u2019s mini-mart in choa chu kang.\u00a0   \u201cit was crazy that day. i\u2019ve never seen so many people inside before, and at such a late hour. there was a queue that wound around the inside of the store,\u201d said mr tay, who ended up having to wait for more than 30 minutes to pay for his purchases.\u00a0   his basket of groceries held a bag of rice, four packs of assorted \ninstant noodle flavours, a bottle of oil and several cans of tuna and sardine.   his 72-year-old mother, who helped carry two bags\u2019 worth of toilet paper, told him that she could not remember singaporeans panicking like this.   despite reassurances from government leaders including trade and industry minister chan chun sing who took to facebook to call for calm, mr tay and many singaporeans were not entirely assured as the panic buying continued through the night.   in fact, mr tay was still in the queue when he read mr chan\u2019s facebook post but he went on to complete his purchases.\u00a0   he told today that his actions were partly shaped by the mask situation. the government had made clear that it has a stockpile of masks but this did not prevent long queues or stocks running out at shops and pharmacies.\u00a0 \u00a0   what happened was that the government had released five million masks to retailers over nine days last month but these were sold out within hours. as a result, the government decided to distribute the masks from its stockpile directly to families, capped at four masks per household. at the same time, it has reiterated that there is no need for people to wear a mask if they are well and it is more important to practise good personal hygiene such as washing hands.\u00a0   singapore, like many countries, has been grappling with a mask shortage since the health crisis started, sparked by a sudden surge in demand.    the government has distributed masks from its stockpile directly to families, capped at four masks per household. photo: najeer yusof/today   while many like mr tay understood the constraints and logistical challenges involved, as far as they are concerned, the takeaway was that they had great difficulty getting masks from retailers and ultimately, had to rely on a limited number given out by the government.\u00a0   and even if supplies are in no danger of running out, mr tay argued that it would not hurt to be prepared.\u00a0   \u201canyway, if there\u2019s no emergency, we\u2019ll \njust take it as having done a few days\u2019 worth of shopping beforehand,\u201d he said.\u00a0   while mr tay and his mother had joined the hordes of shoppers at the supermarkets, their purchase was relatively\u00a0measured compared to the others: pictures of shoppers with overflowing trolleys went viral, along with photographs and videos of empty vegetable and fruit baskets, and chillers devoid of meat.\u00a0 \u00a0   still, some like dr paul tambyah felt it was understandable why these shoppers behaved the way they did.\u00a0   noting that singapore, along with the rest of the world, would have to deal with the outbreak for the next several months, dr tambyah \u2013 who is president of the asia-pacific society of clinical microbiology and infection \u2013 noted that in such a situation, it was practical to keep some essential supplies on standby in case one has to be put on quarantine, for instance.\u00a0\u00a0   \u201cas far as i know, when a quarantine officer comes to put a person on quarantine, they do not let you go shopping at the supermarket first,\u201d he said.   to allay public anxiety, prime minister lee hsien loong made a speech a day after the panic buying, assuring singaporeans that there was no need to panic as the city was not being locked down, and there was ample supply of food for everyone.\u00a0   now that a sense of normalcy has returned, questions remain to be answered: what caused all that panic-buying over that fateful weekend, which had left some quarters fuming \u2014 and embarrassed \u2014 over the behaviour of \u201cugly singaporeans\u201d, and others to question whatever happened to decades of efforts aimed at building a resilient society?   and what does it say about singaporeans, many of whom have stoically and quietly got on with their lives, despite the uncertainty and disruptions to daily life?\u00a0\u00a0   the situation elsewhere   as of friday, singapore has 67 confirmed cases of covid-19 \u2014 the highest outside of china where the vast majority of cases are concentrated.\u00a0   including hong kong and macau, china has reported \nalmost 64,000 cases to date and the count continues to rise.\u00a0   so far, apart from singapore, there have been no reports of panic buying in places outside of china.\u00a0 residents in thailand for example, which has 33 confirmed cases as of friday, told today that the situation was calm and there has been no run on daily essentials.\u00a0   some experts believe that events in hong kong, which was gripped by scenes of panic buying recently, had influenced singaporeans\u2019 behaviour.\u00a0   speaking to today, mr wong bai chun, a hong kong citizen, said that two weeks ago, there was a brief but acute shortage of toilet paper and other paper goods in the territory, which was sparked by an internet rumour that the chinese spring holiday was being extended and there would be insufficient supplies of such products.   mr wong said the fear over paper shortage had spread to other goods in hong kong. \u201cnow you can\u2019t find rice anywhere,\u201d said the 26-year-old who works in the finance industry.   unlike macau or mainland china, there are no regulations in hong kong to curb such behaviours, he added.   he said the panic buying and hoarding of daily essentials in hong kong stemmed from the shortage of disposable masks.\u00a0   \u201cat the moment, people are sourcing their masks from all over the world and there\u2019s simply not enough,\u201d he said. \u201chong kong doesn\u2019t have the capacity to manufacture sufficient amounts of them.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 mr wong bai chun, a hong kong citizen, told today that the city folks started hoarding long before singaporeans did. he said it all started with the shortage of disposable masks. photo: reuters   while the panic-buying in hong kong mirrors what happened in singapore, the similarity ends there.   for one, there is no risk of singapore running short of essential food and household items like toilet paper from short-term disruptions, such as the covid-19 outbreak, said minister for the environment and water resources masagos zulkifli.   the country has managed to be resilient due to astute \nplanning by the nation\u2019s food agencies and its well-connected transport network, he said on feb 10 during the launch of the 2020 singapore food story. the food security strategy aims to meet 30 per cent of the country\u2019s nutritional needs by 2030 using less than 1 per cent of its land area.\u00a0   on the evening of the panic buying in singapore, mr seah kian peng, who is the chief executive of supermarket cooperative ntuc fairprice, also assured the public that there were sufficient supplies of daily essentials in the warehouse.\u00a0   however, as experts pointed out, rationality and logic get cast aside\u00a0when panic sets in.   \u201cresearch suggests that when people are in panic, the thinking part of our brain gets hijacked by the emotional system and we start to act illogically,\u201d said a spokesperson for the singapore psychological society (sps) council. \u201cour ability to decide on our own is minimised.\u201d   other triggers   among the possible factors behind the panic buying was negativity bias where people\u2019s brains tend to focus more on negative information than positive ones, said the sps spokesperson.   \u201cour brains are hardwired to register negative stimuli more readily and also to dwell and worry on them for a longer period of time,\u201d the spokesperson told today.   furthermore, whenever there is a life-threatening epidemic or emergency, the notions of safety, protection, and self-preservation usually come into play.\u00a0   the spokesperson also noted people also tend to follow others in the hope that the latter could get them out of a dangerous situation.\u00a0   in singapore\u2019s case, this could be a possible reason why people started to hoard or buy things impulsively if everyone else around them was doing the same, or if they were told to do so on social media platforms.   this phenomenon of groupthink results in irrational and dysfunctional thinking and outcomes.\u00a0   \u201cin this case, our brains focus more on the fear generated rather than on the reassurance given,\u201d said the spokesperson. \nmr lars voedisch, the managing director of public relations firm precious communications, said that such behaviour is triggered by one or two initial incidents which then get amplified by social media.   \u201c(this leads) to a snowball effect of more and more people thinking of it, then hearing from the first people acting on their fear, sharing about it and through that fuelling the whole panic,\u201d he said.   the images of empty shelves circulating on social media played a big part, said singapore management university sociologist paulin straughan. \u00a0 \u201cthis meant that people were no longer reacting to rumours that essentials might run out, but this new development itself,\u201d she said. \u201cwhich is: the shelves are empty. better start to go now.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0    shoppers at fairprice finest in bukit timah plaza reaching out for toilet paper even before it got stocked in the shelves. photo: raj nadarajan/today   professor straughan, whose research interests include medical sociology that encompasses infectious diseases, said it did not help that the public was seeing these images circulated on social media late in the night. as a result, these became the abiding images for many singaporeans overnight.\u00a0   \u201cfor the next 12 hours, the shelves remain empty (in their minds),\u201d she said. \u201cand that\u2019s 12 hours of festering, and it entrenches (the fear that there are no supplies).\u201d   agreeing with mr voedisch\u2019s observation about social media, prof straughan reiterated that while technology has helped to disseminate information a lot faster, it has similarly allowed misinformation to spread just as quickly as well.   this was not something that singaporeans had to worry about during the past virus outbreaks, she added.   the sps council spokesperson noted that when the covid-19 virus was first made known, there was an overwhelming amount of news and social media coverage.   \u201cwhen the dorscon orange was finally announced, it became a trigger tantamount to saying \u2018the coronavirus has arrived\u2019, \nresulting in the accompanying hoarding behaviour as response,\u201d the spokesperson said.\u00a0   nanyang technological university (ntu)\u00a0professor may oo lwin, whose research interest at the wee kim wee school of communication and information (wkwsci) includes strategic and health communications, said it is likely that the public was responding to certain levels of fear and stress that the deluge of messages had aroused.\u00a0\u00a0   she explained that scientists have pointed to a phenomenon where communication leading to fear and stressful emotions can cause unintended consequences.\u00a0\u00a0   such messages, she said, needed to be concurrently countered with provision of strategies for coping with perceived threats.\u00a0\u00a0   \u201cin this particular case, all the media information is likely to have induced strong emotive elements which were managed by some population segments by embracing these forms of rational or irrational, but culturally symbolic, behaviours,\u201d said prof lwin.   in other words, some segments of the population \u201cmay undertake actions based around daily priorities to respond to their perceptions of the threat\u201d, said the health communications expert.\u00a0for example, in extreme cases of crisis like an earthquake, people could be seen taking their television sets while evacuating, she noted.\u00a0   that could explain why stacks of toilet paper were snapped up by singaporeans during the panic buying.\u00a0prof straughan had another theory: they were relatively cheap and easy to hoard. \u201cwe all want to do something to make ourselves feel better,\u201d she quipped.   public comms \u2018could have been better\u2019\u00a0   communications experts told today that the panic-buying in singapore might have been avoided if the information disseminated by the authorities had been clearer.\u00a0   \u201cthe problem with the message was that it was too bureaucratic at the start,\u201d said assistant professor liew kai khiun,\u00a0who teaches at ntu's wkwsci. \u201cmuch of the government\u2019s message involved military terms (and) colour codes.\"   prof \nstraughan agreed, noting that the definition of dorscon orange was not explained enough as well.   dorscon is a colour-coded framework that shows the current disease situation.\u00a0   orange refers to a situation in which a virus is spreading in singapore but not widely, and is being contained. previously, the risk assessment level was at yellow, signifying that the virus was severe and could infect from person to person, but was chiefly occurring outside singapore. the highest level, red, indicates that the virus is spreading widely and can result in major disruption such as closing schools.   \u201csome people didn\u2019t know what it meant. all they saw was the visual,\u201d said prof straughan. \u201cthere are four levels. green, yellow, orange and red. red is bad, everybody knows that right? green is good. now orange. it is closer to red than it is to green. so visually, it lights up all your flags.\u201d\u00a0   asst prof liew pointed out while the message from the authorities was accurate, it did not cater to the layman. to that end, they could have used dialect or singlish to reach out more effectively, he noted.\u00a0   during the sars outbreak in 2003, local sitcom character phua chu kang was used to educate singaporeans on the importance of washing their hands.\u00a0 this, he said, was an effective way of reaching out to the public, and many people still remember it today.   a leaked moh press release a few hours before the official dorscon orange announcement, which left many befuddled, might have also fuelled the public panic.\u00a0   the press release was circulated on social media and through messaging platforms such as whatsapp.   up till this incident, prof straughan felt that the government had been doing well in being upfront with singaporeans about the virus situation. but when the press release was prematurely leaked out, it created some confusion.\u00a0   she said it did not help that recipients of the leaked document were initially told by others that it was fake news, only to be informed by the \nauthorities a few hours later that it was indeed true.\u00a0\u00a0   such contradictory information would have led some to question if the authorities were trying to hide something, she said.\u00a0   the authorities have yet to announce the source of the leak, but trade and industry minister chan said on feb 9 that the various agencies involved in tackling the virus will remind their staff that they have a professional responsibility not to prematurely share information that has not been finalised.   despite these short-comings in public communications,\u00a0some\u00a0experts\u00a0felt that prime minister lee\u2019s nine-minute long speech on feb 8 went some way in restoring a sense of normalcy.   the sps council spokesperson said mr lee\u2019s message gave people very concrete actions that \u201chanded back a measure of control to people whose sense of control felt threatened\u201d.   mr voedisch of precious communications said having the prime minister step in to address the public helped, because it went beyond technocratic statements and directly addressed what people were concerned with.   \u201cwhile authorities should not get emotional when communicating, they have to be empathetic appealing to the hearts and minds of the audience,\u201d said mr voedisch.   however, he was uncertain if an address by mr lee to the public at an earlier juncture would have helped.\u00a0   instead, he said that the authorities should have foreseen the responses from the public as part of proper scenario planning with \u201cready-to-go action plans\u201d.   also, they should have anticipated and addressed the public\u2019s concerns and fears across the different platforms, he added.\u00a0   the ramifications\u00a0   mr chan, the trade and industry minister, had spoken out against panic buying and hoarding behaviour by a \u201csmall segment of singaporeans\u201d, even though he noted that this was to be expected.\u00a0   in a facebook post on feb 8, he noted that it was \u201cnatural\u201d in times of uncertainty that people want to protect themselves and the ones that they love.\u00a0   \u201chowever i \nurge all of us to think of the larger communities we belong to. hoarding means that we deprive others of things that they really need,\u201d he said. \u201cthat could be your neighbour who needs to buy rice for her children\u2019s meals or even organisations looking after the vulnerable who require cleaning supplies.\u201d   speaking to the media the next day, mr chan also said that the panic buying at supermarkets will signal to other countries that singaporeans cannot react well in times of crisis and could be taken advantage of in the future.   one potential consequence, he warned, is that suppliers and retailers who observe the panic buying might take advantage of the situation and jack up prices of goods.   ultimately, the hoarding behaviour was \u201ca fight-or-flight response that has arisen primarily from fear and a need for self-preservation\u201d, said the sps council spokesperson.   and this fear can breed distrust and hostility towards others. \u201cwith a constant overemphasis on fear, people may start to behave in less caring or more complacent ways in order to maintain self-preservation,\u201d the spokesperson added.\u00a0\u00a0   here comes the good   still, despite the panic buying grabbing the headlines, mr chan and other government leaders took pains to point out that a large majority of singaporeans had been \u201ccalm and rational\u201d.\u00a0   many singaporeans had come forward to thank the cashiers and supermarket staff constantly working behind the scenes to restock the empty shelves, mr chan noted.\u00a0\u00a0   countless others have also stepped in to do their part for their fellow citizens, with numerous ground-up initiatives started in the community.   for example, today had reported about two primary school girls who used their pocket money to buy and deliver breakfast to doctors and nurses. on valentine\u2019s day which fell on friday, community group standupforsg also gave out \u201clove letters\u201d to frontline healthcare workers.

ordinary singaporeans have got on with their lives, despite the disruptions and worries brought on by the covid-19 outbreak.\u00a0   scores of singaporeans \u2014 such as taxi and private-hire drivers, as well as those in the retail and tourism industries \u2014 have seen their livelihoods take\u00a0a hit. others have had to adjust to working from home as business continuity plans swung into place.   cleaners, for example, are putting in longer hours while healthcare workers not only have to work longer each day but are also putting themselves at risk on the frontlines.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0   a 23-year-old outbreak nurse who works with covid-19 patients said that while her family understands the risks of her occupation, it does not stop them from worrying.\u00a0   \u201cmost nurses are worried too, but it\u2019s our job and this is what we do for a living,\u201d said the nurse, who wanted to be known only as sharmaine due to the sensitivity of her role.   when she was first assigned to handle suspected covid-19 cases, sharmaine said she was scared as no one knew what exactly they were dealing with.\u00a0   \u201cbut over time, i grew immune to it, even if a patient were to test positive for the virus. now i don't feel so scared anymore.\u201d   however, she feels disappointed at the discrimination against healthcare workers shown by some singaporeans, even as many others expressed gratitude for their work.\u00a0 \u201cit truly is demoralising when you hear of such incidents. we feel ostracised at times because all we want to do is perform our job and go home,\u201d she said. \u201cbut we continue to keep an open mind because we are the first line of defence.\u201d      messages from the public thanking healthcare workers for their hard work. these messages were put up on facebook with the hashtag #braveheartsg, in response to the initiative by community group standupforsg. photo: facebook/muru nagaraju, jocelyn chng, jj huang, dawn yip   a taxi driver, \nwho wanted to be known as mr ahmad, said he is not scared and has no qualms about picking up healthcare workers.\u00a0\u00a0   although his wife worries for him, as there is no way of knowing whether a passenger might be infected with the virus, the 56-year-old citycab driver said he still has to continue driving to support his family.\u00a0\u00a0   the virus outbreak, he added, had drastically affected his earnings lately, though he declined to reveal by how much.   \u201cso far, even my friends (who are also taxi drivers) have all been continuing to work as per normal,\u201d said mr ahmad.\u00a0   the only difference is that he has taken some precautions, such as winding down the windows to air his vehicle after dropping off each passenger and disinfecting his steering wheel with dettol, he added.\u00a0   for 37-year-old father lucas chiam, he sought to turn the situation around by using it as an opportunity to spend more time with his two sons, aged six and four.   due to covid-19, the lecturer and his wife decided to limit their children\u2019s outings to the parks and playgrounds, where they would typically just keep an eye out for the youngsters\u2019 safety.   instead, they introduced the boys to home-based activities which could involve the entire family, such as arts and craft, reading and even playing xbox console games.\u00a0   \u201ci think the best we can do right now is to stay positive. this is an opportunity to bond with the kids, work on some home improvement tasks and plan for the year ahead,\u201d mr chiam said.\u00a0   \u201cmaybe through these tough times, we can develop some new good habits for the family that will stay with us even after the threat is over.\u201d   some businesses have had to adjust their operating models due to the outbreak.   ms jazz chong, the owner and director of contemporary gallery ode to art, has noticed fewer people visiting the gallery as well as the raffles city shopping centre, where the gallery is located.\u00a0\u00a0   \u201cwith the virus outbreak becoming more severe, we have now decided to take the \nextra measure of bringing the art to our clients directly,\u201d she said. \u201cif they like the work then it can remain in their home, making it extra convenient for them as they do not even have to leave their house.\u201d   meanwhile, curtain maker and supplier mc2 held its first facebook live event on feb 11.   mr wilson chew, the founder and managing director of the company, said: \u201cduring this time of crisis when people may be worried about attending events with crowds, we thought of using facebook live.\u201d   by broadcasting live on the social media platform, customers were given the chance to ask questions and interact with the company\u2019s salesperson in real time as he gave demonstrations of the company\u2019s various zip-blind products.\u00a0   business owners like ms chong and mr chew are hoping that people would continue life as normal, albeit taking the necessary precautions.\u00a0   or as ntu\u2019s asst prof liew put it: \u201cwe must have a courageous sense of normality and go on living life normally.\u201d\u00a0   indeed, prime minister lee noted on friday that the covid-19 outbreak is expected to last longer than sars, with a greater impact already hitting the economy. \u00a0 but he stressed: \u201cwe have to keep singapore going and we have to keep making a living. life has to go on.\u201d "}, {"content": "Scientists believe that they discovered the mortal virus that has already

chinese city of wuhan two weeks after she started to show signs of a fever, even though doctors privately told her family that she almost certainly has been infected, her son zhang changchun told reuters. yang, 53, is just one of many wuhan inhabitants finding it difficult to get tested or receive treatment for the new form of coronavirus, which authorities say has infected 2,800 people and killed at least 80 in china, a situation that may be contributing to the spread of the disease. yang has been unable to gain full-time admission to a hospital, her son said. she has been put on drips in unquarantined areas at four separate hospitals in the city to treat her deteriorating lungs, he said, while he is doing what he can to get her tested or admitted full-time. \u201cmy brother and i have been queuing at the hospital every day. we go at 6 and 7 in the morning, and queue for the whole day, but we don\u2019t get any new answers,\u201d zhang told reuters. \u201cevery time the responses are the same: \u2018there\u2019s no bed, wait for the government to give a notice, and follow the news to see what\u2019s going on.\u2019 the doctors are all very frustrated too.\u201d officially known as 2019-ncov, the new form of coronavirus was first identified as the cause of death of a 61-year-old man in wuhan on jan. 10, when china shared gene information on the virus with other countries. some, such as japan and thailand, started testing travelers from china for the virus within three days. however, testing kits for the disease were not distributed to some of wuhan\u2019s hospitals until about jan. 20, an official at the hubei provincial center for disease control and prevention (hubei cdc) told reuters. before then, samples had to be sent to a laboratory in beijing for testing, a process that took three to five days to get results, according to wuhan \nhealth authorities. during that gap, hospitals in the city reduced the number of people under medical observation from 739 to just 82, according to data compiled by reuters from wuhan health authorities, and no new cases were reported inside china. despite the lack of reliable data and testing capacity in wuhan, chinese authorities assured citizens in the days after the virus had been identified that it was not widely transmissible. in previous weeks, it had censored negative online commentary about the situation, and arrested eight people it accused of being \u201crumor spreaders.\u201d \u201cthe doctor didn\u2019t wear a mask, we didn\u2019t know how to protect ourselves... no one told us anything,\u201d a 45-year-old woman surnamed chen told reuters. her aunt was confirmed to have the virus on jan. 20, five days after she was hospitalized. \u201ci posted my aunt\u2019s photos on (chinese social media site) weibo and the police called the hospital authorities. they told me to take it down.\u201d national, regional and city health officials did not respond to requests for comment from reuters on how the virus outbreak has been handled. national officials did say at a media briefing last week that there were some \u201cloopholes\u201d in initial treatment methods. wuhan\u2019s mayor, zhou xianwang, told chinese state television on monday he recognized that \u201call parties were not satisfied with the disclosure of our information.\u201d but he pointed to strictures placed upon him by provincial and national leaders. \u201cin local governance, after i receive information, i can only release it when i\u2019m authorized,\u201d he said. zhou told a media briefing on sunday that a further 1,000 people could be diagnosed with the virus in wuhan, based on the number of patients yet to be tested. china last week locked down the affected region in hubei province in the biggest quarantine operation on record and is building two new hospitals to treat virus patients. president xi jinping has created a special committee to tackle the outbreak. the country has \nbeen praised internationally for quickly sequencing the virus gene. however, its slow scale-up of testing has been questioned. once a virus has been identified, \u201cyou need to make sure you have all the reagent (a substance used in chemical analysis) samples and you\u2019ve got it all pushed out to where you want to do testing,\u201d said amesh adalja, a senior scholar at the johns hopkins university center for health security, who focuses on emerging infectious disease and pandemic preparedness. although information from the region is scarce, adalja suggested china has had problems with this stage of tackling the outbreak. \u201cwe\u2019re already hearing that there are shortages of medical professionals there, that there are shortages of test kits and medicines,\u201d he said. john edmunds, a professor at the center for mathematical modeling of infectious diseases at the london school of hygiene & tropical medicine, said china has not communicated enough detailed data after the initial outbreak. \u201cwe have a very incomplete picture of what\u2019s going on,\u201d he told reuters. \u201cwhether it\u2019s incompetence, secrecy, or deliberate, i don\u2019t know, but it would be very useful if we could have some basic epidemiological data.\u201d the shortage of testing supplies and china\u2019s initial reticence have drawn criticism that the country is still learning lessons from the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) in 2002 that killed almost 800 people. \u201cthe improvements have been on the hard science side - figuring out the virus\u2019s genome, building new hospitals at a moment\u2019s notice - more than on the soft science side of managing information and dealing with people,\u201d said mary gallagher, a political science professor who leads the university of michigan\u2019s center for chinese studies. city managers had little incentive to escalate problems to political superiors. the week in which no new virus cases were reported in hubei coincided with preparations for the lunar new year and sessions of the province\u2019s national \npeople\u2019s congress and the chinese people\u2019s political consultative conference. seven of the largest hospitals in wuhan are now equipped with testing kits for the virus, which in theory deliver results within a day, the hubei cdc official said. but four people told reuters they were refused tests because the process involved a complex reporting system including hospital, district and city health authorities and disease control officials. to qualify for the test, patients need to meet certain criteria, such as having symptoms of fever and pneumonia, and a surge in patients means it is \u201cimpossible to conduct the test right away,\u201d an official at the wuhan center for disease control and prevention told reuters. three hospital and local government workers, who have been briefed on how doctors are handling tests and confirming cases, told reuters that official numbers of infections and deaths do not reflect the actual toll. wuhan health authorities have a limit on tests, chiefly because of the shortage of testing kits, and are screening lists of patients before deciding who gets a test, which takes several hours, one hospital worker told reuters. \u201csome severely ill patients were left out from the final list for testing because they know they wouldn\u2019t be able to be treated,\u201d the worker told reuters. \u201cthe actual deaths were higher.\u201d reuters could not independently confirm the hospital worker\u2019s account. hubei and wuhan health authorities did not respond to reuters requests for comment. zhang, whose mother is still waiting for a test, said doctors at three wuhan hospitals told her family privately that they are almost certain she has contracted the coronavirus. however, he said two of those hospitals told him they are not equipped with testing kits, and the other told him it has no available bed to accommodate his mother for the test. none of those hospitals replied to reuters requests for comment. sixty-nine year-old xu enen, who has had fever and a lung infection since jan. \n8, was rejected by six hospitals in wuhan for testing as they said they had ran out of beds, his daughter told reuters. xu\u2019s symptoms have worsened lately, and he is starting to have breathing difficulties. he was finally admitted on jan. 22 to queue for the test at hankou hospital in wuhan after his daughter publicized his case on weibo. researchers at lancaster university estimate that only 5.1% of infections in wuhan have been identified. by jan. 21, they estimated a total of 11,341 people had been infected in wuhan since the start of the year. more than 30,000 people in wuhan are under observation, according to the city\u2019s health authorities. \u201call we want is to confirm the case is the virus or not,\u201d said a 33-year-old wuhan woman surnamed liu, whose father has been on a respirator in hospital since jan. 14 and was still untested on monday. \u201cat least if it\u2019s confirmed we have a direction. if there\u2019s no direction, there\u2019s no

"}, {"content": "china scrambles to curb rise in imported coronavirus cases, wuhan eases lockdown. china reported 46 new coronavirus cases on sunday, while the city of wuhan, the pandemic's ground zero, announced it would be loosening a two-month lockdown by gradually resuming public transportation and allowing healthy people to resume work. it was the fourth day in a row with an increase in chinese cases, all but one of which was imported from overseas. but in a sign of easing lockdown measures, residents living in and outside wuhan will be allowed to travel into the city to resume work if they have a green health code issued by the government and normal body temperature, state-media cctv news reported on sunday. it cited the city's epidemic prevention and control command center. non-local people stranded in wuhan can also apply to leave the city after taking an rna test and receiving a health certificate from the government, the channel said. despite the relaxed measures for wuhan and a reduced number of domestically transmitted cases - the one reported on sunday was the first in four days - china is seeing a steady rise in imported cases, mostly chinese people returning from overseas. that has led beijing to further step up measures to intercept cases from abroad as the outbreak worsens globally. in a sign of how seriously china is taking the threat of imported cases, all international flights due to arrive in beijing starting monday will first land at another airport, where passengers will undergo virus screening, government agencies said on sunday, in an expansion of existing measures. international flights that were scheduled to arrive in the capital will land instead at one of 12 airports. passengers who clear screening will then be permitted to reboard the plane, which will then fly to beijing, the regulator said. separately, shanghai and guangzhou both announced that all arriving international passengers will undergo an rna test to screen for coronavirus, expanding a \nprogram that previously only applied to those coming from heavily-hit countries. among the new cases from abroad reported on sunday, a record 14 were in the financial hub of shanghai and 13 were in beijing, a decline from 21 the previous day. the new locally transmitted case was in the southern metropolis of guangzhou and was also the first known case where the infection of a local person was linked to the arrival of someone from overseas, according to guangdong province. hu xijin, the editor-in-chief of the global times newspaper, called for all cities in china to implement 14-day quarantines for people arriving from abroad. he also called for quarantine policies to apply to people from hong kong and macau as well, he said on his weibo account on sunday. \"i am worried that there are similar cases to the guangzhou one existing in other parts of the country. there were reports previously that people coming back from abroad returned to their homes in shanghai without any obstacles,\" hu said. \"it matters to the overall situation of china's next prevention and control efforts if we can plug the leaks.\" the global times is a tabloid published by the ruling communist party's people's daily. the latest figures from china's national health commission bring total reported coronavirus cases in the country to 81,054, with 3,261 deaths, including six on saturday. on saturday, china reported 41 new coronavirus cases for the previous day, all of them imported. of all 97 imported cases as of end-saturday, 92 of them are chinese nationals and 51 are chinese students returning from studying abroad, said gao xiaojun, spokesman for the beijing municipal health commission during a press conference on sunday. the beijing health commission announced separately on its website it had two more imported cases on sunday, bringing the city's total number of imported cases to 99 as of sunday noon. back to a kind of normal china is trying to revive an economy that is widely expected to contract \ndeeply in the current quarter, with life slowly returning to normal in cities such as beijing and shanghai, albeit with everyone wearing masks in public. still, numerous shops and restaurants remain shut - many have gone out of business - and factories and other workplaces are still not operating at full capacity. on sunday, a central bank official called for stepped-up global policy coordination to manage the economic impact of the pandemic. he said china's recent policy measures were gaining traction, and it has capacity for further action. chen yulu, a deputy governor at the people's bank of china (pboc), also said he expects significant improvement in the chinese economy in the second quarter. and while the virus will continue putting upward pressure on near-term consumer prices, there is no basis for long-term inflation or deflation, he told a news briefing. globally, roughly 275,000 people have been infected with the virus, and more than 11,000 have died, according to a reuters tally, with the number of deaths in italy recently surpassing those in china. \"now i think the epidemic has been controlled. but this definitely doesn't mean that it's over,\" said a 25-year-old woman surnamed he who works in the internet sector and was visiting the vast summer palace complex in beijing on saturday. \"i'm willing to come out today but of course i am still afraid,\" she told reuters. the central province of hubei, where the outbreak first emerged late last year in its capital wuhan, reported its fourth straight day of no new cases. china has used draconian measures to contain the spread of the virus, including locking down hubei province. "}, {"content": "Hospitals not well prepared according to the Federal Medical Association. The Federal Medical Association does not praise the hospitals in Germany sufficiently for the novel coronavirus. Optimal for patients with this virus are single rooms with pre-infections, but of which it no longer gives birth, said the pandemic supervisor of the chamber, Susanne Johna, the new Osnabr\u00fccker Zeitung. The number of these rooms was reduced for cost reasons last decade. Johna said that so-called single boxes would need so-called individual boxes in intensive care units to minimize the risk of transmission. Also, there are too few for cost reasons. The hygiene expert, which is also chairman of the Medical Union Marburger Confederation, designated the new virus from China as a wake-up call. Not only at the hospital equipment there will be catching up. The public health service is also \"massively understaffed\" in many places. It defects doctors and specialists. Johna warned but panic. Although the new virus had to be taken seriously, \"because we do not know everything for a long time\". But there is no current threat. The danger of normal flu is much higher. An influenza in Germany had already died in this winter about 40 people. But the flu known is known \"and is not as seriously taken as a new pathogen with many unknowns\". In Germany, a fifth case of infection was confirmed with the new virus on Thursday evening. As with the other four German cases, it is an employee of the automotive supplier Webasto, which was established in the Upper Bavarian Starnberg, as the Bavarian Ministry of Health. At the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities of the World Health Organization WHO reported an accumulation of pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause in the Central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel \nVirus as the cause of the diseases. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days then a group released a group of the virologen Christian's premier from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 the first diagnostic test for the new virus, the researcher provisionally call 2019-NCOV. With the test, the virus can be detected in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, on which, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected. Both the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as well as Mers (MIDDLE East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses which have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more than 750 died. With the MERS virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronaviruses. Many of them relate to respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example. In China, several thousand persons are suffering from them, some of them - most of them with pre-existing conditions - have died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first infection cases outside of China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been in Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection with a tourist, who came back from Wuhan, on January 24, the first cases were known in France. Meanwhile, first cases were confirmed in Germany. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. The virus can cause pneumonia that can endally end. Since it is a viral illness, antibiotics do not help. Meanwhile, it is clear that the virus of humans too \nMan can be transferred. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transfers after a dozen cases were known in medical staff. Medizors assume that the virus is transmitted above all over droplet infection. The World Health Organization calculates, as announced on January 24, at the moment that an infected one cuts 1.4 to 2.5 other people. Contest these numbers, the virus is less contagious than SARS and also the viral flu. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals. That can not be said yet. The World Health Organization said on 28 January that about one-fifth of the reported cases through the virus will be seriously ill, so in case of doubt must be treated intensive care. According to reports, the first death pots were patients who had some severe pre-existing conditions. Even with other infectious diseases, people with pre-existing diseases are particularly endangered - for example at the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so change their genome. This can cause you to become more dangerous for people in the course of an outbreak - but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) expects no similar mortality to the current time as the outbreak of SARS. Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU) stressed that Germany was well prepared for the virus. In an interview with the magazine Focus he said, the Federal Government had taken measures to identify suspected cases early and thus minimize the risk of contagion. Spahn said he did not hold the novel respiratory disease for an emergency in Germany: \"We are very alert. But left.\" In China, infections rose and \nDeaths by the coronavirus continue. The number of patients grew by 1,981 to now 9,692, as the health commission reported in Beijing. The number of dead rose by 42 to 213. The World Health Organization (WHO) had previously explained the spread of the virus to a \"health requirement of international scope\". The 190 member countries will thus coordinate crisis measures recommended by the WHO. Because of the virus, the US State Department issued a travel warning for the whole of China. The Foreign Office in Berlin was initially warned before traveling in the most affected province Hubei, but recommended in a subscript warning, not necessary trips to China \"if possible\".

working in the country for many years. for pietermaritzburg sisters mriska (29) and 21-year-old mischa singh, both university of kwazulu-natal graduates who have been teaching english there, the trip back home was not an easy path. glad that they are finally home, mriska, who was teaching english in beijing, said when they first found out about the virus and its effects, in the middle of january, it was not taken as a serious issue. \u201ceveryone just thought it was something that would blow over and we were too far away to be directly affected. but as the virus spread, the government clamped down on everything and the city became a ghost town,\u201d she said. overnight the chinese capital, like other cities across the country, became deserted after imposing restrictions and shut down public spaces. although beijing is not under a strict government-ordered lockdown, like in wuhan \u2014 which is the \u201cepicentre\u201d of the virus outbreak \u2014 it has, however, imposed restrictions on every aspect of life since declaring the highest level of public health emergency on january\u200924. this shutdown across most of china has caused the country and, to an extent, its economy to grind to a halt. \u201cwe were fine for about a week after the restrictions were imposed and then we started seeing the impact of it. we were not allowed out of our apartments. in any case we did not want to leave for fear of becoming infected. \u201ceach person entering or leaving the apartment had to provide details of where they were going to and who they have been in contact with. most of the businesses, schools, shops and everything else is closed. \u201cwater was the first commodity to run out as stocks are not being replenished and then it was food items,\u201d said mriska. for the chinese, the december and january period is heralded as the spring festival and many use \nthat time to splurge on travel and vacations. mischa, who lives and teaches in yanjaio in the hebei province, just outside beijing, was at disneyland in shanghai and woke up to overnight news that the city was on lockdown as a result of the virus. \u201ci just packed my bags and headed for the airport. i didn\u2019t want to be stranded in a hotel in shanghai. the airport was an absolute mess but i eventually managed to get a flight to beijing, where i spent a few days with my sister before heading back,\u201d said mischa. but that was nothing compared to what she would find when she returned to yanjaio and then tried to leave there again. \u201cwhen i got back, it was already a ghost town. there was not a soul to be seen. we couldn\u2019t even get masks. because it is a smaller village, people were very scared. soon there was no food and water,\u201d said mischa. at the same time, the sisters were arranging to return to south africa. \u201cwe couldn\u2019t go to work as everything was shut down and we were also growing scared that if we delayed we would not be able to leave as most airlines were clamping down on their flights out of china,\u201d said mriska. when they eventually made their arrangements, it was another battle to get mischa from yanjaio to beijing. \u201cthe subways were not running and neither were there any taxis available as people were not taking chances and coming out of their homes. i had to call a chinese friend, who knew another person who drove a taxi, and after three attempts got a taxi to come to beijing. i just had to try anyway i could to get to beijing to my sister so we could fly out,\u201d said mischa. \u201ci eventually managed to get a taxi but the journey to beijing was long and difficult. it\u2019s normally a 45-minute trip for the 36\u2009km, but the border posts were busy and the authorities had to stop each car and check on each person. \u201cevery person had to have their temperatures checked and sign forms indicating where they were from and where they were going to.\u201d at the same time, as news of the \ndeaths from the virus spread, fear-mongering grew. \u201cmy chinese friend returned from vacation to find she had nowhere to live. her flatmates had changed the password on the access system and locked her out as she had been travelling and they were not prepared to take the risk,\u201d said mriska. eventually leaving china on february\u20093, the sisters flew to dubai and then arrived in south africa on february\u20097. \u201cwe booked our flights and kept monitoring to see that it wasn\u2019t cancelled as most airlines were cancelling their flights. we were lucky. \u201cwe arrived at the airport six hours ahead of our flight to make sure everything would run smoothly only to find horrendous queues and thousands of people from all over the world also trying to get out of china while they could. \u201ceveryone was wearing masks, and even on the flights we had to keep it on,\u201d said mischa. landing with masks on in dubai, she said, was pretty awkward, as other travellers distanced themselves from them and gave them strange looks because it was evident they were from china because of the masks. \u201cat dubai and in south africa, upon landing we were subjected to temperature checks and had to fill in forms advising where we had been travelling from and if we were ill,\u201d said mischa. glad that they are back home, the sisters said they were thankful to be away from the outbreak. \u201cwe have work commitments and will have to go back once all of this is over. but we are just glad to be home, to have drinking water and food, fresh air and be safe,\u201d said mriska. their parents, kamal and jasmin singh, were due to fly to china on february\u20097 to visit their daughters but had to cancel their trip as well. \u201cwe were stressed out and encouraged the girls to come home. we are just glad that they got here in time and that they are safe,\u201d said jasmin. \u2018suffering and sadness around\u2019 veteran kzn journalist martin challenor, who lives in yinzhou

other cities are subjected to 14 days quarantine. these measures are needed because the virus spreads so easily and because a person can spread the virus for 14 days after catching it and before falling ill themselves. i am growing weaker through inactivity. there is so much suffering and sadness around me,\u201d reads his post. recommended safety measures although there are no reported cases of the coronavirus in south africa, practising recommended measures advised by the world health organisation will help in the long-term. \u2022 wash your hands frequently with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand rub if your hands are not visibly dirty. why? washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub eliminates the virus if it is on your hands. \u2022 practice respiratory hygiene when coughing and sneezing, cover mouth and nose with flexed elbow or tissue \u2014 discard tissue immediately into a closed bin and clean your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. why? covering your mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing prevent the spread of germs and viruses. if you sneeze or cough into your hands, you may contaminate objects or people that you touch. \u2022 maintain social distancing maintain at least a one-metre distance between yourself and other people, particularly those who are coughing, sneezing \nand have a fever. why? when someone who is infected with a respiratory disease like 2019-ncov coughs or sneezes, they project small droplets containing the virus. if you are too close, you can breathe in the virus. \u2022 avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth why? hands touch many surfaces which can be contaminated with the virus. if you touch your eyes, nose or mouth with your contaminated hands, you can transfer the virus from the surface to yourself. \u2022 if you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early tell your health care provider if you have travelled in an area in china where

a seattle resident in his 30s - is in good condition, american officials said.   the chinese government has classified the outbreak in the same category as the sars epidemic, meaning compulsory isolation for those diagnosed with the illness and the potential to implement quarantine measures.      but they still have not been able \nto confirm the exact source of the virus, which has infected at least 440 people across the country.   \"we will step up research efforts to identify the source and transmission of the disease,\" li said, although he said experts believe \"the cases are mostly linked to wuhan\".      countries have been intensifying efforts to stop the spread of the pathogen -

Franka Lu is a Chinese journalist and entrepreneur. She works in China and Germany. In this time-online series, she reports critical about life, culture and everyday life in China.

At Berlin S-Bahn station Busselstra\u00dfe, a Chinese student of two women has been insulted and kicked. In Toronto, an old lady from Hong Kong was insulted in a supermarket. In France, the newspaper Courrier Picard Hetzerisch called \"Alerte Jaune\" (\"Alert Yellow\") and \"Le P\u00e9ril Jaune?\" (\"Yellow danger?\"), For this purpose, the picture of a Chinese woman was shown with protective mask (the newspaper has now apologized for her wording of readers).

People with Chinese roots are experiencing directly in Germany. Worldwide, incidents that are directed against Asian-looking people, to an old lesson: fear and ignorance people can become hostile overnight to others who belong to a particular group, ethnicity, nation belonging. Seals divide us people. Albert Camus tells of the Pest, Jos\u00e9 Saramago in the city of Blinden. This is nothing new, it will certainly happen again in the future, everywhere, where people live. The more one mentions of a catastrophe threatened, the stronger fear and stupidity will determine human behavior and lead to violence and cruelty. One can call renewable hostility against Chinese and Chinese racism, but the phenomenon is not limited to the West. In China, people suffer from the \nescape field of disease to Wuhan originate in other parts under hostility. they are attacked insulted or even physically. as in Germany living Chinese girl me angry so much the expectable human inhumanity in the small, angry me the profiteers in the large. like many other Chinese people in Germany I have much respect and hospitality here. right, law and social norms are directed in Germany so fine on the prevention of racism that I was once I got used to it, shocked at how much one tolerance on the other hand as in the United States for the pronouncements of neo applies. I have experienced racist failures, but they never considered symptomatic. but for the behavior of people who believe in distress (or even are) and a search valve. We are now epidemic in times of, before the danger of a global resurgence of anti-Chinese racism, warn of the many watchful observer? I am not sure yet. is true that there can never be wrong to thwart a dangerous social development, before it is too late. but in asking how to appear to the deeply divided most effective doing, especially in a time when many companies already, I have probably a different opinion. at the individual level, I find anti-racist slogans such as \"chinese are not a virus!\" or \"is not a racist!\" unhelpful. there are people who are racists to the mark. are racists always a pretext find to attack others. racists have to fight. but to scold a Parisian saleswoman because they will face Chinese tourists nervous, or a German employed who suddenly do not like to sit with his Chinese colleagues in the meeting room more, I come over the top before. the better off people to take their fears and those \nTo avoid clashes, solid information about potential infection paths, risks and measures that can be protected by providing themselves. It is much better to show people that they can do something against the risk of infectance, instead of being damaged because of their fears. At the political and social level, things look different. Would the spread of the coronavirus to the truly worldwide pandemic, this could lead to tribalism in the worst shape, especially at a time in which it can be exploited by right populists - such as Donald Trump, the Brexit camp, European right-wing radicals - politically. Racism is nothing more than one of the many formations of tribalism. Through rupture headings you can heat up, even if the editors of the Courrier Picard or the mirror have probably not want to stand on the wrong side. The attraction of nationalism is still strong. Compared to other countries, I experience great alertness in Germany across nationalist narratives. But that they also exist elsewhere, but even more successful politically used, one must be more aware of it in Germany. In China, the government has long been teaching people to consider the Communist Party, the Land and the Population as a unity. This is an effective way to assure yourself of the loyalty of all citizens and give them a false membership and home experience. That is why many foreign experienced people feel personally attacked if they hear how nonquatisen criticize the Communist Party of China or the government. You have learned to completely identify yourself with party and state. Unfortunately, many Germans, German media and even German politics occasionally make the same mistake and confuse people in China with their government. There are facts about which in \nthe European media is still too little reported. The new coronavirus is not \"Made in China\", as little as Ebola \"Made in Africa\" \u200b\u200bis. These viruses were not made with intention how to manufacture products that print the designation of origin \"Made in\". But the arrogant and authoritarian system in China has enabled the dissemination of the plague initially by non-action. Many Chinese injects, especially in the region around Wuhan, slowly recognize that they have seen eyes in a crisis situation: the seriousness of the situation and the dangers were covered. Other Chinese and Chinese still hold their belief in the allegedly omnipotent government because they are the only stop they know. The crisis in China has many facets. There is a lack of transparency; The government and the authorities can not be considered to be responsible for their actions or non-handling; The state health system is weak; There is no freedom of expression in the country. Many Chinese and Chinese are risking their lives (and their freedom) to defeat the virus and bypassing the obstacles that the authoritarian system puts them in the way. If the world knew from your services and acknowledge you, there is no longer any antichinese tendencies elsewhere. As long as people outside of China have no clear picture of it, they will see the outbreak of the Coronavirus only as a threatening state of emergency, which has its origins in \"China\", a country of which they only have a vague presentation. \"China\" is guilt! This vague presentation of \"China\" is already a form of tribalism because it is fed by stereotypes and not from the viewing of a country and its residents, the existences and services of individuals. of people fighting against the arrogance of power that prevails about them; the truth \nsearch and spread; which faces a crisis with great bravery and intellectual glimpse; But also to fight with their own human weaknesses - idiotie has no home and country of origin. The stories of the brave Chinese and Chinese but must be heard. Camus has taught us about the plague: \"Evil in the world almost always stirs from ignorance, and the good will without understanding can do so much damage as the malice.\" Camus said deep understanding, no indeterminate half-knowledge. It is courage to look at the whole truth because you could find them offensive; because they could insult others with it; Because you may feel uncomfortable with her or other malaise. From this coronavirus crisis could first learn that one must distinguish between the Chinese government and the people in China. This, it would be a progress.

biochemical conflict at leiden university medical centre in the netherlands.   \"all viruses, including this one, will have multiple ways that they look to circumvent or suppress immune response ... there's an arms race, especially in the beginning, when the virus is trying to \nprevent these first responses,\" ms kikkert said.   once the immune system is triggered and a t-cell finds a body cell that has become a virus factory, it typically latches on and fires molecules that punch through the cell's membrane, killing it and everything inside.   but as sars-cov-2 is a newly discovered virus, researchers have not had enough laboratory time to determine the specifics of how the battle plays out. that leaves questions like why some healthy people infected with sars-cov-2 become severely ill and others do not, researchers have said.   much of what is suspected about how the body fights back is based on research on the body's immune response to closely related coronavirus infections, such as middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars). there are also the clinical records of patients with covid-19, the disease caused by sars-cov-2.   what that indicates is that \"every part of the immune system is needed to clear this virus\", according to mr stanley perlman, a professor of immunology at the university of iowa, whose lab is now replenishing its stock of lab mice genetically engineered for research on immune response to sars.   as the body's immune response can be so aggressive, researchers say that the war against the virus can do damage that causes fatal repercussions in the body.   in particular, sars-cov-2 attacks the lungs, an especially sensitive battleground. also, as the immune system tries to fight a virus that it has never before encountered, it can go into overdrive, causing excessive damage to adjoining cells and tissue.   the body's early-warning system for invading pathogens was multilayered, ms kikkert said. an abnormality inside a cell would typically trigger a \"cascade\" of cell signals.   she said this led to the production of \"alarm bell\" proteins that warned surrounding cells about the presence of the virus and triggered a flood of immune molecules, creating an \"antiviral state\".   as more \nalarms sound throughout the body, the sars-cov-2 virus races to propagate and attack more cells. when t-cells arrive to hunt, capture and kill infected cells, the lungs become a battleground, swelling with immune cells, molecules and the fluid that they use to navigate.   mr olinger said that once a t-cell found an infected cell it latched on, \"almost like a velcro connection\". \"these cells will attach and send molecules that go through that cell and start to kill it,\" he said.   meanwhile, antibodies, y-shaped proteins, also arrive and swarm onto the virus, smothering the spikes it uses to attach to healthy cells. larger white blood cells called macrophages also sweep in, swallowing big clusters of dead virus particles.   as this cellular carnage spreads, dead cells pile up in the lungs.   \"they are clogging the airways and reducing the oxygen flow,\" said ms ashley st john, an assistant professor at duke-nus medical school in singapore who researches immune pathology.   \"you need that tissue to be able to stretch and fill with oxygen, but at the same time you are filling it with immune cells and fluid ... it can prevent someone who is trying to breathe from getting enough oxygen,\" she said.   some patients who recover from this stage, their lungs can heal. others may recover, but suffer lasting damage.   china released data at the end of february that indicates that about 80 per cent of the sars-cov-2 infections were mild to moderate, while 14 per cent were severe. the remaining 6 per cent of critical patients may have suffered respiratory failure, septic shock, and multiple organ failure.   globally, about 3.4 per cent of infected people might die from a sars-cov-2 infection, the world health organization (who) said last week, although that number may change as disease controls evolve. in china, the fatality rate fell during the course of the outbreak and the increase in infections.   in interviews, researchers said that the exact way sars-cov-2 behaved in the \nbody was still being investigated, but it was clear it took the heaviest toll on the elderly and people with weakened immune systems.   more than 20 per cent of infected people aged over 80 were likely to die. death rates for those with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and chronic respiratory disease are double the average rate, according to statistics from the who-china joint mission on covid-19 published at the end of february.   some researchers suspect that in the \"hide-and-seek\" period, sars-cov-2 compromises the early immune response, either by dividing too rapidly for the system to keep up or disrupting the way the immune system regulates itself.   there was some evidence this can push a panicked system into overdrive and a \"cytokine storm\" follows that causes tissue inflammation.   \"with a cytokine storm you have a situation where the brakes aren't working and you have all of these [immune] products [going] out of control ... cells infiltrating into the tissue, breakdown of blood vessels,\" st john said.   as the body sent out alarms for cells to come to fight the virus, too many or the wrong combination could show up, causing excessive tissue damage, mr olinger said.   \"the lung is the worst place to have that happen. those cells are there to kill, they are there to encapsulate, and control the infection ... over-response can lead to the damage in the lungs. cells in that region are not able to transfer oxygen ... it can lead to death of the tissue.\"   an overwhelming immune response could also lead to death itself, researchers said.   getting to the bottom of the \"dance\" between the virus and the immune system's response was something that was hard to do without watching it play out in cells and in animals, mr olinger said.   \"the reality is that until you have the virus in hand you really can't answer a lot of those questions,\" he added.   \"[this virus] turned science upside down on us, because we know more about the genomic sequence now, whereas in the \npast other outbreaks that would come way after we had grown the virus and played with it in the laboratory, known how it performs in different cell types.\"   that is the work now facing researchers like those in mr perlman's laboratory as they hope to use mice to get a ringside seat to the fight between sars-cov-2 and a mammal immune system.   such work needed to be done to work out how to build a sars-cov-2 vaccine, mr perlman said.   \"how do you make a vaccine that works well if you are not sure what you need to protect a person from infection?\" south china morning post "}, {"content": "Coronavirus: Brent oil falls 2% with fears

The Bavarian health authorities confirmed the four first cases in the Federal Republic on Tuesday. First, the new lung disease had been demonstrated from the district of Landsberg am Lech at a 33-year-old man. He had infected himself in his company in a suburb of Munich at a colleague from China. On Tuesday evening, the Bavarian Ministry of Health announced that three more people have infected with the novel coronavirus. \"These patients are also staff of the company from the district of Starnberg,\" it continued. The four those affected were stored in the Munich clinic Schwabing stationary and medically monitored and isolated, as the Ministry announced. \"For some other contact persons, there is currently a test whether there is an infection with the coronavirus here too.\" Bavaria's Minister of Health Melanie Huml (CSU) said: \"A total of around 40 employees of the company were determined, which come into question as close contact persons. The affected persons should be tested on Wednesday as a precaution. \"Then the ministry also wants to inform the current state of affairs by press release. The 33-year-old had infected himself according to the Bavarian Provincial Office for Health and Food Safety (LGL) at a colleague from China, which had come to a training to the car supplier Webasto in the Gautinger district Stockdorf in the Upper Bavarian district of Starnberg in the past week. The woman had noticed her infection on 23 January on the return flight to China. The novel coronavirus 2019-NCOV can trigger a lung disease, which has already died more than 100 people in the main distribution country China - most of them were older patients with severe pre-existing conditions. The total number of worldwide diseases is now \nrose to more than 4500, in China at least 106 people died of lung disease. The first coronavirus patient had been positively tested on the virus on Monday - since he had gone to work again. \"He's pretty good, yesterday morning he was still working,\" said LGL President Andreas Zapf. \"He's fever-free, has no respiratory symptoms anymore,\" added to the treating chief physician Clemens Wendtner from the Klinikum Schwabing. The man is in an insulating room, for other patients there is no danger. The people who had contacted Chinese and the first-diseased German Webasto staff are under observation according to LGL information and are invited not to leave their home. The 33-year-old patient is family father, his child goes according to the Ministry of Health in a crib in the district of Landsberg am Lech. Even these are now under observation, said LGL President Zapf. Nothing was known about the marital status of the three other patients. The head of Taskforce Infektiology, Martin high, emphasized: \"The number can still rise.\" The new virus 2019-NCOV originally comes from a market in the Chinese met city of Wuhan, where it was probably overwhelmed by the wild animals traded on man. According to the current assessment of experts, the novel lung disease apparently runs in most cases mild, possibly even without symptoms. Transfers before the first symptoms are considered very rare. Thus, the first confirmed Coronavirus case in Germany possibly also provides new insights on the contagion paths of lung disease. For the man had infected himself after first findings at the Chinesein, although she did not show any symptoms of the disease at the time. The authorities now want to initiate further action in Bavaria. An official hotline of the Bavarian authorities was switched, some \nHealth insurance companies did that too. At Munich Airport, according to the State Office with posters in three languages, the passengers are asked to visit a doctor if an infection with the novel Coronavirus. Further escalation stages of the alarm plan are possible: Currently, together with the federal government, \"whether it can be useful to measure fever at airports,\" said Minister Huml. The world's largest playwear fair in Nuremberg is expecting less visitors from China in view of the Coronavirus outbreak this year. There is no reason to panic, I did not emphasize Huml - as well as her office colleague, Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU). The case show, \"that we are well prepared,\" he said. The threat to the health of the people in Germany remains low even after assessing the Robert Koch Institute. Nevertheless, respiratory protective masks were sold out in individual pharmacies in Bavaria. He had heard this of companies in Lower Franconia and Munich, said a spokesman for the Bavarian Pharmacist Association of the German Press Agency. The management of Webasto has released the employees in the Stockdorfer headquarters for this week, whether they want to come to the office, or prefer to work at home. Webasto is a large supplier for the automotive industry with 13 400 employees and sales of 3.4 billion euros. Earlier before, the company had canceled all the service tracks to China for the next two weeks. BMW, Audi and Siemens also stated that only mandatory missions to China. (dpa) "}, {"content": "China confirms nine dead and 440 cases of Wuhan Coronavirus. The Wuhan virus has overflowed the control of the Chinese authorities. There are already nine fatal victims and the number of infected continues to grow with every hour of day: the latest data speak of 440 patients. To put in perspective: Friday were only 41, and the Municipal Health Commission ensured that medical tests did not throw positive results since January 3. The climbing of this new coronavirus, discovered two weeks ago, recalls that of SARS, with which it saves genetic similarities. The epidemic of 2002, also originated in China, caused the death of 700 people around the world.\nMost of the infections (270) is concentrated in Wuhan, epicenter of the outbreak emerged in December. From this city, located in the central area of \u200b\u200bthe Chinese territory and home of 11 million people -more London or New York-, the pathogen has begun to extend to the neighboring provinces. If last Friday there was no positive out there, today there are 38 cases distributed by another 15 large cities.\nBut these data may not be entirely reliable. A model developed by experts from the Epidemiology Center for Infectious Diseases from Hong Kong University suggests that reality is even more worrisome than the official figures reveal. According to its report, prepared in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) and presented on Tuesday, the total number of infected could already rub at 1,500: 1,343 in Wuhan and 115 in the rest of the country.\nSkepticism is logical, inicing of a country in which freedom of information does not prevail. Many also remember the precedent of SARS, when the authorities denied the existence of the virus for weeks. The Chinese Communist Party has referred to that same episode to warn local and regional administrations that they must accurately report on the course of the facts. \"Everyone who does not say the truth will be nailed to the pillar of shame for all eternity,\" Chan An Jian proclaimed Monday, official profile of the Central Commission of Political and Legal Affairs, Supervisor Arm of the Party on Legal Party . This sentence adds to yesterday's intervention of the Secretary General Xi Jinping, in which he called \"take away\" the containment of the outbreak.\nThere is another reason for uneasiness: the estimates of the model of the University of Hong Kong respond to a \"moderate scenario\", in which Wuhan remains as the only focus of the outbreak and do not appear highly contagious, known as \"superproopagers\". This last risk factor, however, could already be a reality.\nWHO performed a visit to Wuhan next to a group of Chinese health experts, led by Dr. Zhong Nanshan, director of the State Laboratory for Infectious Diseases in Canton and National Eminence. Their findings show that 15 medical employees in the city would have contracted the virus, which confirms the possibility of contagion between humans - an extreme discarded until this weekend. 14 of them, in addition, would have been infected by a single patient, as Nanshan revealed yesterday in an interview with national television, which opens the door to the existence of these \"superprophatemen\". \"The key to controlling expansion at this time goes by preventing its appearance,\" said the researcher.\nMeanwhile, international expansion continues. To the four cases located to date in Thailand, Japan and South Korea, the first positive in Taiwan has been added on Tuesday. It is a woman of 55 years who, as in the previous cases, also visited Wuhan in recent weeks. \"The patient developed the symptoms as of January 11, but she did not enter a hospital,\" Huang Wang-Ting, doctor of Taiwan Epidemias Central Command, reported. The Minister of Health of the Island, Chen Shih-Chung, has ensured that none of the relatives of the sick presents any symptom, similar to those of ordinary pneumonia, and that another 46 people who were in contact with her during the journey of Airplane have been put into observation. Likewise, the Philippines and Australia have also announced having taken measures before the first suspected cases in their national territory.\nThe WHO has communicated that an emergency meeting will be held tomorrow, an emergency meeting to decide whether it declares \"an international public health emergency\" because of the outbreak. The Chinese State Council, for its part, has also scheduled a press conference in which it will detail the evolution of the virus in the last hours.

finding it difficult to get tested or receive treatment for the new form of coronavirus, which authorities say has infected more than 4,000 people and killed at least 106 in china, a situation that may be contributing to the spread of the disease.   yang has been unable to gain full-time admission to a hospital, her son said. she has been put on drips in unquarantined areas at four separate hospitals in the city to treat her deteriorating lungs, he said, while he is doing what he can to get her tested or admitted full-time.   \"my brother and i have been queuing at the hospital every day. we go at 6 and 7 in the morning, and queue for the whole day, but we don't get any new answers,\" zhang told reuters. \"every time the responses are the same: 'there's no bed, wait for the government to give a notice, and follow the news to see what's going on.' the doctors are all very frustrated too.\"   officially known as 2019-ncov, the new form of coronavirus was first identified as the cause of death of a 61-year-old man in wuhan on jan\u00a010, when china shared gene information on the virus with other countries. some, such as japan and thailand, started testing travellers from china for the virus within three days.   however, testing kits for the disease were not distributed to some of wuhan's hospitals until about jan\u00a020, an official at the hubei provincial centre for disease control and prevention (hubei cdc) told reuters.   before then, samples had to be sent to a laboratory in beijing for testing, a process that took three to five days to get results, according to wuhan health \nauthorities.   during that gap, hospitals in the city reduced the number of people under medical observation from 739 to just 82, according to data compiled by reuters from wuhan health authorities, and no new cases were reported inside china.   despite the lack of reliable data and testing capacity in wuhan, chinese authorities assured citizens in the days after the virus had been identified that it was not widely transmissible.   in previous weeks, it had censored negative online commentary about the situation, and arrested eight people it accused of being \"rumour spreaders\".   \"the doctor didn\u2019t wear a mask, we didn\u2019t know how to protect ourselves ... no one told us anything,\" a 45-year-old woman surnamed chen told reuters.   her aunt was confirmed to have the virus on jan\u00a020, five days after she was hospitalised. \"i posted my aunt\u2019s photos on (chinese social media site) weibo and the police called the hospital authorities. they told me to take it down.\"   national, regional and city health officials did not respond to requests for comment from reuters on how the virus outbreak has been handled.\u00a0national officials did say at a media briefing last week that there were some \"loopholes\" in initial treatment methods.   wuhan's mayor, zhou xianwang, told chinese state television on monday he recognised that \"all parties were not satisfied with the disclosure of our information\".\u00a0but he pointed to strictures placed upon him by provincial and national leaders.   \"in local governance, after i receive information, i can only release it when i'm authorised,\" he said. zhou told a media briefing on sunday that a further 1,000 people could be diagnosed with the virus in wuhan, based on the number of patients yet to be tested.   delayed response   china last week locked down the affected region in hubei province in the biggest quarantine operation on record and is building two new hospitals to treat virus patients. president xi jinping has created a special committee to tackle \nthe outbreak.   the country has been praised internationally for quickly sequencing the virus gene. however, its slow scale-up of testing has been questioned.   once a virus has been identified, \"you need to make sure you have all the reagent (a substance used in chemical analysis) samples and you\u2019ve got it all pushed out to where you want to do testing,\" said amesh adalja, a senior scholar at the johns hopkins university center for health security, who focuses on emerging infectious disease and pandemic preparedness.      although information from the region is scarce, adalja suggested china has had problems with this stage of tackling the outbreak. \"we\u2019re already hearing that there are shortages of medical professionals there, that there are shortages of test kits and medicines,\" he said.   john edmunds, a professor at the centre for mathematical modelling of infectious diseases at the london school of hygiene & tropical medicine, said china has not communicated enough detailed data after the initial outbreak.   \"we have a very incomplete picture of what\u2019s going on,\" he told reuters. \"whether it\u2019s incompetence, secrecy, or deliberate, i don\u2019t know, but it would be very useful if we could have some basic epidemiological data.\"   the shortage of testing supplies and china's initial reticence have drawn criticism that the country is still learning lessons from the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) in 2002 that killed almost 800 people.   \"the improvements have been on the hard science side - figuring out the virus's genome, building new hospitals at a moment's notice - more than on the soft science side of managing information and dealing with people,\" said mary gallagher, a political science professor who leads the university of michigan's center for chinese studies.   city managers had little incentive to escalate problems to political superiors. the week in which no new virus cases were reported in hubei coincided with preparations for chinese \nnew year and sessions of the province's national people's congress and the chinese people's political consultative conference.   still waiting   seven of the largest hospitals in wuhan are now equipped with testing kits for the virus, which in theory deliver results within a day, the hubei cdc official said.   but four people told reuters they were refused tests because the process involved a complex reporting system including hospital, district and city health authorities and disease control officials.   to qualify for the test, patients need to meet certain criteria, such as having symptoms of fever and pneumonia, and a surge in patients means it is \"impossible to conduct the test right away\", an official at the wuhan centre for disease control and prevention told reuters.      three hospital and local government workers, who have been briefed on how doctors are handling tests and confirming cases, told reuters that official numbers of infections and deaths do not reflect the actual toll.   wuhan health authorities have a limit on tests, chiefly because of the shortage of testing kits, and are screening lists of patients before deciding who gets a test, which takes several hours, one hospital worker told reuters.   \"some severely ill patients were left out from the final list for testing because they know they wouldn't be able to be treated,\" the worker told reuters. \"the actual deaths were higher.\"   reuters could not independently confirm the hospital worker's account. hubei and wuhan health authorities did not respond to reuters requests for comment.   zhang, whose mother is still waiting for a test, said doctors at three wuhan hospitals told her family privately that they are almost certain she has contracted the coronavirus.   however, he said two of those hospitals told him they are not equipped with testing kits, and the other told him it has no available bed to accommodate his mother for the test.   none of those hospitals replied to reuters requests for \ncomment.

entry to foreign nationals who had been to china within the 14-day incubation period.    that measure followed on from an earlier travel advisory that warned americans not to travel to china and angered beijing.    originating in the chinese city of wuhan, the flu-like virus first identified earlier in january has resulted in 213 deaths in china, according to local health authorities. wuhan

international concern, a designation that triggers tighter global containment measures and coordination.    \"following the world health organization's decision... i have today declared that the coronavirus presents a public health emergency in the united states,\" u.s. health secretary alex azar said at a public briefing on friday afternoon.    as of sunday, u.s. citizens who had been in hubei would be subject to compulsory quarantine, he said. foreign nationals - aside from the immediate family of citizens and residents - who had travelled in china in the last 14 days would be denied entry, said azar.    \"the risk is low in the united states... but our job is to keep that risk low as much as we can,\" he said.    the move will likely anger beijing, which has only just started to mend tattered trade ties with washington. earlier on friday, it criticized the u.s. travel warning.    \"the world health organization urged countries to avoid travel restrictions, but very \nsoon

The WHO has made this Wednesday from Geneva an appeal to the Member States and private donors to raise $ 675 million (about 610 million euros) to deal with the expansion of the Wuhan Coronavirus. \"It's a lot of money, but it's much less than what it will be necessary if we do not contain the virus on time,\" the general director of the agency, Tedros ADHANOM GHEBREYESUS. This is the amount that the organism calculates that it needs until April 30, most to help countries with more precarious health systems to be prepared for a possible arrival and expansion of the virus in its territory, reports Oriol G\u00fcell. GheBeyesus wanted to synthesize his request with the following motto: \"We invest today or pay much more in the future.\" The General Director of the Agency has shown \"grateful\" with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which is now committed to contribute \"up to 100 million dollars in the global response\" to Coronavirus. To the city of Wenzhou, in the eastern province of Zhejiang, which became the first city outside Habei to close its quarantine accesses, some districts of Hangzhou, Ningbo's port and the city of Taizhou have also been added. In total, this measure affects about 18 million people in this province. Other locations along the Chinese coast and in the province of Heilongjiang, in the northeastern, have adopted measures \nSimilar. A district of Zhumadian city in the province of Henan -Limitrophe has ordered that only one person from each house comes out, and only every five days, to buy supplies. This district has offered its residents a reward for denouncing people from Hubei who can be found in the region. The main Hongkonese Air Company, Cathay Pacific, has asked its 27,000 employees to take three weeks of license without a salary to avoid the spread of Coronavirus, according to its general manager, Augustus Tang, cited by France Presse. \"I hope everyone participates, from our employees who are on the front line (in contact with customers) to our executives,\" Tang declared in a video hanging on the Internet. The airline, which had already suffered a harsh drop in its demand due to anti-government protests in Hong Kong, has also requested rebates to its suppliers, has frozen hiring and paralyzed all non-critical expenses. On Tuesday, he had already announced that he planned a 30% cutout of his capacity for the next two months, including 90% of flights to China. US Airlines United Airlines and American Airlines will suspend their flights to Hong Kong, one of the most important air connection centers in the world, due to the fall of passenger traffic by the Coronavirus. The cancellation of the routes will be prolonged, in principle, until February 20. American has already canceled its flights, while UNITE will stop traveling from Saturday. The two airlines had already suspended their trips to mainland China. The organizers of the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo have been declared \"severely concerned\" by the impact that the propagation of the new Coronavirus 2019-Ncov can have on the world's largest sports event. \"I hope this can be resolved as soon as possible,\" has declared the CEO of the Organizing Committee, Toshiro Muto, at a meeting with \nThe organizers of the Paralympic Games. Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, has held that the Government of Him will make all possible efforts to prevent the epidemic from impairing the development of the Games, which will begin on July 24. The four friends of the German tourist who gave positive in the coronavirus in La Gomera, the only case confirmed in Spain, were discharged from the hospital on Tuesday by giving negative for the second time in the analyzes. Tourists, who had remained isolated in the hospital center, will stay at the apartment of the Gomera de Hermigua town who had rented for their holidays, where it has remained isolated these days in observation of another of her companions.

"}, {"content": "the shadow of sars: china learned the hard way how to handle an epidemic. shanghai (reuters) - the emergence of a new virus in central china has brought back painful memories of another virulent respiratory disease that wreaked worldwide havoc and left the country\u2019s health authorities struggling to rebuild public trust. but global health experts said china has come a long way since 2003, when it was accused of trying to cover up a major outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars), a previously unknown virus believed to have emerged from the wet markets of guangdong province before spreading into major cities. as many as 774 people died in an epidemic that reached nearly 30 countries. now, nearly 17 years later, government officials insist they have learned from past mistakes as they try to contain the latest deadly viral pneumonia strain, which has infected 440 people, mostly in wuhan city, and killed nine since it was first identified at the end of last month. liu heng, an adviser to china\u2019s cabinet said it took the country about four or five months to announce the sars outbreak to the public, and this time it had taken less than a month. \u201cwe are doing much better now... we are paying greater attention to preventing the epidemic,\u201d he told reporters. li bin, vice minister at the national health commission, told reporters on wednesday that since 2003, china had established comprehensive new procedures to handle major health threats. \u201cwith relatively complete prevention and control systems for sudden and infectious diseases in place since sars ... and with the support of the broad masses of the public, we are confident of victory,\u201d he said. a key factor watched by experts both at home and overseas has been the rapid disclosure of information about the genetic structure of the virus and the way it has spread through the population. li said beijing had learned from its experiences with sars and was now sharing all relevant data with international stakeholders, \nincluding the world health organization (who). \u201cthe speed with which this virus has been identified is testament to changes in public health in china since sars and strong global coordination through the who,\u201d said jeremy farrar, a british infectious diseases specialist who also worked on combating sars. experts say the failures of sars were caused by an under-resourced and overcentralised health system with little experience of infectious diseases and no information disclosure mechanisms. local governments were also reluctant to take responsibility for the rapid spread of infections. beijing has since established the china information system for disease control and prevention that hooks up hospitals and clinics nationwide and reports outbreaks in real time. it has also set up specific mechanisms for new pneumonia strains. \u201cchina... has developed excellent disease surveillance systems since sars, including real-time emergency department surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections, so this will help with rapid identification of new cases,\u201d said raina macintyre, head of the biosecurity research programme at the kirby institute in sydney. vice-minister li said china\u2019s health infrastructure was also now better able to cope, with the country ready to deploy several \u201cback-up\u201d hospitals that could be put into action should the number of infected people spike further. the silence on the part of authorities during the early stages of sars helped create a rumor mill that sparked panic in several major cities and brought the economy to a standstill. one estimate suggested china\u2019s economy slowed by around 1-2 percentage points in 2003 as a result of sars. this time, officials have been warned they face public ignominy if they cover up any infections, and the message throughout state media has been about the need for greater transparency. communist party-backed tabloid global times said on wednesday that \u201cconcealment would be a serious blow to the government\u2019s \ncredibility and might trigger greater social panic\u201d. president xi jinping has vowed to curb the spread of the virus, which has erupted just before the nation begins its biggest holiday this week, the lunar new year, when hundreds of millions people travel. nevertheless, some people said chinese officials are cracking down on those who spread news about the disease online. social media is still awash with cover-up claims, and some doubts are still being expressed about the accuracy and timeliness of china\u2019s data. \u201cwe can only judge the information we are being provided and have no way to determine if any information is not being disclosed,\u201d said macintyre. and the big test of lessons learned could be still to come, when new year travel could create countless new vectors for the potential transmission of the virus. adam kamradt-scott, an infectious diseases expert at the centre for international security studies at the university of sydney, said china has \u201ccome a long way\u201d since the outbreak of sars. \u201ci\u2019m not sure that we could expect more of them at this stage in the outbreak, particularly when they are understandably focused on responding to the outbreak and trying to contain it ahead of the chinese lunar new year celebrations,\u201d he said.

'champions league match huge accelerator for contagion' luca lorini, the head of the intensive care unit at the pope john xxiii hospital in bergamo, currently has 88 patients under his care with the coronavirus; not including many more in other parts of the hospital. \"i'm sure that 40,000 people hugging and kissing each other while standing a centimeter apart - four times, because atalanta scored four goals (the final result was 4-1) - was definitely a huge accelerator for contagion,\" lorini told the associated press on wednesday. \"right now we're at war. when peace time comes, i can assure you we will go and see how many of the 40,000 people who went to the game became infected,\" lorini added. \"right now we have other priorities.\" silvio brusaferro, the head of italy's superior institute of health, said over the weekend at the nightly nationally televised briefing by the civil protection agency that the game was \"one of the hypotheses\" being evaluated as a source of the crisis in bergamo. \"it's certainly an analysis that can be made,\" brusaferro said. by last week, bergamo's cemetery became so overwhelmed by the number of dead that military trucks began transporting bodies to a neighboring region for cremation. italy remained the european country with the most cases, nearly 70,000, and with almost 7,000 deaths - the most worldwide and more than twice as many as china. spain is the next country in europe with the most cases, nearly 48,000, and it has surpassed china in the number of deaths with more than 3,400. more than 435,000 people worldwide have been infected and the number of dead closed in on 20,000, according to the running count kept by johns hopkins university. overall, more than 100,000 have \nrecovered. for most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. the official attendance for the feb. 19 game was 45,792 - a \"home\" record for atalanta, a small club making its debut in europe's top club competition. atalanta captain alejandro \"papu\" g\u00f3mez told argentine daily ol\u00e9 it was \"terrible\" to have played that game. \"it's a city of 120,000 people and that day (40,000) went to the san siro,\" the argentine said. \"it was a historic match for atalanta, something unique. to give you an idea, my wife took three hours to get to milan, when that trip normally takes 40 minutes.\" the game was played in milan because atalanta's stadium in bergamo didn't meet the requirements set by european soccer governing body uefa. before the match, valencia fans freely roamed around milan and gathered at some of the city's plazas, including the piazza del duomo, drinking and chanting team songs. looking back, the conditions for virus contagion were high, with thousands of people gathering without much concern - at a time when the outbreak in europe wasn't yet known - and then traveling back home. nearly 30 busloads of fans made the 60-kilometer (37-mile) trip from bergamo to milan. the evening before the match, there was no social distancing as officials from both clubs mingled and exchanged gifts and handshakes at a gala dinner offered by atalanta. \"i have heard a lot (of theories), i'll say mine: feb. 19, 40,000 bergamaschi went to san siro for atalanta-valencia,\" fabiano di marco, the chief pneumologist at the hospital in bergamo, told italian newspaper corriere della sera. \"in buses, cars, trains. a biological bomb, unfortunately.\" valencia defender ezequiel garay was the first spanish league player to test positive for covid-19. the team played a spanish league \ngame against alav\u00e9s about two weeks after the game in milan, and later alav\u00e9s reported that 15 people in the club were infected, though it did not say the cases were directly related to the match against valencia. look at atlanta match before restarting leagues: italian football association president italian soccer players' association president damiano tommasi believes sports authorities should look long and hard at the atalanta match before restarting leagues. \"look at what's happening in china, where players are testing positive for the coronavirus now - despite all the safety rules and precautions being taken,\" tommasi told the ap, referring to a recent positive test for former manchester united midfielder marouane fellaini with chinese club shandong lunen. fellaini's positive test was alarming because, while the outbreak began spreading in china, the virus has reportedly been receding there. \"it's not going to be enough to just test the athletes,\" tommasi added. \"the entire setting needs to be safe. because if one team is stuck, it blocks the entire system.\" after winning the first leg, atalanta advanced to the champions league quarterfinals following another victory in the second leg on march 10, which was played in an empty mestalla stadium in valencia after spanish authorities prohibited games involving teams from northern italy to be played with fans. a few thousand valencia supporters gathered at the mestalla to welcome the team, though, and to watch the match together in nearby bars and restaurants. over the past month, atalanta has mourned the deaths of five former staff members. while announcements on the club website made no mention of the virus, local media have reported that at least four of them died with covid-19. still, only one positive test from atalanta has been announced. \"some squads have chosen not to test their players unless they show symptoms,\" tommasi said. \"other squads tested everyone. these are individual choices. \"the head of the \ncivil protection agency has talked about the likelihood that for every proven positive case there are probably 10 actual positives. the high number of positives at valencia makes you wonder.\" with the champions league suspended because of the pandemic, atalanta has no idea when it might play in the quarterfinals - which again would be the club's biggest game in its history. in the meantime, both the bergamo team and valencia are left wondering about the unforeseen effects of their match in february.

coronavirus cases believed to have emerged from community transmission of the infection, signaling a turning point in efforts to contain the disease in the united states. the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) issued a statement on friday citing three such cases newly diagnosed by state public health authorities - one each in california, oregon and washington state. if confirmed by the cdc, together with a previous case of unknown origin announced on wednesday in california, that would bring to four the number of diagnosed individuals in the united states with no history of travel to a country where the virus is circulating and no close contact with an infected person. the three latest patients were diagnosed based on results obtained in their respective states from cdc-supplied test kits and are considered \u201cpresumptive positive\u201d cases pending cdc confirmatory testing, the u.s. agency said. a fourth presumptive positive was also announced in washington state on friday, but that one is \u201clikely travel-related,\u201d the cdc said. still, the three latest cases of apparent community transmission, plus the one identified earlier this week in california, are a sign the virus is now spreading within at least four separate locations up and down the u.s. west coast. they span nearly 900 miles from california\u2019s silicon valley region in santa clara county north to the puget sound near seattle. \u201cwhat we know now is that the virus is here, present at some level, but we still don\u2019t know to what degree,\u201d said dr. sara cody, the chief public health officer for santa clara county, speaking of the newly diagnosed case there, the latest of three in her county and the 10th statewide. even as confirmation was pending there, the cdc sent a team to assist local authorities in tracing close contacts the \npatient had with others in a bid to curb transmission. until this week, the cdc had counted 15 confirmed cases in six states as having been detected through the u.s. public health system since jan. 21, none fatal. most were contracted by individuals while traveling in china, where the outbreak originated. only two person-to-person transmissions were documented among them, both between married couples. an additional 47 cases have been confirmed among people recently repatriated from abroad, either from the diamond princess cruise ship quarantined in japan or from wuhan, china, the epicenter of the outbreak, according to the cdc. the latest flurry of cases came as the trump administration said the united states would invoke a federal defense law to boost production of masks, gloves, gowns and other items needed to protect medical personnel from exposure. around the world, more countries are reporting new infections, companies have curtailed travel and global stock markets have tumbled. president donald trump said at the white house on friday the united states will decide \u201cvery soon\u201d about whether to bar entry to travelers from countries other than china where community transmission has emerged. at a rally in south carolina on friday night, trump defended his administration\u2019s

(graphic - tracking the novel coronavirus: here) "}, {"content": "Quarantine in Wuhan: trapped in the epicenter of Coronavirus. This morning, the streets in Wuhan are little traveled. A mantle of contamination covers the sky, giving it a gray and thick aspect. At ten o'clock on the morning of this Thursday, three in the morning in the peninsular Spain, the veto announced on Wednesday was entered into force by local authorities. From that moment, and until further notice, the 11 million people who are within the population can not leave it, nor can anyone enter, which makes this municipality in the center of China in a closed city. The Chinese government intends, in this way, to place the propagation of the newly discovered Coronavirus 2019-Ncov, which has made a significant progress in recent days, both outside and within their borders. The most recent data place the cases in 18 dead and about 634 infected. This measure affects all flights, trains and buses, as well as the metro service. At Yunfei station, for example, have placed a grate on all accesses less one. There, a security guard who prefers not to reveal the name of him comments, something before at ten o'clock in the morning, the closure, that the number of people is much less than a normal day. He confesses \"eager to return home.\" The prohibition also affects interurban taxis, although on the street is seen, and in Didi - a telephone application similar to Uber- no drivers available. The highways have been cut, so private cars can not leave the city either. This blockade is one of the measures that includes the highest gravity action protocol, whose start-up announced on Wednesday the Council of State, although the scenario remains cataloged as infectious level B disease, the second highest. Another of the precepts contemplated is the mobilization of the armed forces. A nearby city, Huanggang, located 70 kilometers from Wuhan, \nIt will also close the public bus and train services at the end of this Thursday, according to your mayor. The authorities have also decreed the closure of the location entertainment premises of 7.5 million inhabitants, such as cinemas or Internet cafes, and have asked the population that they do not leave it except for special circumstances, reports Reuters. It will do the same the relatively smallest Ezhou, of a population of one million residents. Faced with the announcement of the fence in Wuhan, a large number of people put direction to the airport and the train stations with the purpose of leaving the city before it came into force. One of them was Niki, a 22-year-old Taiwanese student who had come to Wuhan to visit a friend of her. She Niki expressed the conviction that she would achieve on time, as she had found a particular driver willing to take her. \"I have come to the wrong place!\" She said goodbye to her as she ran down the street pushing her suitcases. Wuhan Airport has been saturated, with billing queues up to 100 meters, according to local media. With this decision, the Government aims to isolate the population, epicenter of the outbreak, something particularly important given the proximity of the Chinese New Year. To this festival, which will take place next Saturday, follows a week of national holidays in which people are used to visiting family in other parts of the country or travel abroad. The displacements can reach these days the figure of 3,000 million, in which it constitutes the greatest human migration of the world. Wuhan, home of 11 million people -more London or New York - is also a knot in Chinese rail communications. Already this Thursday, in an unusual contrast, the shop windows of many establishments in the city look the typical decorations of these dates despite being mostly empty. therefore, the instructions of Zhong Nanshan, scientist who \nLead the team that tries to blow the coronavirus. \"From the moment in which the transmission between humans is tested [an extreme discarded up to this week], the quarantine should be the first priority,\" he said at a press conference held on Tuesday. Zhong, 84, is the highest Chinese eminence in infectious diseases and he jumped to Fame in 2002 by directing the government's response to SARS. This epidemic, also originated in China and that ended with the lives of 700 people around the world after becoming a global crisis, is marked in the memory of the population. \"Quarantine is the most effective measure because at the moment we have not developed a specific medication to deal with Coronavirus,\" the researcher sentenced. Another requirements established by the local authorities in Wuhan goes by making the use of masks in the public space. This object has become the first line of defense against the outbreak and nobody moves without it. In many of the supermarkets, on the other hand, perfectly stocked, the rack corresponding to the masks is empty. \"They have sold all, until those of the warehouse. I do not know when they will bring more, \"said the employee of a Qinghuang Street store, five kilometers from the center, protected with his. But before the growing number of cases, hospitals seem not to give supply. The newspaper News of Beijing reported that many of them are saturated with patients, some of which make queues on the outside despite low temperatures. The transfusion rooms are also crowded, and many patients crowd, connected to their droplets, in the hallway. \"My father has a high fever and respiratory problems since January 2. After several treatments did not work, last day the hospital informed us that they could not enter it because they did not have free beds. They transferred us to Wuhan Xinhua hospital and there \nNor could they take care of him. The condition of him has worsened, already has 12 days with high fever and every day he has to walk to the health center to give oxygen: without admission, without exams, without quarantine, \"he denounced a user at Weibo -Red Social Similar to Twitter. The arrivals area of \u200b\u200bWuhan Airport was deserted on Wednesday night. One of the last flights of the day barely transported two dozens of passengers, all protected with their mask. One of them was Xian Pin, 28, and employee of a financial firm, who was heading to the city because of a professional commitment. \"It is very important, if it were anything else it would not occur to me to have come. I have chosen to limit my trip to the fullest, so tomorrow I will fly back home. I am very worried, \"he pointed out. Given the taxation of the veto, it is most likely that Xian Pin has not achieved the purpose of him. On the same plane, the Lian stewardess shared that flights have experienced a remarkable decline in the number of passengers. She is from Wuhan, although she quoted a popular saying to illustrate her tranquility: \"Shi Fu Bushi Huo, Shi Huo Duo Bugo\", \"A blessing is not a curse, and a curse has no escape.\" On the outskirts of the airport, in which no exceptional security measures were seen, the driver Zheng Wang complained: \"I have stopped five hours, do not come passengers, so do not move.\" The son of him, 13, does not go to school since January 10 because the classes have been suspended. Asked about the credibility granted to the official figures of affected, he answers: \"That's better not to talk about.\" The government has threatened to punish anyone who contributes to expand rumors and local or regional administrations that make up reality. Despite his concern, Xian Pin was optimistic. he does not remember the epidemic of SARS because he \"was too small,\" but he is sure that on this occasion he will not be so \nserious. \"China is now a powerful country, and our leader Xi Jinping has addressed the people to ensure that our best minds are working on it. I trust that we will soon put the virus under control. \" "}, {"content": "COVID-19: How big is the risk in Germany?. With the surprisingly large Covid 19 outbreak in Italy, the concern is rising in front of new cases in Germany. Initially unnoticed infection chains are possible after expert assessment as well as in this country. This is known to the Virus SARS-COV-2 and the disease Covid-19 caused by him: How contagious is the new coronavirus? A value of how many other people infected in a resource is still not given to specify. It is clear that the virus is distributed by droplet infection - for example in coughing and speaking. And it is also clear that the pathogen is much more infectous than initially assumed: unlike the closely related SARS pathogens, the Covid 19 virus is also increasing in the throat area. In the upper respiratory tract, the contagion path is much shorter than when a pathogen must first come out of the lungs and into the lungs of another man. Also influenza viruses multiply in the throat. In addition, the first results indicate that the virus can also be spread over the digestive system and at least a few days over surfaces. An underestimated risk was possibly that in stool samples of patients in the initial phase of Covid-19-disease \"quite relevant quantities\" of SARS-COV-2 were detectable, about Clemens Wendtner, chief physician of infectious and tropical medicine at Munich Klinik Schwabing had , explained. To what extent also largely or very symptom-free people can be infectious is not yet clear. How big is the risk of infection in Germany? With the large number of proven infections in Italy, the risk of income from Covid-19 to Germany rises because of travel traffic. The risk that elsewhere in Europe could occur similar clusters as in Italy is currently considered to be high until highly high, it was on Sunday evening by the European Prevention Authority ECDC. once \nintroduced to the virus could quickly transfer. ecdc-directress andrea Ammon explained that they expect that it share in the coming days further falls in Italy and possibly other will give the eu. experts believe that there may be other infection chains in European countries long ago, of which so far no one suspects - even in Germany. \"At some point it will probably happen that undetected infections are suddenly noticed,\" had the Berlin virologist christian Drosten recently declared. What Would an eruption mean in Germany? an infection wave in this country could include full waiting areas and surgeries mean occupied intensively beds and completely overburdened health offices, said the Berlin virologist christian Drosten recently. the board of chef charit\u00e9, heyo Kroemer said mid february, was ready before consuming. the hospital system driving in winter under full load generally - would have in case of sars-cov-2 infections in this country the facilities but leeway, move for example through the non-urgent operations. the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) it was said that goal in Germany is to provide a disease-wave delay to avoid coinciding covid-19 and the current flu wave. \"We must with reasonable effort attempt to slow the propagation to an intense stress pulse mitigate the health system,\" said Drosten. \"The number of infections should be extended over the longest possible time.\" How dangerous is the virus? by a health authority of China easily analysis die in the country 2.3 percent of the infected with SARS-CoV-2. affected are therefore especially old people and those diseases cardiovascular-with serious underlying medical conditions such as diabetes or. years in people over 80 is the data from the present there calculated death rate of less than 15 percent, it \nSo, in this age group in China, the funds infected about 15 out of 100 in China. In the group of 10 to 39 years old people die 0.2 percent of the infected, ie about 2 out of 1,000 concerned. In the far vast majority of cases - the health authority, more than 80 percent - show people who have infected with the Covid 19 pathogens, only mild symptoms. Almost 14 percent of those affected therefore develop severe symptoms such as shortness, almost 5 percent life-threatening effects such as respiratory arrest, septic shock or multi-organ failure. The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) had spoken of more than 80 percent mild infection profiles with regard to the data analysis from China. There is also relatively few cases in children, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Be unclear why that was so. Experts assume that mortality is actually less than calculated in China, but because of many mildly infections in Chinese statistics are not collected. But secured analyzes for mortality from other countries do not exist so far. Which symptoms causes the new coronavirus? Many people have only a slight cold symptom with freasting and sore throat or no symptoms. Fever, cough and respiratory problems, as they also occur with a flu. Even headaches or diarrhea are possible. The incubation time - the period between infection and start of symptoms - is usually 2 to 14 days after the current level. This is the reason that suspected cases are isolated two weeks. How can the new lung disease be treated? There is no special therapy for the COVID-19 disease. Heavy-patients are treated symptomatically: with fever-lowering agents, the therapy of any bacterial additional infections and sometimes mechanical ventilation. Is there a protective vaccine? \nno. Several laboratories worldwide are currently researching vaccines as they also exist at the flu. The development of a vaccine takes a lot of time. The first experimental vaccines could give it this year, said the virologist Gerd Sutter from the Ludwig Maximilians University Munich recently. Whether and when they could be tested for people is another matter. \"The development of a vaccine is a lengthy, tedious process, especially the approval and the clinical examination of a candidate.\" Who-chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan believes that first vaccine testing could begin people in three to four months. A certified vaccine for far-reaching use is probably only available in 18 months. Do we already have a pandemic at Covid-19? Under a pandemic, the spread of a disease in humans is often understood over all continents. A region is considered \"affected\" when there are transmission chains there - and not only individual introductions through travelers. Messages on such infection chains are still missing from Africa and America. The question is, especially with certain African and South American countries, whether the virus is being tested and cases are recognized, the Berliner virologist Christian was declared. The World Health Organization (WHO) does not use the term pandemic and does not explain that either. The seriousness of a plague is only measured by the explanation of a \"inventory of international scope\". With the common definition of pandemic, this has nothing to do. What a virus is SARS-COV-2? Probably in November or December on a wildlife market in Wuhan in China on humans crossed pathogens SARS-2-COV is one of the coronaviruses. They are named so named because of the speck-like structures on their surface. Seven representatives of this group cause respiratory diseases in humans, such as \nAlso cold or coughing. SARS-COV-2 enclosed by three known that they sometimes cause severe symptoms. In the SARS virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome) also from China, around 8,000 cases were known in 2002/2003, about 800 people died. In 2012, the Mers virus (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) appeared in the Fort. It is less contagious, but more aggressive: from around 2500 infected until November 2019, almost 860 died - about every third. The Covid-19 pathogens SARS-COV-2 is genetically closely related to the SARS COVER SARS-COV, so he has also received the very similar expert name. How can I protect myself? To protect against this as well as other viruses, experts recommend ordinary hygiene measures: regular hand washing, disinfectant and distance to suffice. The benefits of normal breathing masks - as currently in China to see on the streets - appreciate experts as rather low. Of utilization may be to restrict hugs and shaking and shaking surfaces such as door tinkes, handles and lift buttons are not touched. What brings a mouthguard? \"Healthy people who are traveling in Germany do not need a mask,\" says a spokesman for the Federal Association of German Pharmacist Associations (ABDA). A simple mouth nose protection, as caregiver and physicians wear at interventions, do not shoot anyway from infectance with the new virus SARS-COV-2. There are also true respiratory protective masks with built-in filter. An infection by droplet transmission can also prevent only so-called FFP2 and FFP3 masks - if you are right. \"But in everyday life, that's nonsensical,\" said Bernd Salzberger from the University Hospital Regensburg, Chairman of the German Society for Infectiology. Especially since you can breathe hard with such a mask. Because of the novel coronavirus, protective masks have been sold out in many pharmacies - \nAnd they barely get replenishment. This explains the Federal Association of Pharmaceutical Wholesale (Phagro). When is tested on coronavirus? In the routine monitoring of acute respiratory diseases in Germany with the help of selected medical practices, attention is also paid to the novel coronavirus. As the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) in Berlin announced on Monday, the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Influenza (AGI) has integrated an investigation into SARS-COV-2 \"in the spectrum of the pathogens to be examined\". According to RKI information, respiratory samples are now analyzed by patients from 100 to 150 medical practices. Previously, the MDR had reported about the topic. For year-round monitoring by the AGI, among other things, the course and strength of respiratory diseases as well as characteristics of the circulating pathogens. On the basis of the sample of the participating medical practices, trends should be recognized. Priority is about the flu, at which every year thousands of people fall into Germany. Among other things, it is tested for rhinoviruses, which often stuck behind cold and colds. Where is there current information?

since it was reported in the chinese city of wuhan earlier this month.   here is what we know about the outbreak so far:   it is similar, but so far milder than sars   the pathogen appears to be a new strain of coronavirus, a family of viruses that can cause diseases such as the common cold and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars), which killed hundreds in mainland china and hong kong between 2002 and 2003.   it has been named \"2019-ncov\".   arnaud fontanet, head of the department of epidemiology at the institut pasteur in paris, told afp that the new strain was 80 per cent genetically identical to sars.   the symptoms caused by the new virus appears to be less aggressive as compared to sars, according to an afp report. these include fever, difficulty breathing and coughing.   however, its milder nature can also cause alarm as it allows more people to travel further before symptoms can be detected, the director of the institute of global health antoine flahault said.   suspected to have originated from animals, started at a seafood market in wuhan   the virus was first detected at a seafood market in the chinese city of wuhan, which has been shut down by authorities following the outbreak.      the market offered exotic wildlife for sale, including live foxes, crocodiles, wolf puppies, giant salamanders, snakes, rats, peacocks, porcupines, camel meat and other game, afp reported.   gao fu, director of the chinese centre for disease control and prevention, said authorities believe the virus likely came from \"wild animals at the seafood market\" though the exact source remains undetermined.   two studies from china indicated that bats are the likely origin, as the strain was found to be closely related to a strain that exists in the animal.   \"bats being the native host of the wuhan cov \n(coronavirus) would be the logical and convenient reasoning, though it remains likely there was intermediate host(s) in the transmission cascade from bats to humans,\" the researchers from several institutions in china wrote in a paper.   another study identified snakes as a possible intermediate host.   human-to-human transmission, not airborne but spread through water droplets   animals have been determined as the source of the virus, but human-to-human transmission of the virus is \"affirmative\", top chinese expert on infectious diseases zhong nanshan told state broadcaster cctv.   it has since been passed to people who have had no contact with the market where the virus first broke out.   doctor nathalie macdermott of king's college london told afp that it seems likely that the virus is spread through droplets in the air from sneezing or coughing.   there is currently no vaccine for the virus.   recommended protection   members of the public have been advised to take steps to prevent the spread of the virus. this includes wearing masks when experiencing respiratory symptoms such as coughing or sneezing, and observe good hygiene practices, like washing their hands frequently.   they should also avoid places and close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness.   singapore\u2019s ministry of health has issued an advisory asking travellers to avoid contact with live animals and consuming raw and undercooked meat.   those who are feeling unwell should also seek prompt medical attention, it added.      cities locked down in china   more than 800 people have been infected with the coronavirus in china, with at least 26 fatalities reported.      most of the patients came from wuhan, where the virus started. it has since spread to other major cities, such as beijing, shanghai and hong kong.   transport in and out of wuhan have ceased operations in an effort to prevent and control the spread of the virus.   authorities have also locked down several cities \nin hubei province as a response to the outbreak. entertainment venues such as shanghai\u2019s disneyland park, theatres and karaoke bars have also been closed down.   hubei province authorities also said they were calling off cultural performances and public cultural venues. travel agencies in the province have suspended business and the government has announced that refunds would be given to those who cancel transport tickets.   beijing has also cancelled chinese new year holiday gatherings at temples.   nine countries report cases,\u00a0including singapore   the first case of the virus reported outside of china was on jan 13, when a chinese woman was diagnosed with mild pneumonia after returning to thailand from wuhan. another case was confirmed in japan the next day.   so far, there have been confirmed cases in nine countries outside of china. thailand has the most reported cases, at four.   singapore reported its first case on jan 23 \u2013 a 66-year-old chinese man from wuhan who arrived in singapore on jan 20 and stayed at shangri-la\u2019s rasa sentosa resort.      he reported symptoms such as a sore throat and fever and went to singapore general hospital, where he was diagnosed with pneumonia and identified as a suspect case. he was confirmed to have been infected by the virus on jan 23.   contact tracing has been initiated to identify people who may have had close contact with the man. two other cases have since been confirmed, one of which is the man\u2019s 37-year-old son.   border screening has been implemented in several countries, including singapore, as a response to the outbreak.   budget carrier scoot has cancelled its daily flight to wuhan and

proteins.\nthat team hopes to make an rna vaccine based on one of the crown-like spikes on the surface of the coronavirus that gives the family of viruses their name, an approach that, unlike many vaccines, would not expose people to the virus.\nat the university of queensland in australia, scientists backed by the global health emergency group the coalition for epidemic preparedness

Last week, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Italy, Luigi di May, showed the arrival of a load of struggle against the new coronavirus sent by China. This week there was new loading for Italy, this time from Germany, shared by the Minister of Health, but had less attention. Recovering from Draconian quarantines and accelerated production, China is now heading to Europe, new epicenter of the pandemic, with a mixture of help and trade of products that serve for the protection and treatment of people infected with new coronavirus or patients With Covid-19 - after being greatly criticized by the initial management of the crisis. The country was already, before the pandemic, one of the leading manufacturers of surgical masks and respiratory protection. \"China's advantage in material help is increased because much of what the world needs to combat coronavirus is done in China,\" they say in an article in the Foreign Affairs Kurt M. Campbell, CEO of Asia Group (Consulting Group based in Washington), and Rush Doshi, Director of the China strategic initiative at the Brookings Institution Study Center (in the same city). \"Now through industrial mobilization as in war time, [Beijing] increased by more than ten times production, giving it the ability to make them available to the world,\" notice the two authors. The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said that the Chinese prime minister Li Keqiang agreed with the sending of two million surgical masks, 200,000 masks for respiratory protection and 500 thousand tests for the European Union. Von der Leyen said that the EU is increasing production, but it will take even until he can have the material ready. She also recalled that when China began to be achieved, the European Union sent more than 50 tons of protective equipment. \"China has not forgotten,\" and \"today we are in the center \nof the pandemic, and we are we need this equipment. \" This support for the European Union joins that China has not only given Italy as to other countries such as Spain or Belgium, and which also included sending doctors.

Chinese President Xi Jinping told the Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, who hoped to create a \"Health Silk Route\" in a reference to his new route project of silk, which has been seen with special distrust by some European countries , especially from the north. The head of the Spanish Government Pedro S\u00e1nchez, Xi said that \"after the storm comes the bonanza\", and that at this point the two should increase cooperation and trade. China's main strategy, writes the politician, is to show that \"the country that was the origin of the virus is now on the front line to try to save humanity, while the European Union can not act and the other superpower of the world is occupied pointing fingers \". They are real aid efforts, experts point out, noting that despite this they are not just altruistic and that political purposes also deserve attention. \"There is nothing bad in the fact that China help European countries, and others, especially now that he has gained an advantage for having contained coronavirus,\" said Noah Barkin, from the German Marshall Fund Study Center, the British Daily The Guardian. \"But it is also clear that [Beijing] sees this help as a propaganda tool.\" The greatest asset is the aid to European countries and, note the South China Morning Post, direct aid to the European Union marks a diplomatic difference in terms of actions with individual countries. Here, your attitude contrasts with the lowest solidarity of \nEuropeans, especially in relation to Italy, the first and most affected. and even more compared to the attitude of the United States, with the US President Donald Trump, trying to buy for the US the exclusive rights of a vaccine to be developed in Germany (the US denied this attempt, the German government confirmed), and to subject the Schengen space countries to a previous coordination entrance ban. \"While Trump reaches Europe with a prohibition of traveling, China is the generous and altruistic friend,\" says Barkin.

The aim is to limit the transmission between people, especially in the most vulnerable countries, as well as to identify, isolate and costly care for patients or to minimize economic and social impact. \"My biggest concern is in the countries that today do not have systems to work to detect people contagiented by the virus,\" said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \"Urgent support is required to strengthen health systems that detect, diagnose and protect more transmission between humans and health professionals.\" Tedros Adhanom Ghreyesus, WHO Director-General, also said that \"very soon\" a WHO team will go to China. \"The effectiveness of the response to the outbreak depends on the preparation measures,\" said Mike Ryan, director of the WHO emergency program. \"This is the reason we are looking for resources to safeguard the most vulnerable countries.\" One of the big questions is also the advancement in treatments for the new coronavirus. until \nNow there is no specific drug or virus vaccine. Due to some speculation about the development of new treatments, WHO made a point of reinforcing this week that \"there are still no effective therapies against this 2019-NCOV\" and that several experts meet this month to establish the priorities of these advances. Even though there is no specific treatment, the Chinese government has suggested antiviral drugs used to treat HIV, namely lopinavir and ritonavir, and inhalation of a nebulized interferon-alpha dose twice a day. The company Gilead Sciences is also testing an antiviral therapy for the ebola virus with patients infected by the new coronavirus. As for the vaccine, scientists in Australia developed a version of the cultivated virus in the laboratory, which can be an important step in the development of a vaccine. Also the alliance for readiness innovations for epidemics (CEPI) has already announced that three different research teams are developing vaccines and that the aim is to begin in June clinical trials. Russian Health Minister Mikhail Murashko also said this Wednesday that scientists in Russia expect to take at least between eight and ten months to develop a vaccine for the virus. \"Today the process of developing a vaccine is not done in a short period of time. A vaccine is being developed at at least eight to ten months, \"he said, quoted by the Russian news agency Interfax. Last week, Russia had announced that she was working on a vaccine with China. The choice of a new name for this virus - temporarily designated 2019-Ncov by WHO - may seem something smaller. \"The name [official] of the new virus is very delayed because the focus has so far been in public health response,\" says Crystal Watson, Johns Hopkins Center teacher for health security (US), quoted on the BBC website . However, there are some reasons that make \nChoosing the name become more priority. \"When we do not have an official name, there is the danger of people begin to use terms such as 'Chinese virus' and who can create a negative reaction against certain populations.\" The choice of name is by the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy (ICTV). According to the guidelines of the Committee, the name should not include geographical locations, names of people, the name of an animal or type of food, or references to a culture or industry. This name must be short and descriptive, such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). An ICTV group is already deliberating on the new name. Official names can also become a problem. In fact, in 2015, WHO criticized the Mers (respiratory syndrome of the Middle East), since it could lead to, for example, a negative reaction against members of religious and ethnic communities. There is still much to unravel about the virus, but one of the data they think is already acquired is what transmission can occur in the period before the manifestation of the symptoms. Initially, one of the strongest evidence in favor of this hypothesis came from a Chinese woman who had had a meeting in Munich: she would have infected other people and that she would only have had symptoms days later. This situation was published in the scientific journal The New England Journal of Medicine. However, the researchers were only based on the reports of the German patients. The Robert Koch Institute, the German Public Health Agency, and the Health and Food Authority of the State of Bavaria spoke with the Chinese patient and were now informed that she still had symptoms during her stay in Germany. Despite these new information, other data grounds the hypothesis that asymptomatic transmission occurs. This Wednesday was also announced the case of the younger person infected with the new coronavirus. The Chinese social media reported that a baby was diagnosed with the virus \nOnly 30 hours after being born, it refers to the English newspaper The Guardian. According to Chinese state television CCTV, the virus had been detected in the baby's mother before childbirth. This Wednesday was also more confirmed four cases in Singapore, including in a six-month baby. Still on the transmission of the virus, it came to be confirmed in the last week a doctor who launched an alert on coronavirus is also infected. The history of this physician ophthalmologist, Li Wenliang, began on December 30 when he wrote a message in his college group of friends. In this message, he meant that in his hospital they were seven patients with symptoms similar to those of SARS. He also asked that his friends and their families were careful. He subscribed for free newsletters and receive the best of the publicity and the deepest jobs of the public. As the message turned out to become viral, the police accused him of spreading rumors, which could take him to prison for seven years. According to the Spanish newspaper El Country, seven doctors received the same warning. The doctor ended up having to sign a statement in which he assumed his failure and promised not to do the same. A few days later, he ended up being infected by the new Coronavirus, after having dealt with a patient. The new coronavirus has not yet reached Africa, but African Disease Control and Prevention Centers have already activated its emergency operations center to address the virus and are organizing a workshop in Senegal to 15 African countries. An insulation wing is already ready at the Khartoum hospital in Sudan. Laboratories in Senegal, Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, Madagascar or Sierra Leone already have the necessary equipment to detect the virus. Passengers arriving at Cameroon or Gambia airports are being monitored for fever and other viral symptoms. The Democratic Republic of Congo has prevented its citizens from traveling for \nChina. Burkina Faso asked Chinese citizens to postpone their travels. Already Kenya, Rwanda and Tanzania have suspended flights to China.

time. \n they also found\u00a0that the two, who are married,\u00a0had a link with\u00a0another married couple from wuhan (cases 8 and 9) who had visited life church and missions singapore. both couples were there on the same day on jan 19. \n case 91, the wife,\u00a0developed symptoms on jan 23 and case 83, the husband, had symptoms on jan 28. \n on jan 25, both of them\u00a0attended a

suspect case at the time\u00a0because she had no recent travel history to china. the case definition has since been expanded to include those who have not been to\u00a0china in the last 14 days. \n on

it was a result of a sequential series of events, he\u00a0said at a media briefing on tuesday by the multi-ministry task force\u00a0managing the public health crisis. \n moh said that the spread between the clusters started with case\u00a08 (a 56 year-old woman) and case 9 (a 56 year-old man), who are chinese nationals.\u00a0 \n the couple arrived in singapore on jan 19 from wuhan, china \u2014 the epicentre of the outbreak.\u00a0\u00a0 \n they likely infected the singaporean couple who\u00a0went on to pass the infection to case 66 at the chinese new year gathering, the ministry said. case 66 later\u00a0passed the infection to his colleagues at grace assembly of god church. \n case 66\u00a0was thus found to be the primary case in the grace assembly of god\u00a0cluster.\u00a0 \n

"}, {"content": "big read: 17 years on, s\u2019pore puts sars lessons to test in fight against wuhan coronavirus. singapore \u2014 like many others on the frontline during the sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) pandemic in 2003, the resources of a family clinic in chua\u00a0chu kang had been stretched thin.   personal protective equipment \u2014 n95 respirators, sterile gloves and full-body gowns \u2014 was scarce at a time when the world had never seen a virus like it, and people everywhere were desperately scrambling to stockpile emergency supplies for themselves.\u00a0   speaking to today, dr tan tze lee, a general practitioner at the edinburgh clinic, recalled the difficulties that frontline healthcare workers faced when procuring equipment to protect themselves from the killer virus.\u00a0   by the time sars was contained in may 2003, it had infected 238 people and killed 33 in singapore. two in five of those infected had been healthcare workers.   while dr tan\u2019s clinic thankfully encountered no cases, it remained on high alert for sars patients in the four months of the epidemic in singapore, throughout which the medical staff had to don full protective gear. but everyone was not ready for the crisis, said dr tan, who is also president of the college of family physicians singapore.\u00a0   many continued to work but were extremely concerned that they might bring the virus home and put their loved ones at risk, he added.\u00a0   \u201cthe healthcare practitioners in singapore were ill-prepared, which resulted in sombre outcomes. since then, we have learnt our lesson and measures were instituted to prepare us for any future pandemic event.\u201d   \u201chere we are today, ready to fight the 2019-ncov,\u201d he said.   the current outbreak of the wuhan coronavirus \u2014 or 2019-ncov, the world health organization\u2019s (who) temporary name for the virus \u2014 was first confirmed in singapore on jan 23. to date, all cases were imported, including a singaporean who was in wuhan, and there has been no evidence of community spread in the republic. \nthe who has yet to declare the virus \u2014 which has spread to several countries \u2014 as a pandemic. nevertheless, it was declared a global health emergency on friday (jan 31).\u00a0   the first cases were reported in wuhan in china\u2019s hubei province and believed to be linked to the huanan seafood wholesale market, which sells live animals.\u00a0   as of noon on friday, there were 16 confirmed cases with the virus here, 35 cases were still waiting for their test results and 198 had already tested negative.\u00a0there are no deaths in singapore thus far.   at the heart of the city-state\u2019s response plan is the disease outbreak response system (dors), a crisis management plan which did not exist in 2003, but was drafted after sars and refined again in the wake of the swine flu (or h1n1) pandemic in 2009.\u00a0    medical workers conduct routine checks to guests\u00a0before the start of an nkf show at a mediacorp studio as a safety precaution against sars in 2003. today file photo   \u201cafter sars, we made a thorough review of the facilities we had \u2013 the infrastructure, hospitals, isolation wards, and the scientific testing and capabilities,\u201d said prime minister lee hsien loong at the sidelines of the world economic forum in davos, switzerland, last week.\u00a0   \u201ci think we are much better prepared now.\u201d\u00a0   currently, singapore is at dors condition (dorscon) yellow, signifying that the virus is severe and can infect from person to person, but is chiefly occurring outside singapore. the next step up is dorscon orange, which would have applied in the case of sars, whereby the virus is spreading in singapore but not widely, and is being contained.   while the plans are in place and some measures have kicked in, singapore\u2019s national strategy is still largely untested \u2014 since the wuhan coronavirus is believed to be in its early stages in the republic, medical experts and sars veterans told today.\u00a0   however, there are ample signs that the lessons from sars are being applied as singapore shores up its defences, \nthey said. they believe that unlike during\u00a0sars, singapore is far more ready now.   lessons learnt   singapore has had two brushes with pandemics in recent memory \u2014 sars and h1n1.   while singapore was able to contain and recover from both, the varying nature of the viruses, as well as the changes in medical science, meant that dealing with each required different approaches.   doctors had limited options when treating sars patients and could only administer supportive care, and there was nothing that could be done to prevent infection. in comparison, vaccines and treatment options were available when h1n1 claimed 18 lives in singapore and infected more than 400,000 people, out of which about 1,300 had to be hospitalised.   sars first arrived in singapore in late february 2003, and was detected in\u00a0a woman with an atypical pneumonia on march 1, 2003 at tan tock seng hospital (ttsh). at the time, no one knew how deadly and virulent it was and the first patient led to a cluster of 42 cases at the hospital.\u00a0   a ministry of health (moh) taskforce was set up on march 15, two weeks after the mysterious strain appeared in singapore and three days after the who issued a global alert on the outbreak that began in hong kong.   but the command and control structure then was \u201cwholly inadequate\u201d in a crisis situation that was both fluid and unprecedented, a study in the austrian journal of south-east asian studies concluded in 2012.    church goers being screened for their

of government agencies that did not fall under the rubric of the moh\u201d, said authors allen lai and tan teck boon, who were \nfrom the lee kuan yew school of public policy.   they noted that it took five weeks after the first case was reported for the bureaucracy to adapt, though by then, the outbreak had already spread quickly out of ttsh.\u00a0   on april 7, 2003, a national control structure was created in response to sars, comprising a nine-member inter-ministerial committee led by then home affairs minister wong kan seng to provide strategic and political directions during health crises.   helping to coordinate across silos were a core executive group of senior civil servants, and an operations committee spanning ministries. their functions were later consolidated during the h1n1 crisis, which meant that this leaner bureaucracy was quicker to respond to emerging situations on the ground.   with the wuhan coronavirus, observers told today that it was evident that the government had reacted more quickly than in sars and h1n1 when it came to establishing a multi-disciplinary decision-making body.\u00a0   professor ooi eng eong, an infectious diseases expert and virologist at the saw swee hock school of public health, noted that a multi-ministry taskforce on the wuhan coronavirus was formed on jan 22, several hours before the first suspected case came to the attention of the authorities at 10pm the same day. the patient \u2014 a 66-year-old chinese national tourist from wuhan \u2014 tested positive the next day, becoming the first confirmed case in singapore.   \u201cif you look at the response time, it is a fact that the ministerial committee formed before the case appeared, and we can see that a lot of systems are\u00a0already in place, occurring across ministries and not as siloed as back then when sars caught us all by surprise,\u201d said prof ooi, who is also deputy director of the emerging infectious diseases programme at duke-nus medical school.   the taskforce was formed to direct the whole-of-government response to the outbreak, coordinate the public\u2019s response and work with the international community.   jointly \nchaired by health minister gan kim yong and national development minister lawrence wong, the taskforce comprises a cross-section of cabinet ministers spanning various portfolios. they are:   adviser: deputy prime minister heng swee keat   mr s iswaran, minister for communications and information   mr chan chun sing, minister for trade and industry   mr masagos zulkifli, minister for the environment and water resources   mr ng chee meng, secretary-general of the national trades union congress   mr ong ye kung, minister for education   mrs josephine teo, minister for manpower and second minister for home affairs   mr desmond lee, minister for social and family development   dr janil puthucheary, senior minister of state for transport, communications and information   dr chia shi-lu, a tanjong pagar grc member of parliament who chairs the government parliamentary committee for health, said that this time, the chain of command is clearer.   he noted that even before the taskforce was formed, the moh had already begun tracking the outbreak in china at the start of the year. temperature screening measures were put in place at changi airport from as early as jan 3.   but the high political signature of the panel had led some to question whether too many cooks were spoiling the broth, dr chia noted. \u201cin fact, some have asked me: are we overdoing it?\u201d he said.\u00a0   \u201ci believe it is very important for everybody to come into the picture \u2014 you have to, because at this early stage, (the outbreak) affects so many different parts and you need leadership from them, and you cannot rely solely on moh to coordinate everything,\u201d he added.   while information about the wuhan virus is still emerging, singapore\u00a0is not in the same position as in the initial stages of the sars outbreak in 2003, where it was \u2014 in the words of then health minister lim hng kiang \u2014\u201cflying blind\u201d.\u00a0   during the sars crisis, singapore only had two means to detect those infected with the virus: their clinical \nsymptoms and their travel history. detecting these were not easy at the time as temperature screeners were also a rare resource, unlike today.   \u201cwe have to depend on people taking temperature, and we have to depend on people being truthful to us in their contact history,\u201d said mr lim then, describing sars as a tremendous challenge.   dr tan yia swam, first vice-president of the singapore medical association (sma), said that in the sars crisis, \u201cthere were too many unknowns, and precautions came too late, and too slowly\u201d. sars was zoonotic in nature, with the disease starting in animals before spreading to humans.\u00a0   as a result, policies and procedures regarding risk stratification, contact mapping, contact tracing, quarantine and others were developed on the fly as the epidemic erupted, she said.   \u201ctoday, all of the above have been developed and tested before in exercises and they are now put into action. of course, these plans, policies and procedures must be modified in line with the epidemiology of the disease, but we are not working from scratch, unlike the past experience with sars,\u201d she added.\u00a0    tan tock seng hospital's\u00a0moderate risk area during the 2003 sars period. today file photo     notices at tan tock seng hospital informing visitors and patients of the wuhan coronavirus. photos: raj nadarajan/today   addressing the media on monday, mr lawrence wong said that in the taskforce\u2019s national response to the virus, it is able to \u201cmarshal all available resources\u201d to tackle the scourge.   in terms of capacity, singapore has already beefed up its healthcare and isolation capacity since 2003. this includes the 330-bed national centre for infectious diseases that opened last year, and new hospitals such as khoo teck puat hospital in 2010, ng teng fong general hospital in 2015, and sengkang general hospital in 2018, he said.   during sars, ttsh was known as \u201csars central\u201d, the designated hospital to handle patients. this was borne out of a policy to restrict \ntransmission of the virus to other hospitals, after a patient \u2014 who was unaware that he had been infected with the virus during his stay in ttsh \u2014 created a new viral cluster at singapore general hospital (sgh) when he went there for a surgical problem after his discharge from ttsh.\u00a0   this policy changed in 2009 during the h1n1 outbreak, with the health ministry imposing a standardised infection control measure on all healthcare facilities, empowered by timely tweaks to the infectious diseases act. more than 400 family clinics were made \u201ch1n1-ready\u201d and equipped with the tamiflu vaccine to handle the outbreak.   similarly, all public hospitals are capable of handling the wuhan virus today, and come equipped with isolation rooms, which were in short supply in 2003.\u00a0   when it came to medical supplies, dr chia recalled how there was hardly a stockpile of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers then, such as n95 respirators.   \u201cbecause an n95 mask needs to fit well for it to perform its function, having a properly fitted mask was (hard to come by) during sars, and we had to find time to do the fitting too,\u201d said dr chia, who was an orthopaedic surgeon at sgh at the height of the crisis.\u00a0   \u201ctoday, most of us are already fitted with our own personal equipment, even as new staff. everything is in place today,\u201d he said.   visitors, staff and patients entering gleneagles hospital will have to undergo a screening at the entrance. photo: justin ong/today   for the general public, the government will be disbursing a pack of four surgical masks\u00a0to each of the 1.37 million singapore households in a one-off exercise between feb 1 and feb 9. this was also done in 2003 when all households received a free emergency kit, containing n95 masks and themometers.   this time round, the mask distribution comes amid long queues at pharmacies around the island as people clamour to buy masks, and retailers say their stocks of surgical masks and n95 masks are running low or sold \nout. the government had released 5 million masks from its stockpile over nine days to the retailers but they were all snapped up in hours.\u00a0   said dr chia: \u201cthe message is that there is enough for the whole of the population and in reserve too.\u201d   sma\u2019s dr tan said his association met with the college of family physicians singapore over the chinese new year weekend to carry out \u201ccomplex logistics arrangements\u201d to ensure that there is a steady supply of surgical and n95 masks to replenish stocks for the frontline healthcare workers.   \u201cwe are all monitoring the situation closely, and are ready to step up efforts when the need arises,\u201d he said.   experts noted that contingency plans have been put in place too \u2014 student hostels are converted into quarantine facilities in anticipation of future cases, and the outward bound singapore on pulau ubin has been marked as a possible quarantine site.    nanyang technological university's graduate hall 1, which is designated as a quarantine facility. photo: raj nadarajan/today   tricky balance in the face of imponderables   on monday, mr lawrence wong also called on singaporeans to be psychologically prepared that the wuhan virus could be worse than sars given the many \u201cimponderables\u201d and \u201cuncertainties\u201d regarding the infection, though he stressed that there is still no evidence of community spread of the disease in singapore.   over the past week, however, the first reports of human-to-human transmissions outside of china have surfaced in taiwan, japan, vietnam and germany.   mr lawrence wong said singapore\u2019s approach \u201cis to anticipate and move as swiftly as we can\u201d. \u201cbut every action we take really has to be based on evidence, data and international medical guidelines,\u201d he added.\u00a0   unlike sars, which impacted singapore when little was known about it, there is now a greater understanding about the coronavirus, a family of viruses that include the wuhan strain and sars.   but data gaps still exist, said professor tikki elka \npangestu, a visiting fellow at the lee kuan yew school of public policy and a former director of the who\u2019s research policy and cooperation department in geneva.\u00a0   prof pangestu told today that not much is known of the proportion of mild and asymptomatic cases versus the severe and fatal ones, which currently makes it difficult to evaluate the wuhan virus\u2019 true epidemic potential and complicates the outbreak response.   there is also the worry that the virus could mutate into a more virulent and more highly transmissible strain. \u201cthis needs close monitoring and another data gap will be in how quickly this development can be evaluated,\u201d he said.   despite these gaps, singapore has \u201creacted much more swiftly and comprehensively\u201d than in 2003, prof pangestu added.    with the evolving wuhan coronavirus situation, people are taking precautions to prevent the spreading of germs by wearing masks. photo: najeer yusof/today   a rule of thumb for any country\u2019s approach in health crises, he said, is to base decisions on scientific evidence and rational analysis in the context of its own capacities.\u00a0   \u201ci think the singapore approach is the correct one given the current information and evidence available \u2014 robust but not over-reactive and flexible enough to accommodate new developments,\u201d said prof pangestu.\u00a0   he noted that overreaction risks imposing an unjustifiable burden on the country, potentially impacting normal daily routines and the livelihoods of certain vulnerable segments of the population. underreaction, on the other hand, would lead to a more extensive spread of the virus.   \u201ccalibrating the balance is tricky, but as i said, base your decisions on the existing scientific evidence,\u201d said prof pangestu.   prof ooi from the saw swee hock school of public health added: \u201cthere is a risk and cost to overreaction and a cost to underreaction. nobody knows what is the right answer and there is no hard science to it \u2014 this is a judgement call and there is no right or \nwrong.\u201d   where there is a dearth of knowledge on imported pandemic cases, singapore\u2019s national strategy is flexible with the changing circumstances, and the plan recommends taking border control measures that would \u201cerr on the side of caution with more intense efforts until such time when the disease profile becomes clearer\u201d.\u00a0   addressing the media on friday, mr lee said: \u201ci think as a government, in a way, we are overreacting\u00a0because we are trying to look ahead to see what can go wrong and take preemptive steps to prevent that from happening.\u201d   within a week, the taskforce moved from allowing travellers from wuhan to enter singapore while subject to enhanced screening on monday, to imposing a complete entry ban on all nationalities who have been to china in the past 14 days on friday.   the immigration and checkpoints authority has also stopped issuing all forms of new visas to those with people\u2019s republic of china passports.   handling a psychological crisis\u00a0   although the memory of sars may have faded for some, experts say that the psychological lessons from it have remained until today, such that more singaporeans are aware of the need to cooperate with the authorities during a health crisis.\u00a0   for example, social media is rife with examples of singaporeans calling out bad actors, such as online sellers who hoard surgical masks to resell, or profiteering behaviour by certain businesses. the government has also acted quickly to combat such behaviour. \u00a0 but dr leong hoe nam, an infectious disease specialist at mount elizabeth novena hospital, believes that the sars legacy can also be a double-edged sword: the prospect of another sars-like epidemic might lead to needless panic, or worse, \u201ckiasuism\u201d.\u00a0    surgical masks sold out at guardian pharmacy at changi airport on jan 29, 2020.\u00a0photo: nuria ling/today   in a viral outbreak, being\u00a0 \u201ckiasu\u201d means that people only think for themselves, preventing mutual cooperation from happening, he said.   urging \nsingaporeans to do better, dr leong said they should be prepared for the viral outbreak but not overdo it. if fear and panic take hold, they can overwhelm the country\u2019s response \u201clike a tsunami\u201d, he said.\u00a0   this means singapore\u2019s national response has to preemptively address concerns that could lead to panic, he said.   \u201cyou have no time to get ready. better to be ready (for the worst) now than not ready at all\u2026 there is little room for mistakes (that create more panic),\u201d said dr leong.   dr chia believes that singaporeans are generally behaving in a rational way so far, based on his conversations with residents as an mp or his interactions with patients.   \u201cduring sars, there was a lot more fear and a sense of real danger for everyone. we had people trying to evade quarantine, refusing to cooperate or going for medical screening\u2026 but so far there are no cases of people who are trying to evade authorities, in other countries, yes, but not among singaporeans,\u201d he said.   the rise of social media, which was non-existent during sars, can also give rise to disinformation that fuels further panic.   on the threat of fake news, sma\u2019s dr tan said: \u201csocial media may do more harm than good in this kind of situation where fake news may spread faster than a virus and trigger unwanted behaviours. we urge all readers to exercise judgement when reading stories from various sources, and to keep referencing to official websites for accurate information.\u201d   stronger legislation\u00a0   compared with the sars crisis, singapore has more legislative levers now to deal with fake news and anti-social behaviour \u2014 the protection from online falsehoods and manipulation act being one of them.   lesser known are the many enhancements to the infectious diseases act over the years since 2003, which give the authorities greater powers to enforce orders that were issued in the fight against a gazetted outbreak.   the act allows people who break home quarantine orders to be arrested without a warrant \nand to be jailed or fined on conviction. it was amended last year to allow officers to use \u201cphysical means\u201d to enforce the order by bringing an absconder back to the place of isolation, in lieu of arrest.   it also makes explicit that persons under legal orders that restrict their movement in singapore, would not be allowed to leave the country, unless otherwise permitted.   the breadth of such powers in singapore gives the authorities the ability to ensure that evasion tactics, such as those described by dr chia, cannot happen again. the issue became such a problem during the sars crisis that the health authorities had to resort to draconian measures, such as installing video surveillance cameras in the homes of people who were ordered to be quarantined.\u00a0   the lack of legal powers has created some difficulties for several foreign governments in dealing with the wuhan coronavirus. earlier this week, two japanese citizens who were brought back to japan from wuhan on a chartered flight declined to go for medical screening when they landed in tokyo.   prime minister shinzo abe told the japanese parliament: \"while quarantine officers did their best to persuade them to go for further tests, they refused, and unfortunately there is no legal basis to force them to do so.\"   moral suasion and importance of public comms\u00a0   but over the longer term, evidence suggests that government measures such as quarantine and travel restrictions are not as effective as instilling a voluntary sense of social etiquette and responsibility among the people.   having a buy-in from the public is especially essential when the authorities need the people\u2019s support to carry out certain measures, noted prof pangestu.    \u200bpreschool children getting their health checked by teachers at my first skool at buangkok crescent on jan 28, 2020.\u00a0photo: nuria ling/today   prof pangestu said: \u201cyou need the public\u2019s cooperation for your measures to be successful, such as to follow good hygiene practices, be \nalert to any symptoms, promptly seeking healthcare, awareness of potential risks, and to counter the spread of misinformation on social media.\u201d\u00a0   this will be critical during the \u201csurge response\u201d\u2014 when situational changes cause a sudden need for the authorities to ramp up its measures, such as activating quarantine sites that are being held in reserve.   a lack of moral suasion would erase the ability for the government to implement these measures, experts said. they noted how in hong kong, protestors bombed a general hospital and a residential building that the authorities had wanted to use as a possible quarantine facility.   over the past week, south korean protesters \u2014 mostly residents \u2014 also used tractors to block access to facilities earmarked as quarantine centres in the cities of asan and jincheon, which are about 80km from seoul.   experts said cooperation from the masses largely relies on public education as well as proper and accurate communication of risk, which is not always a guarantee considering the complex flow of information in a crisis situation that can lead to miscommunication.\u00a0   an april 2003 article in the straits times,\u00a0\"all the right moves for sars but info\u2019s a bit slow, no?\",\u00a0by its then\u00a0news editor bertha henson, described how the moh was asked at a press conference to confirm a tipoff that sgh nurses might have sars. the authorities said no, but it later emerged the next day that 21 sgh staff were on the sars suspect list.   \u201cthe kindest thing i can say about this sudden announcement is that the ministry gets its information later than the media,\u201d wrote ms henson then.   referring to the incident, professor chee yam cheng, the current president of the singapore medical council, wrote in a series of memos about sars in 2003 that \u201cquick dissemination of information \u2014 and accurate information \u2014 is almost as important as transparency in a health emergency\u201d.   prof pangestu believes that in general, singaporeans are united and support what \nthe government is trying to do to contain the situation.   \u201cbut public reaction is hard to control especially with fake news on social media. the idea that \u2018perception is reality, anything is the truth\u2019 often operates in this kind of (crisis) environment. that is why public risk communication is so important,\u201d he said.

this is because it judges how likely something is based on how easy it is to think of examples \nof that thing happening.   we can think of many examples of fatal plane crashes because such incidents tend to be widely covered by the media.   but traffic accidents usually go unnoticed because they are an everyday occurrence and the media rarely covers them unless they involve multiple casualties or cause significant damage.   the influence of the availability heuristic was very apparent in another epidemic \u2014\u00a0the 2009 swine flu, caused by the influenza a h1n1 virus.   i was only 12 then, and i remember how the grownups, their eyes glued to the day\u2019s newspaper, spoke to one another in hushed tones about how bad the pandemic was and how many people were dying.   eventually, i caught the bug. but it was nothing a three-day stay in an isolation ward and a brief course of tamiflu couldn\u2019t fix.   h1n1 is still around today, but has faded into obscurity. it is now just another flu virus \u2014\u00a0one of dozens responsible for the seasonal flu.   of course, we now know that the 2009 variant of h1n1 was a relatively mild strain. it infected up to 200 million people but its mortality rate was a modest 0.02 per cent.\u00a0the mortality rate in singapore was even lower at 0.004 per cent, with 18 fatalities from some 415,000 cases.   it was a good illustration of how people\u2019s imagined fears, fuelled by media coverage, can make a relatively small problem seem like a huge one thanks to the availability heuristic.   it\u2019s hard not to overestimate your likelihood of dying from h1n1 if you\u2019re constantly reading reports about how thousands have already succumbed.   to put the numbers in context, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) viruses \u2014\u00a0which are cousins of 2019-ncov \u2014\u00a0have a 10 per cent and 34 per cent mortality rate respectively.   the mortality rate of 2019-ncov itself stands at below 3 per cent for now, though this could change if new information emerges about the virus or if it mutates into a more dangerous form.   meanwhile, the \nhumble seasonal flu sickens up to a billion people \u2014\u00a0equivalent to roughly 15 per cent of the world\u2019s population \u2014\u00a0every year, killing up to 650,000.   although this works out to a mortality rate of less than 1 per cent, the sheer number of cases means that even now, we are far more likely to come down with \u2014\u00a0and subsequently die from \u2014\u00a0the regular flu than the wuhan virus.   so if you see someone coughing, keep your mind in check. don\u2019t immediately assume that they have the wuhan virus. it\u2019s probably just the regular flu.   and when you are thinking and discussing with others about the outbreak, do your best to seek out the facts and use logical reasoning.   because the virus is new and little is known about it, people may fill the void of information with speculation and hearsay.   it has already happened here. fake news that individuals had died from the virus in singapore has circulated on at least two occasions, forcing the government to debunk the misinformation and even issue a general correction direction through the protection from online falsehoods and manipulation act\u00a0office.   it can be very tempting to share such rumours with family and friends, because they are dramatic and prey on our emotions.   but apply some media literacy techniques first, before deciding whether to press the \u201csend\u201d button.   read about past epidemics and how viruses work on free information platforms like wikipedia. consume news from multiple outlets so you can corroborate the facts across different sources.   as trade and industry minister chan chun sing said on jan 27 at a press conference about the wuhan virus situation in singapore: \u201cthis is not just a fight on the medical front, but a fight on the psychological front. we have to stay together, and do not panic.\u201d   in short, let\u2019s not scare ourselves unnecessarily, and refrain from scaring one another too.   \u00a0   about the author:   jonathan tiong is a fourth-year student at the national university of singapore where he is \nmajoring in communications and new media.

two-month lockdown in the city of wuhan where the new coronavirus is thought to have jumped from wildlife to people late last year.  \n but a study in the lancet public health journal suggested continuing wuhan's shutdowns until april would push a potential second wave of covid-19 - the disease caused by the new virus - until later in the year. that would give health services more time to

escalates. beijing/washington/new york - china is withdrawing the press credentials of american journalists at three u.s. newspapers, intensifying a bitter fight between the world's top two economies

revoking the accreditations of american correspondents with the new york times <nyt.n>, news corp's <nwsa.o> wall street journal and washington post whose credentials expire by the end of 2020.    the move is a sharp escalation of a dispute that saw washington last month force chinese state media firms to register as foreign embassies.    beijing then expelled three wall street journal correspondents - two americans and an australian - following an opinion column by the newspaper that called china the \"real sick man of asia.\"    washington then slashed the number of journalists permitted to work in the united states at four major chinese state-owned media outlets to 100, from 160 previously. it cited a \"deepening crackdown\" on independent reporting inside china.    beijing said the expelled journalists would not be permitted to work in mainland china, hong kong or macau. it said they must hand back their press cards within 10 days.    the expulsion is expected to affect at least 13 journalists, according to the foreign correspondents club of china, which said it \"deplores\" china's decision.    china's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment on how many journalists are affected.    beijing also said the china branches of the three papers plus the voice of america broadcaster and time magazine must \"declare in written form information about their staff, finance, operation and real estate in china.\"       war of words    the latest development follows a war of words between washington and \nbeijing over the outbreak of the new coronavirus, which causes a highly contagious, sometimes fatal, respiratory illness covid-19.    the virus originated in the chinese city of wuhan late last year and has so far killed 7,400 people globally, bringing normal life in many parts of the world to a standstill.    u.s. secretary of state mike pompeo told reporters at a state department news conference that beijing's move on wednesday would deprive the world and the chinese people of information in \"incredibly challenging\" times brought about by the coronavirus.    \"i regret china's decision today to further foreclose the world's ability to conduct the free press operations that frankly would be really good for the chinese people,\" he said. \"this is unfortunate... i hope they'll reconsider.\"    media executives denounced the move.    \"we unequivocally condemn any action by china to expel u.s. reporters,\" washington post executive editor marty baron said in a statement. \"the chinese government's decision is particularly regrettable because it comes in the midst of an unprecedented global crisis, when clear and reliable information about the international response to covid-19 is essential.\"    dean

commitment to reporting fully and deeply on china is unchanged.\"    time editor in chief and ceo edward felsenthal said: \"we oppose any effort by the chinese government or any other government to expel reporters or intimidate those whose job is to provide accurate information, especially during this crucial period for the world.\"    a representative of voice of america was not immediately

with their own media accreditation rules. in the past, foreign journalists kicked out of china were allowed to work in hong kong.    that raised questions about hong kong's autonomy under the \"one country, two systems\" agreement that still prevails between the territory and the mainland.    \"there's no precedent for china dictating who can and can\u2019t report from hong kong openly,\" said steven butler, the committee to protect journalists' asia programme coordinator. \"it very seriously erodes hong kong\u2019s autonomy and freedom of the press.\"    the foreign correspondents\u2019 club in hong kong said it was alarmed at the decision to expel the journalists and even more concerned that they would be banned from working as journalists in hong kong.    it said hong kong must provide assurances that foreign journalists working in hong kong and those applying to work in the city will continue to be issued employment visas without interference from the chinese government.    beijing said on wednesday that its actions \"are entirely necessary and reciprocal countermeasures that china is compelled to take in response to the unreasonable oppression the chinese media organizations experience in the united states.\"    pompeo said he did not think beijing's latest move was a balanced response. \"this isn't apples to apples,\" he said, charging that the chinese journalists who had faced restrictions were part of \"propaganda outlets.\"    china has repeatedly denounced the wall street journal's \"sick man\" column as racist and, after the newspaper declined

The propagation of Covid-19 and the imminence of a large pandemic can affect global geopolitics and is placing governments to social problems difficult to solve. Analysts heard by the Agency Lusa believe that a pandemic can create situations of \"pandemonium\" and emphasize that several rulers fear the social repercussion of the uncontrolled spread of the virus in a \"global village\" where phenomena do not recognize borders. A visible case of this concern is the US President: Worried about the impact of the new coronavirus in his re-election attempt in November near Trump prevented a US citizen who had been infected on the Diamond Princess ship in Japan to be treated In his home state of Alabama, phoning the Republican Senator Richard Shelby, to ensure compliance with his instruction. Analysts say that the impact of Covid-19 in US elections can be a \"double-edged knife\": In a first hypothesis, the US economy is affected in the long run, frailing the position of Trump, which has used the flag economic performance; In a second scenario, the outbreak has a short duration, affecting the production of goods for a few months, with the offer to resume on the eve of the election, in a compressed way, favoring the position of Trump. According to the North American newspaper, Trump already asked its advisors to analyze all the scenarios and requested a detailed report on emergency measures to the control and disease prevention center (CDC). The CDC, in a document made public, warned the American president on the risk of \"the public health system to stay overwhelmed, with high hospitalization rates and deaths,\" alerting also for the impact of a pandemic in transport systems. the problem is global and the great variable is to know what dimension he will reach, says Jos\u00e9 Pedro \nTeixeira Fernandes, researcher at the Portuguese Institute of International Relations (IPRI-Nova). In statements to Lusa, this specialist alerts to the risks that governments run if a pandemic spreads for long periods of time. \"The problem is grade,\" explains Teixeira Fernandes, referring to a situation that can involve many thousands of infected one country for a long period, affecting not only health services, but also the supply chains of goods essential. For already, in Europe, where cases of infection begin to multiply in various regions, governments seek containment mechanisms of the disease, triggering administrative virus insulation mechanisms. Even in France, where there is a strong tradition of individual rights - which make it impossible for, for example, that a person who decides to disappear can not be sought by the police, even under the pretext of \"family interest\" - the government announced that it will carry out the obligation to Internment for infected people. The theme of mandatory hospitalization of an infected patient with a highly contagious virus is being discussed in several countries, including Portugal, where specialists are divided into the legal reading of solutions. Constantine Sakellarides, a public health specialist and who was responsible for the General Health Directorate in Portugal, stated that Portuguese law enables a compulsory quarantine of a patient infected with viruses and even provides for the possibility of declaring the state of calamity, which be proposed by the Government to the President of the Republic. In contrast, Francisco George, who was also General Health Director, considers that it will be necessary to make amendments to the Constitution to establish compulsory hospitalization for public health reasons. \"In Portugal, it is the height of Members of the Assembly of the Republic to amend Article 27 (3) (h) of the Constitution, in order to be allowed to \nrequired for public health reasons. Inadadiatico, \"wrote Francisco George, in a recently released opinion article in the public diary. Caroline Barnett, a public health professor at the University of Paris, says that the risk of this gender measures increases with the size of the problem.\" The problem is when the State seeks mandatory hospitalization for hundreds or thousands of people, often without ensuring the appropriate conditions for all these hospitalizations, \"said Barnett to Lusa, referring to a scenario that may occur in several countries in the short term. for this specialist , an uncontrolled situation of virus propagation can lead to a political \"pandemonium\", with several governments to recognize the inability to deal with thousands of dead and deficit health systems in the media to welcome millions of infected. In Europe, the Commission, Europe seeks less intrusive solutions than compulsory hospitalization, with mechanisms of virus propagation isolation that avoid the need for internal Compulsive, in particular by activating the \"pool\" of European civil protection - an organization established to streamline a coordination of efforts between member countries for rapid response to catastrophes. A relevant political decision in the European Community concerns the closure of borders in the Schengen area, which the European Commission said this week is not yet being considered. The European Commissioner for Health and Food Security Stella Kyriakides said that the World Health Organization did not advise restrictions in Europe to justify the removal of this solution. Jos\u00e9 Pedro Teixeira Fernandes Remember that a measure of this genre goes against Schengen's own spirit, but recognizes that an emergency situation can justify it for a short period of time. The governments of Italy and France, whose countries border, have announced that they are attentive to this possibility, after the provinces \nItalian of Lombardy and Veneto is strongly affected by seeing propagation of new coronavirus. moreover, the Italian Prime Minister, Giuseppe tell, has been criticized by the regional authorities for more relaxed way it has addressed the issue of the coronavirus, criticizing even closures of local decisions in schools and other public spaces. Tell tried to allay fears that his government was not able to contain the virus, after being forced to admit that a hospital in northern Italy had poorly handled a case of infection, contributing to the spread of covid-19. politically the most sensitive border is what separates Italy from Austria, two countries that are in open confrontation around the discussion of the EU budget and that also seem to have different views on the best way to contain the coronavirus. the Austrian government has given signs that would like to see the borders better monitored, but the Italian government has said it sees no reason to suspend schengen, asking the European Commission to quickly release the fund of EUR 232 million to contain the spread of Covid-19. diplomatically, the problem is also used as a pretext to regulate the increasing flow of Chinese tourists in some Asian regions. the singapore authorities are fighting the Chinese to the territory, after the minister of business and industry of this territory have announced that the tourism sector was overly dependent on China, using the protective measures against the virus to justify measures medium and long term in moderating its entry. Teixeira Fernandes points out that the case covid-19 is a major threat to China's position, initial focus of the epidemic at the moment is to launch its program for economic expansion, particularly against the United States, with which it has a trade war almost two years ago. the expert of the New IPRI still remember another case of a country in conflict \nWith the United States, Iran, which is also arms with a serious problem of spreading the virus, which will also be fragile to its enemies.

Unlike several countries, namely European, Portugal has not provided for an automatic quarantine for repatriated citizens due to the outbreak of coronavirus - which would be unconstitutional, because it is only foreseen for cases of the psychiatric forum. In Germany, Spain, France and the United Kingdom The measure is expected, if necessary for 14 days, the incubation period of the disease until the appearance of the first symptoms. In Spain, for example, the \"El Country\" has already advanced that Quarantine will be fulfilled at Central Hospital G\u00f3mez Ulla in Madrid, where a full floor is booked. In the UK, Matt Hancock, the Secretary of Health has already warned: \"Public security is our priority.

In view of the progression of the epidemic, it was already last week that the Directorate-General Health appointed the hospitals of St. John in Porto and Curry Cabral and Estef\u00e2nia in Lisbon as the destinations for infected potentials. The liability of hospitals only occurs with the arrival of patients to the hospital unit. \" patients (suspected or confirmed cases) should be \nMade by INEM, which has the appropriate means, \"explains the Hospital of St. John.

From the Curry Cabral, in Lisbon, the information is the same. Expresso, Fernando Maltez, director of the infectious disease service, reinforces that the contingency plan already elaborated will be applied only to infected persons or suspected infection. This plan \"contemplates the isolation of these people in their own rooms in the service of infectious diseases.\" In this sense, \"14 negative pressure respiratory insulation\" were available, used to welcome patients with infectious diseases. But as the contingency plan was \"prepared to ensure the safety of both patients, both health professionals,\" other measures are planned, such as the existence of \"distinct\" passing circuits and the delivery of \"personal protective equipment\", such as \"beats, gloves, masks, glasses and caps\". It is all posts, including with regard to \"therapeutic and diagnostic methods to be implemented,\" says Fernando Maltez. In the case of the S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Hospital, Porto, the Prevention Plan - which will be updated \"as knowledge of the evolution of the epidemic\" - contemplates \"physical spaces and means\" specific that are allocated to this answer. This includes doctors, whose number depends on the amount of \"suspicious or confirmed cases\" that are referred and their characteristics, \"namely if adults or children and degree of gravity.\" Similar to what will happen at Hospital Curry Cabral, Hospital health professionals in Porto that \ncare for these patients will have to use \"appropriate personal protective equipment to the type and risk of transmission of this agent\" that, \"depending on the activity that is exercising\", will pass through the use of \"masks, bats, gloves and eye protection ( glasses or visors). Although the plan is specific - for being a new virus and, as such, with \"own characteristics\" -, the S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Hospital admits that there are points of contact with previous diseases such as bird flu or flu a. \"There are naturally similarities with previous emerging diseases in the way it is transmitted, as is given the evolution of epidemic and in terms of public health and control measures,\" admit. Fernando Maltez adds that Curry Cabral already \"activated several contingency plans for other threats of infectious diseases\" and that these plans \"are being modified and updated\" with changes to the level of personal protective equipment, as happened with the Ebola outbreak which originated in the Democratic Republic of Congo, \"which is transmitted by contact with any organic fluid\" and not \"only by respiratory route\", as in the case of coronavirus. As for the precautions to be taken, the specialist states that they are the same as in a case of influenza, including for the people living with the Portuguese who will be removed from Wuhan - everything indicates that this Friday - and placed under surveillance at home for a period of 14 days, through a case-by-case analysis. \"These citizens do not need to stay home alone, being able to live with family and friends since they use mask and lay their hands. Those who live with them also have to do the same, \"he said.

drive growth in the upcoming fiscal, it says the output gap remains negative in the present scenario due to a mix of domestic and global economic factors. while rbi did not opt for a rate cut,

remain worried about inflation, especially since demand for food commodities have increased globally after the coronavirus outbreak. rbi has projected cpi inflation upwards to 6.5 per cent for the present quarter and 5.4 per cent for the first half of fy21, which is expected to go down to 3.21 per cent in the third quarter of fy21. while inflation projection has been increased from the earlier

its policy stance should not be seen as a future policy action and that it has many ways of tackling economic growth when required. shaktikanta das said rbi will continue to maintain an accommodative stance, indicating that it will act whenever necessary to beat slowdown. have many \ninstruments at our disposal to address slowdown, das said. small saving schemes interest rates  the rbi\u2019s mpc

production of vegetables was also estimated to go up by 2.6 per cent, as per the mpc. this is a good indication as it could lead to moderation in the prices of vegetables. better indicators  while there are some existing factors that need to be addressed, rbi said there has been an improvement in industrial activity. the nikkei india manufacturing purchasing managers' index (pmi), prepared by

administration eliminated a key american public health position in beijing intended to help detect disease outbreaks in china, reuters has learned. the american disease expert, a medical epidemiologist embedded in china\u2019s disease control agency, left her post in july, according to four sources with knowledge of the issue. the first cases of the new coronavirus may have emerged as early as november, and as cases exploded, the trump administration in february chastised china for censoring information about the outbreak and keeping u.s. experts from entering the country to help. \u201cit was heartbreaking to watch,\u201d said bao-ping zhu, a chinese american who served in that role, which was funded by the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention, between 2007 and 2011. \u201cif someone had been there, public health officials and governments across the world could have moved much faster.\u201d zhu and the other sources said the american expert, dr. linda quick, was a trainer of chinese field epidemiologists who were deployed to the epicenter of outbreaks to help track, investigate and contain diseases.  as an american cdc employee, they said, quick was in an ideal position to be the eyes and ears on the ground for the united states and other countries on the coronavirus outbreak, and might have alerted them to the growing threat weeks earlier. no other foreign disease experts were embedded to lead the program after quick left in july, according to the sources. zhu said an embedded expert can often get word of outbreaks early, after forming close relationships with chinese counterparts. zhu and the other sources said quick could have provided real-time information to u.s. and other officials around the world during the first weeks of the outbreak, when they said the chinese government tamped down on the release of \ninformation and provided erroneous assessments. quick left amid a bitter u.s. trade dispute with china when she learned her federally funded post, officially known as resident adviser to the u.s. field epidemiology training program in china, would be discontinued as of september, the sources said. the u.s. cdc said it first learned of a \u201ccluster of 27 cases of pneumonia\u201d of unexplained origin in wuhan, china, on dec. 31. since then, the outbreak of the disease known as covid-19 has spread rapidly worldwide, killing more than 13,600 people, infecting more than 317,000. the epidemic has overwhelmed healthcare systems some countries, including italy, and threatens to do so in the united states and elsewhere. in a statement to reuters, the u.s. cdc said the elimination of the adviser position did not hinder washington\u2019s ability to get information and \u201chad absolutely nothing to do with cdc not learning of cases in china earlier.\u201d the agency said its decision not to have a resident adviser \u201cstarted well before last summer and was due to china\u2019s excellent technical capability and maturity of the program.\u201d the cdc said it has assigned two of its chinese employees as \u201cmentors\u201d to help with the training program. the agency did not respond to questions about the mentors\u2019 specific role or expertise. \u201ccdc has had a 30-year partnership with china cdc and close collaboration,\u201d the statement said. \u201cwe had the right staff to engage china and ability to provide technical assistance were it requested.\u201d the cdc would not make quick, who still works for the agency, available for comment. asked for comment on chinese transparency and responsiveness to the outbreak, china\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs referred reuters to remarks by spokesman geng shuang on friday. geng said the country \u201chas adopted the strictest, most comprehensive, and most thorough prevention and control measures in an open, transparent, and responsible manner, and informed the (world health organization) and relevant \ncountries and regions of the latest situation in a timely manner.\u201d one disease expert told reuters he was skeptical that the u.s. resident adviser would have been able to get earlier or better information to the trump administration, given the chinese government\u2019s suppression of information. \u201cin the end, based on circumstances in china, it probably wouldn\u2019t have had made a big difference,\u201d scott mcnabb, who was a cdc epidemiologist for 20 years and is now a research professor at emory university. \u201cthe problem was how the chinese handled it. what should have changed was the chinese should have acknowledged it earlier and didn\u2019t.\u201d alex azar, secretary of health and human services (hhs)said friday that his agency learned of the coronavirus in early january, based on redfield\u2019s conversations with \u201cchinese colleagues.\u201d redfield learned that \u201cthis looks to be a novel coronavirus\u201d from dr. gao fu, the head of the china cdc, according to an hhs administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \u201cdr. redfield always talked to dr. gao,\u201d the official said. hhs and cdc did not make azar or redfield available for comment. zhu and other sources said u.s. leaders should not have been relying on the china cdc director for alerts and updates. in general, they said, officials in china downplayed the severity of the outbreak in the early weeks and did not acknowledge evidence of person-to-person transmission until jan. 20. after the epidemic exploded and china had imposed strict quarantines, trump administration officials complained that the chinese had censored information about the outbreak and that the united states had been unable to get american disease experts into the country to help contain the spread. azar told cnn on feb. 14 that he and cdc director redfield officially offered to send a cdc team into china on jan. 6 but still had not received permission for them to enter the country. hhs oversees the cdc. \u201cdr. redfield and i made the offer on january 6th - 36 days \nago, 60,000 cases and 1,300 deaths ago,\u201d azar said. \u201cwe made the offer to send the cdc experts in to assist their chinese colleagues to get to the bottom of key scientific questions like, how transmissible is this disease? what is the severity? what is the incubation period and can there be asymptomatic transmission?\u201d days later, the world health organization secured permission to send a team that included two u.s. experts. the team visited between feb. 16th and 24th. by then, china had reported more than 75,000 cases. on feb. 25, the first day the cdc told the american public to prepare for an outbreak at home, u.s. secretary of state mike pompeo accused china of mishandling the epidemic through its \u201ccensorship\u201d of medical professionals and media. relations between the two countries have deteriorated since then, as trump has labeled the coronavirus the \u201cchinese virus\u201d - a description the chinese have condemned as stigmatizing. last week, the chinese government announced that americans from three u.s. news organizations, the new york times, washington post and wall street journal, would be expelled from china. the decision to eliminate quick\u2019s job came as the cdc has scaled back the number of u.s. staffers in china over the last two years, the sources told reuters. \u201cwe had already withdrawn many technical public health experts,\u201d  the same expert said. the cdc, however, disputed that staffing was a problem or that its information had been limited by the move.  \u201cit was not the staffing shortage that limited our ability\u201d it said. the u.s. cdc team in beijing now includes three american citizens in permanent roles, an additional american who is temporary and around 10 chinese nationals, the agency said. of the americans, one is an influenza expert with expertise in respiratory disease. coronavirus is not influenza, though it is a respiratory disease. the cdc team, aside from quick, was housed at u.s. embassy facilities. no american cdc staffer besides quick was embedded \nwith china\u2019s disease control agency, the sources said. china in recent weeks has reported a dramatic slowdown in new cases, the result of drastic containment measures including the lockdown of hubei province, home to 60 million people. nevertheless, the infectious disease experts who spoke with reuters said, the united states could use people like quick with contacts on the ground, especially if fears of a second wave of infections materializes. thomas r. frieden, a former director of the cdc, said that if the u.s. resident adviser had still been in china, \u201cit is possible that we would know more today about how this coronavirus is spreading and what works best to stop it.\u201d dr. george conway, a medical epidemiologist who knows quick and had served as resident advisor between 2012 and 2015, said funding for the position had been tenuous for years because of a perennial debate among u.s health officials over whether china should be paying for funding its own training program. yet since the training program was launched in 2001, the sources familiar with it say, it has not only strengthened the ranks of chinese epidemiologists in the field, but also fostered collegial relationships between public health officials in the two countries. \u201cwe go there as credentialed diplomats and return home as close colleagues and often as friends,\u201d conway said. in 2007, dr. robert fontaine, a cdc epidemiologist  and one of the longest serving u.s. officials in the adviser\u2019s position, received china\u2019s highest honor for outstanding contributions to public health due to his contribution as a foreigner in helping to detect and investigate clusters of pneumonia of unknown cause. but since last year, frieden and others said, growing tensions between the trump administration and china\u2019s leadership have apparently damaged the collaboration. \u201cthe message from the administration was, \u2018don\u2019t work with china, they\u2019re our rival,\u2019\u201d frieden said. the white house did not immediately respond to a request \nfor comment.

The second world power thus fulfills the conditions of the commercial truce signed with Trump in January. Meanwhile, Washington is prepared to adopt reciprocal measures. The decision arrives at a time of tension between the two countries after China protested by the US reaction to the Coronavirus epidemic.\nThe trimming will apply to tariffs imposed from last September 1 on 1,600 products such as soybeans, seafood, poultry or tungsten lamps for medical research. After this decision, 10% rates will go to 5%, and those that were at 5% will be cut by 2.5%.\nThe announcement arrives a month after the president of the United States, Donald Trump, and the Chinese Deputy Prime Minister Liu He, signed in Washington the truce in the commercial war that both countries for almost two years ago. Among other commitments, China agreed to increase its purchases from US products in about 200.00 million dollars in the next two years. But after that agreement the confrontation between the two powers grew.

After the disclosure of new infection detections with the Coronavirus SARS-COV-2, hope has been fell to keep the lung disease from Germany. What is done to narrow the spread and what is known about the virus and the disease? According to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), a further import of cases to Germany must be expected. Other transfers of SARS COV-2, infection chains and outbreaks in the country are possible. Local infections could initially remain unrecognized, said Vice President of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), Lars Schaade, on Wednesday in the RBB. It is \"quite possible that we do not recognize all these outbreaks immediately\". It is necessary to expect that thereby coming to another spread. The risk to the health of the population in Germany currently appreciate the experts as low to moderate. An infection wave in this country could include full waiting areas and medical practices, intensive care beds and fully overloaded health insurance offices, the Berlin virologist Christian had recently explained. As a problem, experts see that the annual influenza wave is currently rolling through Germany - and the health system already stressed heavily. For this reason, it is the goal of delaying the spread of the coronavirus as far as possible as the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) recently explained. \"We have to try adequate effort to slow the spread to mitigate an intense stress pillar on the health system,\" said Road. \"The number of infections should be extended for a long time as possible.\" A value of how many other people infected in a remedy can still be notified. The virus spreads by droplet infection for about coughing and talking. First results indicate that the \nVirus can also be distributed over the digestive system and at least a few days over surfaces. An underestimated risk was possibly that in stool samples of patients in the initial phase of Covid-19-disease \"quite relevant quantities\" of SARS-COV-2 were detectable, about Clemens Wendtner, chief physician of infectious and tropical medicine at Munich Klinik Schwabing had , explained. That's still a difficult question. For a final assessment of the severity of the new respiratory disease, there are currently not enough data, says something the RKI. According to a recent analysis of Chinese's Health Authority, 2.3 percent die in the country infected with SARS COV-2. Above all, old people and those with severe pre-conditions such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes are concerned. For people over the age of 80, the death rate calculated from the data available there is almost 15 percent, so in this age group in China dies about 15 out of 100 infected in China. In the group of 10 to 39 years old people die 0.2 percent of the infected, ie about 2 out of 1,000 concerned. Experts assume that mortality is actually less than calculated in China, among other things, because in Chinese statistics many mild extensive infections are not collected at all. But secured analyzes for mortality from other countries do not exist so far. Most people have only a slight cold symptom with freasting and sore throat or no symptoms. Fever, cough and respiratory problems, as they also occur with a flu. Even headaches or diarrhea are possible. According to the Chinese Health Authority, it comes with more than 80 percent of the infected to mild infection processes, almost 14 percent of suffering difficulty. At just under five percent, it comes to life-threatening effects such as respiratory arrest, septic shock \nor multi-organ failure. The incubation time - the period between infection and start of symptoms - is usually 2 to 14 days after the current level. This is the reason that suspected cases are isolated two weeks. There is no special therapy for the COVID-19 disease. Heavy-patients are treated symptomatically: with fever-lowering agents, the therapy of any bacterial additional infections and sometimes mechanical ventilation. In individual cases, antiviral drugs are also tested. no. Several laboratories worldwide are currently researching vaccines as they are available for the flu. The development of a vaccine takes a lot of time. WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan believes that first vaccine testing could start people in three to four months. A certified vaccine for far-reaching use is probably only available in 18 months. The US biotech company Moderna had reported on Monday, developed a vaccine candidate and delivered to the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NiaID). Its director Anthony Fauci announced according to CNN's first clinical trials for the end of April. He, too, expected it to take one to one and a half years before a vaccine is available. To protect against this as well as other viruses, experts recommend ordinary hygiene measures: regular hand washing, disinfectant and distance to suffice. The benefits of normal breathing masks - as currently in China and other countries to see on the streets - appreciate experts as rather low. It can help to restrict hugs and shaking hands and suggested by many people, such as door tinkers, handles and elevator buttons do not touch. Basically, it is unclear how long the virus survives on surfaces, the World Health Organization WHO says. Studies suggested that there are a few hours or days \nbe - depending on conditions such as surface, temperature or moisture. The likelihood that an infected goods contaminated with the virus is classified by the authority as low. The risk that a recipient is indicated by a packet exposed on the transport of different conditions and temperatures is low. Imported foods and goods such as toys, computers or clothes are also unlikely as infection sources, says the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment. Experts emphasize how important it is to observe general hygiene rules, so about washing their hands regularly. If you had contact to an infected, according to RKI, you should first report to his health department, regardless of whether symptoms have occurred or not. Travelers from risk areas that have symptoms should consult a doctor after telephone reservation with reference to the journey.

Even \"disease suspects\" and \"infectual suspect\" - as the law expresses it - could be imposed on a professional ban. To protect others, people could also \"be separated in a suitable hospital or otherwise suitably\", it says in the law. "}, {"content": "There are no marriages or funerals.

Since then, almost every day there is someone who criticizes the newspaper because he believes that exaggerates the problem. others say the opposite. the controversy does not end despite the own newspaper has publicly called for caution and restraint. the problem of the new virus was identified on December 16 at a hospital in Wuhan (China), but Beijing did not inform the World Health Organization (WHO) until 31 December. Ten days later, the country published on the web the first information with this headline: a virus similar to SARS, responsible for the mysterious pneumonia in China. The text indicated that there were 59 people infected, but no deaths. comparison with SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), which caused 774 deaths in 2002 and 2003, provoked the first criticism. This one reader commented on the web: \"Come, alarmed. 59 affected by pneumonia at best, zero dead \". other replied, \"as it is for alarm. If the virus comes from an animal (as people think), there is a serious public health problem that can cause an epidemic. \" It was the beginning of a debate that fired when the newspaper began publishing the issue in its print edition from January 17. the headline on page 26 of that day was: who monitors the progress of the virus discovered in China and detected in two other countries. By then, the disease had claimed one fatality. and two more on the 20th, when the header on the web was this: the deadly virus spreads Wuhan China. pedro bra\u00f1as reader told me by mail that he seemed \"unacceptably alarmist\". \"I do not think a responsible owner for \nSerious newspaper \". Seven days later, the infected were already 4,400 in a score of countries - the majority in China, but the infection had already arrived in Europe - and the death number exceeded the hundred. Even so, some readers maintained critical positions such as: \"This strange virus has all means of communication by putting the population on emotional alert as if it were the epidemic of the end of the world\"; \"Alarmism, you have to sell\"; \"This punctual retransmission of each case only serves to transmit paranoia and alarmism.\" Several readers wonder why the newspaper narrates this infection and not the serious effects of influenza. In the 2018-2019 season, recalls c.f., the flu cost the life in Spain to 6,300 people. Oriol G\u00fcell, a health specialist and signatory of various information about the Coronavirus, maintains that the newspaper is covered with amplitude, but also with prudence, \"an information of great scientific and medical relevance and, therefore, of undoubted interest to readers\" . Between 20 and 27, two news about the Coronavirus were among the ten most read about the newspaper and 30 was the most often when the WHO declared the international alert. \"We do not know the magnitude that this epidemic will have and report its evolution day by day is an inescapable obligation of the media,\" says G\u00fcell. He adds that the common flu (such as tobacco, traffic or suicides) causes thousands of deaths a year, but \"are already known phenomena,\" while the Wuhan Coronavirus \"is something new to still unpredictable consequences.\" To justify such coverage (half hundred texts in 15 days), G\u00fcell recalls that the magnitudes of this infection have no precedents: 10,000 infected in 25 countries (Spain included) and more than 200 killed in a month, confinement of 56 million people In 13 Chinese cities, global stock impacts, prevention measures in thousands of airplanes and airports, repatriations of \nForeigners ... Objective data Support that the newspaper behavior has not been excessive. The country only addressed the issue when there was evidence of the severity of the case: on January 9 on the web and 17, on paper. Until 21, no call on first page appeared and on 24 was, for the first time, the main news with an informative, not alarmist holder: China isolates 21 million people to stop the expansion of the virus. Even the newspaper published an editorial on day 29 entitled weight, in which he said: \"You have to maintain an attentive surveillance, but without falling into alarmisms that can aggravate the consubstantial damage to an epidemic of this nature.\" As the Economist pointed out, \"the world is better prepared than ever to stop the Wuhan Coronavirus.\" Thus, because governments - Chinese, the first - and health authorities have learned from serious mistakes of the past. Saving the differences, also the newspapers, and among them the country, have learned from the mistakes of the past. -------- Email: Defender@elpais.es Web: The defender of the reader answers you can follow the country review on Facebook, Twitter or subscribe here to the Newsletter. "}, {"content": "economist who counted $54.5 billion sars cost sees bigger hit from wuhan virus. sydney (bloomberg) - the global cost of the coronavirus could be three or four times that of the 2003 sars outbreak that sapped the world's economy by us$40 billion (s$54.5 billion), according to the economist who calculated that figure. \n the sheer growth in the chinese economy over the last 17 years means the global health emergency triggered by the coronavirus outbreak, which originated in wuhan, has far greater potential to gouge global growth, according to warwick mckibbin, professor of economics at the australian national university in canberra. \n \"it's just a mathematical thing,\" mckibbin said in a phone interview. \"most of the gdp loss that we saw in the sars model, and in reality, was china slowing down. and so, with china much bigger, you'd expect the billions would be much bigger.\" \n while difficult to pinpoint a precise cost as the crisis is still unfolding, the impact will be experienced mostly through changes in \"human psychology,\" he said. \"panic is what seems to be the biggest drain on the economy, rather than deaths.\" \n markets have been whipsawed by panic, paris-based amundi asset management said in a jan 29 note. chief investment officer pascal blanque and his deputy vincent mortier said the novel coronavirus provided the trigger for a pause in a stock market rally that began in october. \n mckibbin's forecasts are in line with those of other analysts. \n nomura international expects the blow to china's growth could exceed that seen during the sars outbreak. real gdp growth in the first quarter could \"materially drop\" from the 6 per cent pace in the fourth quarter, maybe by even more than the 2 percentage point deceleration seen in the second quarter of 2003 from the first, nomura economists led by lu ting wrote in a report to clients. \n bloomberg economists chang shu, jamie rush and tom orlik, said: \"back in 2003, china accounted for just 4 per cent of global gdp. fast forward to 2020, and its share has increased to 17 per cent. that means the global spillover if china's growth slumps will be larger. \n \"hong kong stands out as the most exposed - our simulation shows a hit of 1.7 percentage points (ppt) in the first quarter. south korea and vietnam would also suffer, each slowing by 0.4 ppt. japan would take a 0.2 ppt hit.\" \n more contagious than sars but less deadly, the insidious nature of the coronavirus, dubbed 2019-ncov, is such that it often presents as mild cold-like symptoms and can go undetected, which could potentially protract out the crisis for longer than the 2003 epidemic. \n the new virus, which emerged in central china in late 2019, is reported to have infected almost 10,000 people in two months, eclipsing the 8,096 sars cases reported from november 2002 through 2003, when the contagion spread from china across south-east asia and to north america and europe. \n \"if a country had a bad epidemiological outcome, then their shocks were likely be a lot bigger than countries that were able to control it well,\" mckibbin said, referring to his findings from examining the impact of sars.

hold on to their workers, but the coronavirus pandemic is expected to lead to an increase in layoffs as companies battle supply chain disruptions and sagging demand for some goods and services.    some businesses are already cutting jobs and demand is weakening, at least at the factory level. other reports on thursday showed companies announced more than 600 layoffs through march 12 tied to the outbreak, while producer prices fell by the most in five years in february as prices for energy products and services such as hotel accommodation, shipping and air travel dropped.    financial markets are expecting the federal reserve will aggressively cut interest rates again at its policy meeting next week to counter the coronavirus, which investors fear is the catalyst that will derail the longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year.    \"it's just a matter of time before the fallout from the coronavirus starts to show up in increased layoff activity,\" said nancy vanden houten, lead u.s. economist at oxford economics in new york.    initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 211,000 for the week ended march 7, the labor department said. jobless claims are the most timely labor market indicator. they have declined for two straight weeks.    economists polled by reuters had forecast claims rising to 218,000 in the latest week.    the four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 1,250 to 214,000 last week.    unadjusted claims for washington state, hardest hit by the virus, which causes a respiratory disease called covid-19, rose modestly last week.    the world health organization on wednesday termed the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. the \nvirus with flu-like symptoms has killed at least 38 people in the united states and sickened more than 1,300. overall, more than 4,700 people have died from covid-19 and over 127,000 have been infected.    the fed last week slashed its benchmark overnight interest rate by a half percentage point to a target range of 1.00% to 1.25%, in its first emergency rate cut since the financial crisis. financial markets have fully priced in a rate reduction of as much as 75 basis points at the u.s. central bank's march 17-18 policy meeting.    economists are predicting the fed will reduce its benchmark overnight interest rate to zero by year-end, given low inflation expectations, underscored by a plunge in treasury yields.    the dollar jumped against a basket of currencies after the european central bank announced more stimulus to fight the coronavirus but did not lower rates. stocks on wall street continued to drop, with the dow jones industrials index on course for its worst day since 1987 as investors took a dim view of president donald trump's decision to suspend travel from europe. u.s. treasury prices rose.       weak producer prices    the disease originated in china, the main source of inputs used in factories, as well as goods consumed in the united states. while some chinese factories have resumed operations after beijing extended the lunar new year holidays in an effort to curb the spread of the virus, they are running below capacity. the coronavirus is hurting demand for transportation, especially air travel, as well as entertainment and recreation, and leisure and hospitality services.    companies in the energy sector have also been affected as crude prices have tumbled, a decline that has been exacerbated by an oil price war between saudi arabia and russia. the united states is now a net exporter of oil and weak crude prices are likely to hurt capital expenditure and employment in the sector.    a separate report on thursday from global placement firm \nchallenger, gray and christmas showed as of the morning of march 12, employers had laid off 633 workers. most of the job cuts were in the entertainment and leisure industry. transportation, technology and energy sectors were not spared.    the trend could persist, with a third report from the labor department showing the producer price index for final demand dropped 0.6% last month, the biggest decline since january 2015, after surging 0.5% in january. in the 12 months through february, the ppi increased 1.3% after gaining 2.1% in january.    economists had forecast the ppi dipping 0.1% in february and rising 1.8% on a year-on-year basis. while the coronavirus-driven bottlenecks in the supply chain could boost prices for inputs, that is likely to be offset by weak oil prices and falling demand for services.    in february, wholesale gasoline prices plummeted 6.5% after declining 1.5% in january. gasoline accounted for nearly one-third of the 0.9% drop in the cost of goods last month. the decline in goods was the most since september 2015 and followed a 0.1% gain in january. wholesale food prices fell 1.6%.    the cost of services dropped 0.3% in february after rebounding 0.7% in january.    there were decreases in the cost of airline tickets, water transportation of freight and hotel accommodation, which recorded its biggest decline since april 2009.    but the cost of healthcare services rose 0.2% last month after rising 0.6% in january. portfolio management fees increased 0.3% after accelerating 2.3% in january. they could, however, take a hit from an ongoing sharp sell-off on wall street. those healthcare and portfolio management costs feed into the fed's preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures (pce) price index.    \"there are early signs in ppi that the coronavirus will weigh on various consumer prices significantly in coming months,\" said veronica clark, an

hour.   its restaurant manager, ms chao jun, said that the place would typically be three-quarters full during lunchtime, but it was not even a quarter-full when today was there. \nshorter opening hours, staff asked to take no-pay leave\u00a0   with sales dropping by 80 per cent, ms chao said staff had been asked to clear leave as there was no longer the need to have the usual manpower strength of five servers on a weekday.\u00a0   \u201cnow i only plan for two people to work. even two people also got nothing to do\u2026 only standing there waiting for customers,\u201d she said.   even restaurants which open only for dinner are facing the same problem. last saturday, mr marjun de claro, manager at the house of peranakan at outram park, said that the restaurant did not have a single customer for the whole night.\u00a0   the \u201czero sales\u201d phenomenon is also happening at retail outlets. ms zhuang said that there were several days where the store did not manage one single transaction. there was one particular day where it made a total of s$15 in sales.\u00a0\u00a0   when today visited apparel store ns\u2019 boutique at\u00a0square 2 at 2pm on wednesday, its director ms chrislyn ng said the store had not managed a single sale since it opened at 10.30am.\u00a0\u00a0   with business down by 30 per cent, mr freddy ng, operations manager of wang tian kitchen at outram park, said that his restaurant is now closed on saturdays. operating hours on weekdays have also shortened by about two hours.\u00a0   across the island, several business owners said they have started similar cost-cutting measures, such as reducing the number of part-time staff, or shortening the working hours of their full-time staff, inevitably affecting the income of these workers.\u00a0   several workers also voiced fears about losing their jobs if their companies continue to be battered over the next few months.\u00a0   ms candy chen, 47, a sales staff at just mobile, a mobile phone accessory store at nex mall in serangoon, said her commission had fallen by 30 per cent along with the drop in sales.\u00a0   all three employees of mr joe chen, a director of two apparel stores at novena square, have been asked to take turns to go on no-pay leave. as a result, they \nend up\u00a0working only three to four days a week.\u00a0\u00a0   he has applied for them to go for skills upgrading courses on the days that they are not working.\u00a0    like other malls across the island, businesses at novena square\u00a0have\u00a0been\u00a0affected. photo: raj nadarajan/today\u00a0   consumers staying at home\u00a0   with companies activating remote-working arrangements, and more individuals choosing to stay home because of the covid-19 outbreak, it is not surprising that malls are seeing lower footfall, thus affecting the businesses of retailers and f&b outlets.\u00a0   for ms michelle chin, 49, it is not just the malls she is avoiding. she has also stopped going to her church in bukit batok.\u00a0\u00a0   \u201cwhen (the virus crisis) first broke out, i said i didn\u2019t want to go church. my kids say, \u2018ma, don\u2019t be paranoid\u2019. but it\u2019s my personal choice\u2026 it\u2019s just a precaution,\u201d said the retiree, who had stopped attending church service for the past three sundays.\u00a0   some churches and other religious institutions have cancelled or scaled back their regular religious services and holding them online instead, after two covid-19 clusters were identified at churches.   before the outbreak, ms chin used to head to novena square at least once a day to buy her groceries, and patronised some of the shops in the mall now and then.\u00a0   that has all but stopped with the exception of a weekly grocery run.\u00a0   even then, it is a real quick run. \u201cthe minute i get into the mall, i get to the escalator, buy whatever i need and run back,\u201d said ms chin.\u00a0   while work-from-home arrangements naturally mean that f&b establishments in office areas would see a smaller lunch-time crowd, it does not automatically translate to increased sales at outlets in residential estates.\u00a0   to reduce the risk of exposure to the virus, ms doreen yeow started working from home whenever possible even before her workplace made it official.\u00a0   her lunch now consists of home-cooked food, as the 38-year-old engineer has stopped going to crowded places, \nsuch as malls.\u00a0   \u201ci don\u2019t step out of the house at all,\u201d she said. she only left home twice in the past week, once to visit her parents and another time to attend a class.\u00a0   mr sean wei leong, a 32-year-old risk manager, who also started working from home last week, said he generally avoids crowded areas, such as orchard road, although he does head to the suburban malls in tampines where he lives.\u00a0   some landlords extend a helping hand\u00a0   amid mounting calls for help from the retail and f&b sectors due to the covid-19 outbreak, deputy prime minister heng swee keat on tuesday unveiled two special packages totalling s$5.6 billion to help firms and workers, as well as households during his budget speech.   the packages dwarf the s$230 million package introduced during the sars crisis in 2003, and significantly exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations of at least a s$500 million package.\u00a0   part of the s$5.6 billion package is a s$4 billion stabilisation and support package (ssp) meant for businesses and workers affected by the covid-19 outbreak.\u00a0   the ssp includes:\u00a0   \u00a0a s$1.3 billion jobs support scheme where the government will pay for 8 per cent of the wages of local employees, up to a monthly cap of s$3,600, for three months.   \u00a0flexible rental payments for tenants and lessees under the jtc corporation, housing and development board (hdb), singapore land authority, singapore tourism board and sentosa development corporation.   a waiver of one full-month of rent for tenants at national environment agency-managed hawker centres and markets.   a half-month rent waiver for tenants under government agencies, such as hdb.\u00a0   a 15 per cent property tax rebate for changi airport and commercial properties.   \u201ci strongly urge landlords to pass this on to their tenants by reducing rentals,\u201d mr heng had said.   several property developers, such as capitaland, guocoland, asiamalls and frasers property, have said that they will pass on the full savings of the tax rebates to their \ntenants, in response to today\u2019s queries.\u00a0   marketing campaigns and free parking for visitors, among other initiatives, have also been introduced by some developers to help their struggling tenants. \u00a0   at suntec city, for example, tenants facing liquidity issues can tap a recently set up s$5 million fund which provides \u201cshort term, low-cost borrowing and quick access to funds for working capital\u201d, said mr anthony yip, deputy chairman of apm property management, suntec city's property manager.   businesses say they need more help\u00a0\u00a0   on the budget measures, several businesses told today that they would have preferred more direct help on rental rebates \u2014 such as how jewel changi is offering a 50 per cent rebate on rent for its f&b tenants for the months of february and march \u2014 instead of leaving it to the landlords\u2019 discretion whether to pass on savings from tax rebates to them.\u00a0   \u201csavings from the tax rebates are nothing to me\u2026 we are talking about occupancy costs (being) as high as 70 to 80 per cent (out of tenants\u2019 total costs) now,\u201d said mr r dhinakaran, president of the singapore retailers association (sra).\u00a0\u00a0   if developers do not provide a direct rebate on rent, a potential consequence would be the closures of several retailers, causing the malls to be empty, he noted.\u00a0   \u201cwhat can (the developers) do? they can\u2019t sue everybody who can\u2019t pay rent\u2026 (retailers) will just pull down the shutters and go away\u2026 that\u2019s a situation, i hope, will not happen,\u201d mr dhinakaran said.   instead, a \u201cfair approach\u201d during these challenging times would be to pay the landlord a certain percentage of the tenants\u2019 sales as rent, he suggested.\u00a0    some establishments\u00a0at jewel changi airport have\u00a0seen a 70 per cent fall in business amid\u00a0the covid-19 crisis.\u200b photo: raj nadarajan/today   mr vincent tan, president of the restaurant association of singapore (ras), echoed mr dhinakaran\u2019s sentiments, adding that passing on savings from a tax rebate is \u201cway below\u201d what the association is \nasking for.\u00a0   \u201cin fact, the 15 per cent rebate (announced during budget) comes from the government. the developers (are not going to) sacrifice a single cent,\u201d mr tan said.\u00a0\u00a0   last week, ras told the media that it had sent letters to 24 landlords, requesting that they offer rental rebates of up to 50 per cent for february, march and april.\u00a0   awfully chocolate\u2019s ms lee said there was \u201clittle\u201d offered in the budget that would help retailers directly and materially. recalling how property tax rebates were also part of the sars relief package back in 2003, she said that landlords then were reluctant to pass on the savings to their tenants.   \u201cit felt as if a great amount of cajoling had to be done before help was given\u2026 is the same thing going to happen? i can only assume so\u2026 so if the government\u2019s intention is that these tax rebates are passed down to the tenants, then i think they should be given with a set of parameters and directives. not left to goodwill and best endeavours,\u201d she added.   passing on the savings of a tax rebate may also not be as timely as compared to a direct rebate, said wang tian kitchen's mr ng.\u00a0\u00a0   \u201cif for now, i keep paying the same rent, so at the end of the year, the landlord say, \u2018i rebate you 15 per cent\u2019. what\u2019s the point? it won\u2019t help already. the thing is already over by then,\u201d he said.   some businesses said they were disappointed that unlike the 2003 sars relief package,\u00a0 the foreign worker levies were not reduced this time.\u00a0   while ms chris lim, a business partner at children edutainment provider diggersite, said she knows that the government\u2019s intention is to encourage companies to hire more locals, her hands, unfortunately, are tied.\u00a0\u00a0   \u201cour situation is different. the jobs we have, the locals will not take... (the government) thinks we should hire locals, but it\u2019s actually not our call,\u201d said ms lim, whose business includes a cafe at suntec city.\u00a0   as her company provides edutainment at company events and conducts field \ntrips for children, she has had to temporarily suspend these weekday services, as the government has discouraged large-scale public gatherings with the raising of the disease outbreak response system condition (dorscon) risk assessment level from yellow to orange.\u00a0   as for mr wai, who is renting a space from hdb for his mobile phone accessories shop in simei, he lamented that the half-month waiver for rental is \u201cvery little\u201d and not of much help.\u00a0   however, he said he was looking forward to the possibility of setting up flexible arrangements to pay rent, such as through an instalment plan.\u00a0   a struggle to hang on\u00a0   with no end in sight to the covid-19 outbreak yet, and consumers continuing to shun the malls and eateries, businesses are worried about the prospect of closures should the situation drag on longer than expected.\u00a0   mr heng has repeatedly assured businesses and households that the government is watching the situation closely, and it will not hesitate to do more if needed.\u00a0   mr chen, the apparel store director, said that he has an emergency fund that would be able to tide him through this crisis for the next six months, at most.\u00a0   \u201cif worst comes to worst, if after six months and we\u2019re still making losses, then we may have to close one of our stores. instead of two, we would just run one,\u201d he added.\u00a0   other businesses gave a shorter time frame.\u00a0   for example, diggersite\u2019s ms lim said she may have to take more drastic measures, such as retrenching full-time staff, if things do not improve in three months.\u00a0   mr shah iskandar, owner of south asian eatery az zumar at outram park, said he would assess the situation in a month\u2019s time. \u00a0   \u201cif the problem goes beyond end of march, finances will be very tight for us,\u201d he said. he might have to cut short his eatery\u2019s operating hours, which is currently open for 24 hours daily to just 12.\u00a0   that would also mean cutting the number of staff required to sustain the operations, he added.\u00a0   mr dhinakaran said \nmost retailers would probably be able to hold the fort for only the next two to three months, if things do not get better or if the landlords do not provide substantial rebates in rent.\u00a0\u00a0   \u201csuppliers will also chase for money. you have stock in the shop but not sold, doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t chase\u2026 you have to pay this, pay that, but no sales, how do you pay? then everybody will put up their hands and say, \u2018sorry cannot pay\u2019. that\u2019s what will happen,\u201d he said.\u00a0   ras\u2019 mr tan said most f&b outlets would be able to sustain business under current conditions for the next three to six months.\u00a0   professor lawrence loh, from the national university of singapore business school, called on major developers \u2014 the ones with the \u201cdeep pockets\u201d\u2014 to \u201cdemonstrate their social responsibility\u201d and help retailers and f&b outlets struggling to cope with the crisis.\u00a0   he pointed out that the economy this time would not undergo a v-shaped recovery, unlike what happened after singapore eradicated sars in july 2003.\u00a0\u00a0   \u201cit would be more like a flat u-shaped recovery\u2026 for this covid-19 outbreak, it\u2019s expected to be longer. it will simmer on, in dribs and drabs... there will be a persistent effect on retail. and even after the outbreak is officially declared to be over, business will not just recover overnight,\u201d he said.\u00a0   in the meantime, for service staff like ms zhuang and mr xu, they would need to tighten their belts and watch their spending \u2014 setting off a spiral of reduced consumption which would further hit retailers and eateries.\u00a0   \u201cright now, having a job is not bad already,\u201d said mr xu.   correction: an earlier version of the article stated that\u00a0ns\u2019 boutique\u00a0was located at novena square. this is incorrect. it is located at square 2. we are sorry for the error.

(here) here is what we know about the disease it causes and how it spreads:\n* like other coronaviruses, the new virus - which causes a disease now called covid-19 - is transmitted from person to person via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes. it can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles or railings.\n* scientists in china who studied swabs from infected patients say the new coronavirus behaves quite like flu viruses, suggesting it may spread more easily than previously thought.\n* covid-19 infection has an incubation period of between one and 14 days, and a study in the journal of the american medical association has found new evidence that the virus can be spread asymptomatically.\n* a world health organization-led team of investigating scientists in china has said that the epidemic there peaked between jan. 23 and feb. 2 and has been declining steadily since then.\n* they also found that the case-fatality rate is between 2% and 4% in wuhan and 0.7% outside wuhan.\n* infectious disease and virus specialists estimate that each infected person in the epidemic is infecting, on average, two to three other people.\n* the who said on monday that the covid-19 outbreak was not out of control globally and does not have a large-scale death toll, so it was \u201ctoo early\u201d to speak of a pandemic.\n* coronavirus infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, coughing, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. mild cases can cause cold-like symptoms, while severe cases can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory illness, kidney failure and death.\n* coronaviruses are a family of viruses that get their name from what they look like under a microscope - they are spherical and their surfaces are covered with \u201ccrown\u201d-like spikes.\n* animal viruses can mutate or combine with other viruses to create new strains capable of being passed to people. scientists say the new coronavirus originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via an intermediary animal species.\n* genetic data suggests the new coronavirus is the result of viral recombination - a process where more than one virus infects the same cell at the same time and creates a \u201crecombinant\u201d virus strain.

But it's not about him now. 2020 everything would be different, Hong Kong Chief Executive matthew cheung had promised even in December. kelvin laughs bitterly. He has long been no more trust in the policy. once a week as he had gone to demonstrate last says kelvin. and of course there was also repeatedly brutal scenes, still go before the police violent. but the real protest do not play more on the road from, \nbut on economic level. In recent months, something has developed that the demonstrators call \"Yellow Economy\", Yellow Economy. In a constantly growing type of online registration stores, restaurants, even gyms are called either yellow or blue. Yellow means: democracy. Blue: Beijing friendly. \"I'm Rigoros,\" says Kelvin, \"I do not give a penny at those who face the protests cold-blooded.\" It works quite well, he says, the blue shops got first problems. It is the collateral damage of a revolution that even simple employees can be made - their contracts canceled. That's done, it says. Important financial and trading place in detail can not be verified. But it seems to be clear that the economy Hong Kong - after all, has suffered a major financial and trading place for China - among the protests. Government Carrie Lam warns constantly against bad numbers. But if this should be scared of the demonstrators, it does not work. If economic pressure on the Beijing government does not affect what then? Kelvin says, \"How you expand your money is like a vote in a choice.\" At the same time it is a low-threshold shape of the protest. Everyone can join without being in danger. Consumption has long since become political. It suits this protest movement that the deepest dynamic strategy developed from the deepening of its creative mass. \"Be water, my friend\" - half a year this quote from Bruce Lee was the motto of demonstrating in Hong Kong. At the beginning of June 2019, hundreds of thousands went to the street for the first time to protest against a change of law which would allow to deliver suspects and offenders uncomplicated to China. Kelvin was there - even as Hong Kong police officers for the first time massively vengeance against protesters, on the 12th \nJune. It was an early turning point, after which the initially peaceful protest changed radically. Both sides were equal to: the police with even more tear gases, rubber chips, waterers and clubs; The mostly young demonstrators with Molotovcocktails and professional equipment. Roads became battlefields, weekly. Hard judgments Kelvin works during the week in a law firm. As a wizard, he takes care of cases of young demonstrators, which are to be convicted of weapons possessions. For hours he looks at recordings of surveillance cameras to be able to say exactly what when in a deal with the police. He says he was glad to do this work, even if it does not always happen. Because some judges accelerated procedures to condemn people quickly; Because many in case of doubt are always decided on the harder verdict. \"Last week,\" he says, \"If a 23-year-old was sentenced to twelve months in prison, because they helped a demonstrator to wear Molotovcocktails.\" The news agency Reuters recently wrote from around 7,000 people who were arrested during the seven months of protests . According to Policeichef Chris Tang, 1092 were convicted. Most of the goods arrested from 9 June to November 14, 2019, according to Reuters between 21 and 25 years old, most of them is male. Half a year of protests not only have the city twisted twisted in advocates and opponents of Beijing, but also families. The conflict is also one between generations, the youth thinks yellow, the grandparents blue. Fear of persecution So it is for example at the 23-year-old Dawn. She also does not call her real name for fear of persecution. For months, she has avoided the confrontation with relatives who hold the Loyalty to the Chinese State. Like her over-80-year-old grandfather. Only kinship from the mainland \nmanaged to talk about his travel plans for the New Year. Until then he believed that the communist party has the outbreak of the coronavirus under control. She also visited her family at New Year. Because the kinship ordered the food with a blue restaurant, she also released at a yellow. The EKLAT remained out - because exceptionally all talked about the coronavirus and not about politics.

on a regular basis when he or she travels frequently for work, and the latest coronavirus epidemic is not helping matters presently.   mental health issues are predicted to be one of the top 10 risks that business travellers will face this year. this is based on the latest travel risks outlook 2020 report by global travel risk management company international sos.   yet, these issues remain an overlooked aspect of business travel, especially in today\u2019s hypermobile work climate.   dr low kiang wei, medical director of international sos, said that not only does business travel take a toll on physical health, it also affects individuals on a psychological level due to factors such as time spent apart from loved ones, blurred lines between work and after-work hours, and anxiety due to unexpected increases in workload.   navigating travel risks such as natural disasters or epidemics can add on to the stress.   infectious diseases outbreaks are also one of the risks highlighted in international sos\u2019 report.   so far, health officials in china have confirmed more than 31,000 cases of the new coronavirus, with more than 4,800 of them considered severe. the disease, which causes pneumonia in its severe form, has claimed the lives of more than 630 people in china.   the virus, also known as 2019-ncov, has also sickened more than 200 people in at least 20 countries. in singapore, two patients who are warded are under intensive care.   dr low said of the anxiety that travellers face: \u201cwithout appropriate pre-trip awareness, risk mitigation advice, access to 24/7 assistance in case of emergencies such as natural disasters or epidemics, business travellers can also feel unnecessarily stressed about their own safety.\u201d   even with the appropriate preparations, an evolving and escalating situation such as the \ncurrent coronavirus epidemic can considerably increase a traveller\u2019s stress, he added.   \u201cthere is an element of the unknown and situations can change quickly.   \u201cin these circumstances, it is important to provide access to timely, accurate, verified information. travellers and assignees can also feel increasingly isolated and vulnerable,\u201d dr low said.   dr edwin ong, resident doctor at dtap clinic in siglap, said that stress and anxiety levels can rise when faced with the increased possibility of close contact and exposure to infected travellers, especially when heading to countries that have confirmed the presence of the virus.   \u201cbusiness travellers may feel that they are putting their health and well-being at risk by having to travel during this unsafe period, and this could weigh down tremendously on their overall mental health,\u201d he said.   what business clients are asking   ms wynne wee, vice-president of asia pacific at workplace options, which provides employee wellbeing solutions, said that her team has received \u201ca significant number\u201d of requests from companies, partners and individuals in the asia-pacific region seeking support during this period.   however, she added it is too soon to ascertain if the increase in calls is specifically due to the coronavirus outbreak.   ms wee said that clients in the management level who ask for support are concerned about how they can support their teams sensitively in these times while maintaining healthy business outcomes.   ms wee, who is a trained counselling psychologist, said: \u201cas with everyone else, the same fears (about the new coronavirus) holds true for business travellers, but we can imagine how this fear may be elevated for those who are still required to continue with essential business travel.   \u201con the other hand, if they\u2019re told that travel is put off, this will also have an impact on how one feels about their job security which leads to different concerns.\u201d   what one business traveller is doing   for \none frequent flier from singapore, ms syahidah y, she has greater freedom as the founder of makeup brand molly cosmetics to adjust her business travel plans.   with no obvious end in sight to the outbreak, she has made a self-imposed \u201csemi travel ban\u201d and will limit her business travels to just kuala lumpur in malaysia and myanmar.   otherwise, she also usually flies to china, hong kong, japan and taiwan\u00a0for work at least twice a month.   her hectic business travel schedules often leave her feeling weary and fatigued.\u00a0   \u201cwork travel is not as glamorous as people make it out to be,\u201d she said.   \u201csure, there are the comforts of travelling in business (class) or staying in fancy hotels, but in reality, the need to be in \u2018work mode\u2019 once you get off the plane, constantly be on your toes and be expected to perform your best for work activities \u2014 these affect you mentally.\u201d   it can also get lonely, she added. \u201cthere\u2019s limited time in a day. after dealing with work during your travel, you don\u2019t have much time to \u2018enjoy\u2019.\u201d\u00a0   how work travel messes with the mind   dr ong of dtap clinic said that the mind and body are interdependent, and neither aspect of health should be ignored.   \u201coften times, a much stronger emphasis is placed on physical health instead, such as sleep interruptions from jet lag, unhealthy eating and drinking and lack of exercise.   \u201chowever, if left undiagnosed and untreated, mental health issues can fester and worsen in severity, which in turn lead to the very same physical health issues that we are trying to avoid.\u201d   for instance, long distance or frequent travel affects the body\u2019s natural circadian rhythm, which is responsible for regulating sleep patterns.   poor or little sleep\u00a0in turn\u00a0causes increased levels of the stress hormone cortisol, which can lead to the development or\u00a0worsening of mental illness such as depression or anxiety, dr ong said.   in a separate 2018 study, commissioned by the international sos foundation, stress, depression, \nemotional exhaustion and heightened anxiety were reported in a large proportion of international business travellers.   almost half, or 45 per cent, of the respondents, reported an increase in stress levels. about a quarter reported heightened depression (27 per cent) and heightened anxiety (23 per cent).   about 31 per cent experienced emotional exhaustion \u2014 a core feature of burnout \u2014 on a weekly basis, while 41 per cent reported that their mood suffers during business trips, dr low said.   dr ong warned that unaddressed mental health issues as a result of work travel can create a ripple effect on other aspects of the person\u2019s life, such as work performance, relationships and social life.   there are consequences on a larger scale, too.   how it affects business costs   \u201cmedical claims for mental and physical health issues lead to increased costs for employers. reduced work performance, absence from work and short-term disability can result in decreased revenue,\u201d dr ong said.   yet, dr low pointed out that only 15 per cent of organisations surveyed in market research company\u00a0ipsos mori\u2019s business resilience trends 2020 include mental health issues in their travel policies.   he said: \u201cthis figure is worrying, given that there are increasing studies and accounts of business travellers suffering from mental health issues.   \u201cbusiness travel is likely to continue in the coming year, and it is important for businesses to build a holistic and preventive culture of health to protect the wellbeing of their workforce.\u201d\u00a0   what companies can do   dr low said that efforts to address mental health in the workplace need to begin at the c-suite, or management level, and trickle down to the frontline employee.   international sos, for example, has in place a range of employee mental health initiatives. it includes the use of an assistance mobile application for employees to receive updates on destination risks as well as briefings on their travel destination, if required from \nthe medical and security teams.   this has been especially useful in the current coronavirus outbreak situation.   \u201ctravellers are able to \u2018check in\u2019 (via the app) to let their employer know where they are, and to allow monitoring of travel patterns. it also allows tailored advice based on their travel to be proactively pushed out,\u201d dr low said.   \u201cfor example, a traveller can be alerted to review or change their routing based on alerts or messages being pushed out.   \u201cmanagers can also review daily travel patterns to proactively push out information to their staff. as this (2019-ncov) crisis has evolved, so has our health information \u2014 it\u2019s key that travellers have access to the very latest guidance to help allay their concerns.\u201d    having updated and useful\u00a0information at hand can help take away some of the anxiety that travellers have.\u00a0photo: media raw stock   from this month onwards, international sos employees in singapore will also be able to dial in to a helpline for professional counselling or talk about their emotional concerns. this phone service, done in partnership with workplace options, is now in operation in its china and europe offices.   workplace options recommends that all companies assess their employee\u2019s fitness and suitability for business travel before giving out work travel assignments.   ms wee said: \u201cnot everyone is cut out for business travel, which can take a huge toll on (a person\u2019s mental health). having the right fitness, mindset and resilience is important to ensure wellbeing and effective outcomes of business travel.\u201d   dr low said other practices that organisations can put in place to protect their employees\u2019 mental health include:   1. having mental health monitoring aside from physical health checks before and after travels   ensure that any post-trip feedback surveys include not just logistics, but feedback on mental health and psychological experience.   2. build an organisational restitution culture   encourage business \ntravellers to build rest and recovery into their schedule while on the trip and after returning. enable flexible work schedules for recovery; this may include working from home or taking prolonged weekends.   3. consider adding employee assistance programmes   this may include 24/7 access to at least telephonic emotional support, and wellness programmes.   4. make the trips as seamless as possible   for instance, if they encounter a health or medical issue while overseas and late at night,

scale both in its spread and declaration by the world health organisation (who). now, for the first time, the rest of the world has more coronavirus cases than china, the source region. the total number of covid-19 patients in the world has crossed 1.67 lakh with china accounting for less than 82,000, according to who's latest report. while the world reported 13,903 cases in preceding 24 hours. only 29 of these were reported from china. the who has already declared europe as the new epicentre of coronavirus pandemic. incidentally, it was only after the theatre of pandemic shifted from oriental landscape to europe that the more dominant powers appeared serious in tackling the contagion. here is an account of how the world has dealt with coronavirus pandemic. insulation the united states has suspended all flights from europe. president donald trump is expected to declare national emergency. many european countries such as germany, france and britain have followed a similar strategy to insulate themselves. this method has worked for many less developed countries such as magnolia, which is surrounded by china from three sides, north korea, located like cheese between the slices of south korea and china, two of the worst affected countries in the world. india too imposed massive travel restrictions. india began screening of passengers coming to india in the final week of february. the vigil was up not only at airports but also at the sea ports. the government said more than 27,000 people were not allowed to land in india at sea ports as the paths of the ships had crossed coronavirus affected countries. in nut shell, country-quantine is the most preferred method adopted by various governments to check spread of covid-19. covid-19 is a pandemic both in its scale of spread and by the declaration \nof the who. however, it is peculiar that there has not been attempts by leading countries to devise a common and coordinated strategy to fight the contagion. china called for international cooperation in early february. the who too called for a concerted global effort. but all countries ultimately devised their own specific strategy to deal with coronavirus spread. when the donald trump administration suspended flight operations from europe, the decision was criticised for having been unilateral in nature. italy, iran and other worse affected countries felt constrained in dealing with the crisis leading to sudden spike in the cases of covid-19. india, however, showed some initiative recently with prime minister narendra modi hosting a video-conference with the leaders of the saarc. decision was taken to create a saarc fund to fight coronavirus spread. such attempts taken in the initial days might have kept the novel coronavirus in check to a large extent. another tactic reportedly adopted by some countries was of underreporting and covering up the coronavirus outbreak. it began with china. for first two months -- now the first victims of novel coronavirus have been traced back to november 2019 against previously set starting point of mid-december 2019 -- china refused to acknowledge the covid-19 outbreak. the doctor who first went public with the reporting of coronavirus outbreak was severely reprimanded by the chinese government. the first health workers alerting the officials and asking people to beware of this contagion were also reportedly warned for \"rumour mongering\". later, that doctor died. chinese media said he died of covid-19. this all happened despite chinese president xi jinping telling the public that anyone found hiding the truth would be severely dealt with. recently, an old aide of xi jinping went missing after he criticised the chinese government for its handling of coronavirus pandemic. a pattern of cover-up was also seen in italy and iran, the \ntwo worst affected countries outside the source zone in china-hong kong-south korea. italian authorities are said to have dismissed the reports of coronavirus in initial days. they responded only after the situation spiralled out of control. the health infrastructure was found to be inadequate in the country. same has been the case with iran, which has already been reeling under the impact of multiple sanctions. in india, congress leader rahul gandhi alleged that the modi government was in stupor as coronavirus caused havoc in the country. this was an allegation of cover up. though, the government has been coming out with daily updates on the matter. the government has said that it is on the top of coronavirus situation in the country. coronavirus pandemic has challenged the human capital of the world. in equal measure if not more is the pressure that the governments are feeling over their economic capital. the full scale economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic is still unknowns but economic boosters are already being announced. the us federal reserve has cut down the interest rate to zero, and announced a mega $700 billion quantitative easing programme as the economy reels under the coronavirus pressure. the uk has slashed interest rates on loans for small and medium businesses. germany has announced tax cuts. australia has announced to pump billions of dollars in its market to avoid coronavirus-induced slowdown. italy announced a $28 billion dollar package to strengthen its health infrastructure. the european commission followed the similar suit. iran, for the first time in nealy six decades asked for money from the international monetary fund (imf). in india, the reserve bank of india has decided to infuse rs 1 lakh crore in the market to fight off adverse impact of coronavirus pandemic on indian businesses. the rbi has not altered the regular banking duties but asked the customers to do more digital transactions to avoid contact with bank employees and keep \nless pressure on the banking staff.

The alert inevitably altered his agenda and that of millions of Chinese who were preparing to enjoy his most precious holidays. The outbreak of pneumonia is still at the early stage and is understandable concern for its evolution. In the new year of the rat, will the new coronavirus become a species of mousetrap for the Communist Party of China (CCP)?\nThe CCP has taken the reins of the crisis. First, it was the Central Commission for Political and Legal Affairs by calling the officials of the Party and the Government against the temptation to disguise the severity of the situation. After the SARS crisis of 2003, it has been understood that opacity constitutes a major error that does nothing but aggravate the problem. The timely, precise and transparent information seems to have instituted as a rule in this case. Later, the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau issued the control slogan of the new Coronavirus as the maximum priority on any other matter.\nto the public health challenge that supposes to face a crisis of these proportions in a country, in spite of everything, in the process of development, with a number of deaths that approaches the hundred and thousands of affected, the CCP is equally added a challenge political. The preservation of social stability remains a priority. The criticism was followed by the slowness for the slowness of the initial reaction. The authorities have been extended and relentless in the adoption of energetic and unprecedented measures and this has placed them. At least, for now.\nWithout option to hesitates, the CCP stresses the muscles to demonstrate its invincibility. Far from being amylaved, the slogan aims to go around the crisis, making it a palpable demonstration of its aptitude to face the most serious challenges, whatever they are. A message aimed at both Chinese society and the rest of the world, even in scientific order, with capacity and competence exhibition to find quick answers, at another time perhaps impossible. China can not yet be compared with the West in many parameters, but I would like to be able to have a crisis of these proportions suggest Xi Jinping crisis. That conviction inspires the proceeding of the CCP in these difficult hours, an invocation to that nationalism that closes rows but that can not be overlooked that this is the second time it happens. There can not be a third.\nThis is a year of great importance for the CCP. EN 2021 will celebrate the first centenary of its foundation. I wanted to present a country in a country in the world. Its maximum aspiration is to proclaim the four winds that has managed to make China a prosperous and accommodated society, a respected country in the world.

The Epidemic of Coronavirus of Wuhan threatens, increasingly, to become a new element of friction - one more- in the complicated relations between the United States and China. Beijing has made it clear its discomfort over the way Washington has reacted to the greatest catastrophe that the Asian country lives in years. Measures such as the suspension of flights or veto travelers from China only serve, according to the government of President Xi Jinping, to \"create and propagate fear\". It is the second occasion, in just three days, in which Beijing has ceased its irritation so it considers an exaggerated reaction of the first power. This Monday, at a press conference offered through the Internet - as part of the measures to avoid agglomerations and prevent contagion-, the spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Hua Chunying, accused Washington that, in addition to giving the pistolleta of Departure to a worldwide race to close air borders and traffic, \"has not yet offered any substantial aid to the Chinese side.\" The epidemic still is still under control in China. The deceased already add up 425, more than the 348 that left SARS in this country in 2003. Infected are already more than 19,000, of which at least 2,296 are in a serious state, according to the figures disclosed on Tuesday at first time. And it will have lasting consequences. This Monday, the National Reform and Development Commission, the almighty organism in charge of economic planning in China, recognized that it will leave a serious negative effect on the country's economy, especially in the consumption sector.

The cases of contagion outside Hubei, the focus province of the epidemic, also decreased for two days, a possible indication that the drastic measures that the central government has imposed against the propagation of the virus begin to take effect. Those \"green outbreaks\" feed Beijing's anger towards how United States has answered, with too much precipitation from his point of view. The commercial and technological war, paused after the signing of a first phase agreement in December, convinced the XI Government that a new \"Cold War\" has begun, in which Washington's ultimate goal is to prevent the rise of China . Beijing now interprets the behavior of EE. UU In this epidemic as another attempt more to try to weaken it. The White House responds that its behavior is due to public health reasons. \"In a globalized world, the destinations of all countries are closely linked. Faced with a public health crisis, countries should collaborate to overcome the difficulties instead of resorting to impoverishing the neighbor, much less to take advantage of the difficulties of others, \"Hua laughed. The weekend, the spokeswoman had already held in a statement that the acts of Washington \"are not a gesture of goodwill\". ee UU, which has confirmed nine contagion in its soil, was the first country that announced that it would repatriate its nationals trapped in Wuhan, the origin of the epidemic, after that city of eleven million inhabitants imposed on 23 a sudden quarantine that blocked All your accesses.

lockdown on more than 56 million people in the central hubei province, the epicentre of the deadly coronavirus outbreak, on wednesday amid warnings by experts of a looming second wave of the covid-19 infections in the country due to the steady rise in \"imported cases\". the prolonged lockdown of hubei's capital wuhan will end on april 8, lifting the mass quarantine over the city with a population of over 11 million. wuhan, the central chinese city where the virus cases were first detected in december last year on monday reported one new confirmed case of the covid-19 after reporting zero cases for five consecutive days. hubei province and wuhan city which together have over 56 million population were kept under strict lockdown since january 23 with a ban on all movement of people and transportation. china is embarking on a major step to open up its coronavirus epicentres just as india and the world is seriously grappling with the fast-paced spread of the disease which has become a global pandemic forcing most of the countries to go into a lockdown mode. people in wuhan will be allowed to leave the city and hubei province, if they hold a green health code, meaning no contact with any infected or suspected covid-19 cases, according to a circular issued by the provincial covid-19 control headquarters, state-run xinhua news agency reported. wuhan will take differentiated measures to promote the resumption of business operations based on the health risks of different regions to mitigate the impact on the economy, the circular said. other areas in hubei will lift outbound transportation restrictions from wednesday. migrant workers who hold green cards and get negative nucleic acid testing results will be sent out of the province to their workplace directly. on january 23, wuhan declared unprecedented traffic restrictions, including suspending the \ncity's public transport and all outbound flights and trains, in an attempt to contain the epidemic within its territory. similar restrictions were soon introduced in other areas in hubei. local officials announced plans to gradually ease the severe measures as the virus cases dropped dramatically in recent days. hubei, however saw seven new deaths on monday, all of which were in wuhan, bringing the total number of deaths in the province to 3,160. the province still has 4,200 patients being treated in hospitals of which 1,203 were still in severe condition and another 336 in critical condition, according to china's national health commission. hubei has so far reported a total of 67,801 confirmed covid-19 cases, including 50,006 in wuhan reflecting on the intensity with which the vicious virus, reportedly emerged from a local live animal market in the city shook the province. on tuesday, the nhc reported 78 new confirmed cases, including 74 imported infections taking their total to 427. the overall confirmed cases on the chinese mainland has reached 81,171 by the end of monday. this included 3,277 people who died of the disease, 4,735 patients who were still being treated and 73,159 patients discharged after recovery, the nhc said on tuesday. while the gradual opening of hubei province will enable its over 56 million to emerge out of the strict lockdown which also effectively shielded the grim stories of their suffering, there are apprehensions highlighted in the chinese official media about how they will be received in the rest of the country considering the stigmatisation of the areas with covid-19 and its deadly nature of transmission. as the virus emerged in wuhan, several foreign countries, including india, has evacuated their nationals and subjected them to stringent quarantine procedures to ensure the virus is not spread back home. also as china appeared eager to reopen the country starting factories and business to make up for the lost time, chinese experts \nwarned of a possible second wave of the covid-19 virus attack. the total number of imported cases of the virus reached 427 on tuesday as a large number of overseas chinese especially in countries like italy which have now emerged as the new covid-19 epicentres arrived back home. loopholes in screening processes at customs and inadequate quarantine measures upon entry into the chinese cities as well as a high proportion of asymptomatic cases are making the second wave of novel coronavirus outbreak highly likely, even inevitable, as the global pandemic continues to worsen, state-run global times reported on tuesday. although a drop in new cases is reported on a daily basis, all new cases now are imported infections, sparking serious concerns over a looming second outbreak in china, it said. china's epidemiologist li lanjuan told media here on monday that china still faces a severe situation currently due to the surge in imported cases from other countries and regions. \"china is already facing the risk of a second outbreak as the number of imported cases already reached a small peak,\" zeng guang, chief epidemiologist of the chinese centre for disease control and prevention (cdc), told the global times. however, various chinese medical experts believed that a second outbreak is unlikely, considering the country's stringent measures and experiences during the past two months in combating the disease.

"exclusive: u.s. axed cdc expert job in china months before virus outbreak. washington (reuters) - several months before the coronavirus pandemic began, the trump administration eliminated a key american public health position in beijing intended to help detect disease outbreaks in china, reuters has learned. the american disease expert, a medical epidemiologist embedded in china\u2019s disease control agency, left her post in july, according to four sources with knowledge of the issue. the first cases of the new coronavirus may have emerged as early as november, and as cases exploded, the trump administration in february chastised china for censoring information about the outbreak and keeping u.s. experts from entering the country to help. \u201cit was heartbreaking to watch,\u201d said bao-ping zhu, a chinese american who served in that role, which was funded by the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention, between 2007 and 2011. \u201cif someone had been there, public health officials and governments across the world could have moved much faster.\u201d zhu and the other sources said the american expert, dr. linda quick, was a trainer of chinese field epidemiologists who were deployed to the epicenter of outbreaks to help track, investigate and contain diseases. as an american cdc employee, they said, quick was in an ideal position to be the eyes and ears on the ground for the united states and other countries on the coronavirus outbreak, and might have alerted them to the growing threat weeks earlier. no other foreign disease experts were embedded to lead the program after quick left in july, according to the sources. zhu said an embedded expert can often get word of outbreaks early, after forming close relationships with chinese counterparts. zhu and the other sources said quick could have provided real-time information to u.s. and other officials around the world during the first weeks of the outbreak, when they said the chinese government tamped down on the release of \ninformation and provided erroneous assessments. quick left amid a bitter u.s. trade dispute with china when she learned her federally funded post, officially known as resident adviser to the u.s. field epidemiology training program in china, would be discontinued as of september, the sources said. the u.s. cdc said it first learned of a \u201ccluster of 27 cases of pneumonia\u201d of unexplained origin in wuhan, china, on dec. 31. since then, the outbreak of the disease known as covid-19 has spread rapidly worldwide, killing more than 13,600 people, infecting more than 317,000. the epidemic has overwhelmed healthcare systems in some countries, including italy, and threatens to do so in the united states and elsewhere. during a press briefing on sunday shortly after this story was first published, president donald trump dismissed the reuters report as similar to other stories regarding the cdc that he described as \u201c100 percent wrong,\u201d without addressing whether the role had been eliminated. u.s. cdc director dr. robert redfield maintained the agency\u2019s presence in china \u201cis actually being augmented as we speak,\u201d without elaborating. in a statement to reuters before the report was published, the cdc said the elimination of the adviser position did not hinder washington\u2019s ability to get information and \u201chad absolutely nothing to do with cdc not learning of cases in china earlier.\u201d the agency said its decision not to have a resident adviser \u201cstarted well before last summer and was due to china\u2019s excellent technical capability and maturity of the program.\u201d the cdc said it has assigned two of its chinese employees as \u201cmentors\u201d to help with the training program. the agency did not respond to questions about the mentors\u2019 specific role or expertise. the cdc would not make quick, who still works for the agency, available for comment. asked for comment on chinese transparency and responsiveness to the outbreak, china\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs referred reuters to remarks by spokesman \ngeng shuang on friday. geng said the country \u201chas adopted the strictest, most comprehensive, and most thorough prevention and control measures in an open, transparent, and responsible manner, and informed the (world health organization) and relevant countries and regions of the latest situation in a timely manner.\u201d one disease expert told reuters he was skeptical that the u.s. resident adviser would have been able to get earlier or better information to the trump administration, given the chinese government\u2019s suppression of information. \u201cin the end, based on circumstances in china, it probably wouldn\u2019t have made a big difference,\u201d scott mcnabb, who was a cdc epidemiologist for 20 years and is now a research professor at emory university. \u201cthe problem was how the chinese handled it. what should have changed was the chinese should have acknowledged it earlier and didn\u2019t.\u201d alex azar, secretary of health and human services (hhs) said on friday that his agency learned of the coronavirus in early january, based on redfield\u2019s conversations with \u201cchinese colleagues.\u201d redfield learned that \u201cthis looks to be a novel coronavirus\u201d from dr. gao fu, the head of the china cdc, according to an hhs administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \u201cdr. redfield always talked to dr. gao,\u201d the official said. hhs and cdc did not make azar or redfield available for comment. zhu and other sources said u.s. leaders should not have been relying on the china cdc director for alerts and updates. in general, they said, officials in china downplayed the severity of the outbreak in the early weeks and did not acknowledge evidence of person-to-person transmission until jan. 20. after the epidemic exploded and china had imposed strict quarantines, trump administration officials complained that the chinese had censored information about the outbreak and that the united states had been unable to get american disease experts into the country to help contain the spread. azar told cnn on \nfeb. 14 that he and cdc director redfield officially offered to send a cdc team into china on jan. 6 but still had not received permission for them to enter the country. hhs oversees the cdc. \u201cdr. redfield and i made the offer on january 6th - 36 days ago, 60,000 cases and 1,300 deaths ago,\u201d azar said. \u201cwe made the offer to send the cdc experts in to assist their chinese colleagues to get to the bottom of key scientific questions like, how transmissible is this disease? what is the severity? what is the incubation period and can there be asymptomatic transmission?\u201d days later, the world health organization secured permission to send a team that included two u.s. experts. the team visited between feb. 16th and 24th. by then, china had reported more than 75,000 cases. on feb. 25, the first day the cdc told the american public to prepare for an outbreak at home, u.s. secretary of state mike pompeo accused china of mishandling the epidemic through its \u201ccensorship\u201d of medical professionals and media. relations between the two countries have deteriorated since then, as trump has labeled the coronavirus the \u201cchinese virus\u201d - a description the chinese have condemned as stigmatizing. last week, the chinese government announced that americans from three u.s. news organizations, the new york times, washington post and wall street journal, would be expelled from china. the decision to eliminate quick\u2019s job came as the cdc has scaled back the number of u.s. staffers in china over the last two years, the sources told reuters. \u201cwe had already withdrawn many technical public health experts,\u201d the same expert said. the cdc, however, disputed that staffing was a problem or that its information had been limited by the move. \u201cit was not the staffing shortage that limited our ability\u201d it said. the u.s. cdc team in beijing now includes three american citizens in permanent roles, an additional american who is temporary and around 10 chinese nationals, the agency said. of the americans, one \nis an influenza expert with expertise in respiratory disease. covid-19 is not influenza, though it can cause severe respiratory illness. the cdc team, aside from quick, was housed at u.s. embassy facilities. no american cdc staffer besides quick was embedded with china\u2019s disease control agency, the sources said. china in recent weeks has reported a dramatic slowdown in new cases, the result of drastic containment measures including the lockdown of hubei province, home to 60 million people. nevertheless, the infectious disease experts who spoke with reuters said, the united states could use people like quick with contacts on the ground, especially if fears of a second wave of infections materializes. thomas r. frieden, a former director of the cdc, said that if the u.s. resident adviser had still been in china, \u201cit is possible that we would know more today about how this coronavirus is spreading and what works best to stop it.\u201d dr. george conway, a medical epidemiologist who knows quick and had served as resident advisor between 2012 and 2015, said funding for the position had been tenuous for years because of a perennial debate among u.s health officials over whether china should be paying for funding its own training program. yet since the training program was launched in 2001, the sources familiar with it say, it has not only strengthened the ranks of chinese epidemiologists in the field, but also fostered collegial relationships between public health officials in the two countries. \u201cwe go there as credentialed diplomats and return home as close colleagues and often as friends,\u201d conway said. in 2007, dr. robert fontaine, a cdc epidemiologist  and one of the longest serving u.s. officials in the adviser\u2019s position, received china\u2019s highest honor for outstanding contributions to public health due to his contribution as a foreigner in helping to detect and investigate clusters of pneumonia of unknown cause. but since last year, frieden and others said, growing \ntensions between the trump administration and china\u2019s leadership have apparently damaged the collaboration. \u201cthe message from the administration was, \u2018don\u2019t work with china, they\u2019re our rival,\u2019\u201d frieden said. trump\u2019s re-election campaign sent out a statement sunday evening dismissing controversy about the cdc\u2019s cut as a matter of politics. \u201cdemocrats are eager to politicize the coronavirus crisis and weaponize it against president trump, the statement said. \u201cin so doing, they\u2019re siding with the chinese and providing cover for beijing\u2019s cover-up.\u201d "}, {"content": "china's wuhan, where the coronavirus emerged, begins to lift its lockdown. wuhan, china (reuters) - the chinese city of wuhan, where the coronavirus outbreak first
