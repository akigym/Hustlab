"}, {"content": "Virus and uncertainty in Latin America. There is a new virus in the world, and the question we all ask ourselves is the same: when will it come near our? The NECOP (Acronym for \"New Coronavirus\") was born to thousands of kilometers from Latin America, in a remote region: no city of the continent is counted among those who receive more visits from the Chinese provinces affected according to a detailed study. And yet, searches on Google about \"coronavirus\" have been shot in recent days. In all cases, the alarm comes for a suspicious case. Media and audience are (we are) to the hunt of the Latin American zero patient from the NECOp. We have already had several discards: one on the Border Tamaulipas, another in Cali, another one in northern Argentina, several in Brazil under study right now. Most likely, this case arrives, sooner or later. Everything progresses so fast that it is possible that when you read these lines, we have it among the newspaper holders. But what will you mean that exactly? What will it mean for the region that has imported a breathing virus still little known? Our brain perceives the risks better if it defines them dramatically. We need a character (the disease) and a drastic change during the events (the daily routine) to start warning. But the disease rarely behaves according to this Hollywood script, no matter how much we insist on placing it within the story. Take, for example, the influenza A (Porcina) epidemic born in Mexico in April 2009. From one week for another, the country's attention (and from the whole world) turned on four characters: H1N1. An emergency sensation was quickly infected, as moved by electrical impulses, reflecting, for example, in the corresponding Google searches. But the evolution of the epidemic was substantially more gradual. What is more: Little by little, scientific teams were distilling the actual impact \nAdded by the virus, imposing the necessary containment and response measures in parallel. In the end, it was a contagious disease, yes, and surprisingly dangerous for the younger ones (when the flu usually affects especially those over 65). but did not suppose the catastrophe in mortality that our minds wanted to dramatize: According to an estimate of the US Disease Control Center, H1N1 ended with the lives of approximately the same people than seasonal flu, remaining below other pandemics in last. Our brain, however, remains determined to look for dramas so be in seemingly cold numbers. One of these figures, which has captured the attention of the audience in social networks over the NECO, is the one known as R0: the average of people who will be infected from another already infected by a disease. We barely had a few weeks of epidemic when several epidemiologists took out their estimates. Some climbed the highest figures for, once again, to sound the alarm with style messages \"each affected by Coronavirus will infect three people.\" But the truth is that these estimates were considerably variable. They are always: even with well-known diseases, the value of the R0 changes enormously according to the study. It is just normal: after all, a disease can behave very differently according to the social context in which it is developed. A viral outbreak will not be the same in a place without hygienic conditions and high-density population, which in a little inhabited area. That is why even the most contagious, such as measles, offer greatly wide ranges of contagion. Also, let's not forget that the stockings can be deceptive: if it turns out that the contagion value of the NECOV in China is 2, this figure is as compatible with the idea of \u200b\u200ba thousand infected by transmitting the virus to two people each, as the extreme scenario of ten \"super- \nContagiators \"that affect fifty people more each (because their work puts them in contact with many people, because there was still no insulation, or for other reasons) and other nine hundred and ninety that contagiate less than a person per capita. While the first scenario would guarantee an exponential contagion, in the second control of the virus it would be much simpler once one identifies the conditions that favor mass transmission. Between the ends there is a whole world of possibilities that we do not know, and that will condition when and how the NECOV will come to Latin America. Actually, what these numbers teach us is that uncertainty is an unavoidable aspect when we talk about epidemics. The drama is, in fact, a way to reduce it: if we have a clearly identifiable enemy, fear becomes certainty. But this same bias is the one that makes us despise us or ignore those risks to which we have already become accustomed. Even when they suffer a worrying rebound. Let's talk, for example, of the aforementioned measles. In 2016 there were less than one hundred cases in the American continent. Two years later, the figure had multiplied by one hundred and sixty: about 16,000, accounted for by WHO, most located in Brazil. In 2019 Sao Paulo recorded the first death for this disease in two decades. The lack of complete and effective vaccination coverage was the main cause. Malaria, contagious through mosquitoes in certain tropical areas, is another case of return of an adversary that never went complete. But here the peso of the rebound corresponds to Venezuela, which coashed more than half of the total cases in 2017. Interestingly, although both diseases have disproportionately called attention in the respective countries during the last half of 2019, both in Brazil and in venezuela look (measured by Google searches) turned quickly to Coronavirus in early 2020, confirming that nothing surpasses a good, new \nHistory of fear and uncertainty. Thus, although our attention will follow different logic, while certain diseases are very diminished or almost disappeared in the region (cholera is a good example of success), others are maintained with similar figures (tuberculosis: around 280,000 cases in everything The American continent year after year throughout the 21st century) or, as those previously referenced, even recover lost terrain. When looking for causes, there are no simple answers. Mosquito-transmitted diseases offer a good example. Several Venezuelan doctors on the ground have complained about the absence of fumigations headed by the state they served to decimate malaria. but the fumigation is not everything: as was wondering in his editorial March 2016 the magazine of the National Institute of Health of Colombia, of Zika (another virus infected by bites) in Colombia and Brazil, does it really how cash is to fumigate in Places that do not meet the health conditions (aqueduct, garbage collection) minimum? The director of the Institute of Health and Environment of the University of the Forest, V\u00edctor Olano, aimed at a subsequent copy of the same publication the need to guarantee these minimum coverages in rural areas as a first line of fire against another disease still present in the continent : Yellow fever. A similar reflection We can do in your day with the NECOV: although it is likely that all media attention will focus on the design of new drugs, the basic proliferation control measures (early identification of cases with its corresponding isolation) and the maintenance of Healthy immunological systems are the most effective, but less spectacular strategies. Likewise, the best way to prevent this type of epidemics flourish is the implementation of hygienic protocols in the treatment of animals by humans, something in which public powers \nThey also have a lot to say and do. The war against epidemics is not, in short, a matter of a single dramatic battle for the fate of humanity. Nor will it be with the NECO, as it was not with H1N1 (which, although diminished, continues between us). The moral is that, as the Swedish Disclacer Hans Rosling said, we must tame our thirst for drama and re-refocus attention, efforts, dedication towards that which can really have a positive impact. In the case of infectious diseases, vaccines, protocols and health infrastructures, research and the existence of international response mechanisms are our best allies. While the first two points are those that will help us combat the already known diseases, research and supra-state capabilities are particularly crucial when we are facing a new disease. Aware of this, the World Health Organization agreed on an international regulatory framework in 2005 to ensure commitment to common standards in the region, and throughout the world. year after year, WHO itself measures the degree of implementation of regulations in each country. Although there are obvious differences in the region, the concordance is considerable. There are some worrying points with regard to preparation, and certain countries are strikingly behind the rest. In addition, it is important to emphasize that these WHO figures do not measure quality or the effective state of land health systems. Something in which, for example, Venezuela would rule well below the rest given the deterioration suffered by its facilities with the crisis of recent years.

Just circulate vehicles or walk people through the streets. More than 46 million people are blocked by quarantine. Many transport, suspended. Classes in teaching centers, canceled to new order. The shops, closed. The Coronavirus of Wuhan, who has already killed 170 people and infected with more than 7,800, threatens to leave, at least in the short term, profound effects on the country's economy, which already faced its lower growth in decades, 6.1 %. According to the economist Zhang Ming, of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences - the main Chinese state Think Tank -, in statements that collects the magazine Caijing, GDP growth in the first quarter of this year could be reduced at a percentage point and Situated at 5% or even less, due to the parion because of the virus. These days, Chinese cities look like huge deserts. Cinemas, museums, and tourist attractions have canceled their operations. Most stores continue to closed; Those who have opened -with the dependents well covered by a mask - barely register activity, except those that sell groceries. Many restaurants have not bothered to reopen despite the fact that, under normal conditions, these would be days of making a box: now the public avoids the crowded places. In the industrial nucleus of Suzhou, factories are prohibited from reopening until February 8. In Shanghai, companies will not resume their activity at least until 9. Along with consumption, the sector most affected by containment measures has been transport. To the blockade of a good part of Hubei, the province where Wuhan is located - the focus of the infection - adds the recommendation to avoid displacements as much as possible. The airports, where it should be his time with greater activity of the year, are half-life. they have \nparalyzed bus routes long-distance and high-speed train. travel abroad with tour operators have been suspended. according to official government data, transport has fallen over the Lunar New Year dates from 2019 by 28.8%. in the railway sector, the decline reached 41.5%. in air, 41.6%. the situation could not come at a worse time. Chinese New Year is like Christmas or black friday in the West, the moment of greatest consumer spending, a sector of increasing weight in the Chinese GDP. weak demand and the shocks caused by trade war between the US and China had left the economic growth at 6.1%, its lowest level in three decades you. \"The impact of the coronavirus in the Chinese economy may be much more important than that was the sars\" says Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief Asia economist of investment bank Natixis. Garcia-Herrero refers to the syndrome, also caused by a coronavirus in the same family as Wuhan, emerged in 2003 in a market in Guangzhou (South China) to leave nearly 800 deaths worldwide. then, that epidemic played down one percentage point to China's growth during the second quarter of the year, which stood at 9.1%. sales to the retail fell by half. although the blow to the economy was only temporary, and growth in subsequent quarters regained their previous levels above 10%. but now, says Garcia-Herrero, \"China depends much more on consumption which depended in 2003, and consumption will slow without any doubt.\" to luxury goods and durable is necessary to add the hospitality industry. \"There are many sectors that will be affected, and they are much more important for Chinese growth than they were in 2003 when external demand was the key,\" she says. \"In China in 2019, consumption contributed about 3.5 percentage points to the total real growth of 6.1% \nof GDP. A quick calculation points to whether spending on those services falling by 10%, the total GDP growth would fall by about 1.2 percentage points, \"says the consultancy S & P Global Ratings on a note. The first indications are not encouraging. In its reopening after the holidays, the shares in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange have receded 2.4%. Due to the closure of the main chains and the suspension of the major premieres, in New Year, when box office records are usually broken, the collection in theaters was only 1.81 million yuan, or about 250,000 euros, according to the company Ticket sales Maousan. It is a fall of 99% with respect to the previous year. \"It is a certainty that the croconavirus outbreak will have an impact on this quarter's economic growth,\" says Mark Williams, capital Economics, on a note. Compared to SARS, \"while this time the most transparent and active official response can be demonstrated more effectively in virus containment, it can also make the initial economic damage.\" A good part of these damages could correspond to the broad sector of the Chinese submerged economy, the one represented by migrants to urban areas. Back in the field to pass the festivities with their relatives, many have been surprised by the quarantine or have seen their travel plans altered. The prolonged paron of his jobs can leave them without income while it lasts. \"After SARS, China adopted an expansive fiscal policy, including tax cuts, to help the recovery of the most affected sectors,\" says Tianlei Huang, from the International Institute of Economics Peterson (PIIE). \"This time, China has large fiscal deficits and, therefore, has less space to apply fiscal stimuli than then. In monetary policy, the central bank can increase liquidity support, but there will be no stimulus driven by credit. \" The key, point the \nAnalysts will be rapidly with which the crisis is resolved. \"Depending on how the crisis is reduced, and especially how the Chinese Government is managed - not for a short extent as transparent to be-, the cost could aggravate the reduction of Chinese growth,\" says Huang.

Specifically to France, where three cases have been confirmed, two in Paris and another in Bordeaux, the Ministry of Health has communicated this Friday. The ad coincides with the research that Spain is doing, which studies if a woman in the Basque Country that returned from China is recently infected by the Coronavirus, since she presents symptomatology linked to this disease. This Friday, the Spanish Ministry of Health discarded two other potential contagions and the United States detected the existence of a second affected by the disease, which has already caused 41 dead in China, according to the last figures updated by Bloomberg, and maintains in quarantine to 41 Millions of people in that country. By announcing at first time of the night the first two cases, the French Minister of Health, Agn\u00e8s Buzyn, warned that everything points out that these first European cases will not be the only ones. Shortly after, it's office confirmed the third case, related to one of the first two detected. \"It is likely that there are other\" people infected in European territory, overtaking Buzyn, for whom the virus \"is a fire that must be delimited.\" In all the French cases, these are people who have been in China and, at least one of them, is recorded that she was in the city of Wuhan. It is the patient admitted to Bordeaux, a 48-year-old Chinese citizen who came to a medical center on Thursday 23 to \"consult by the symptoms\" presented after his return one day before China, where \"he passed through the city of Wuhan\" For \"Professional Reasons,\" Buzyn explained at a press conference. The affected one is admitted from the eve in Bordeaux \"In an isolated room\" and \"it is well\", although before confirming the disease of it \"he was in contact with a dozen people from the return of him to France.\" The Sanitary Authorities go \nA \"Contact\" to these people, to verify their health status, asserted. Less is known about the two Parisian cases. From the first announced, Buzyn revealed that he is admitted to the Bichat hospital in the capital. \"We know that this person traveled to China, but we do not know if he was in Wuhan,\" the minister, professional doctor added. In a statement to the mid-night edge, the ministry of it indicated that another case was confirmed that was being investigated, and that is related to one of the first patients. The third affected, who have not given data beyond that he was also in China, is also admitted to Paris. \"All measures of isolation and hygiene have been taken,\" said the Ministry of Health. Buzyn has insisted that \"it is possible\" to locate new affected in France, although she has assured that everything possible is being done to \"contain\" the spread of the virus by the country. The minister has asked for returning travelers from China who, before the smallest sign of discomfort, do not go to hospital emergency services but by contacting the health authorities before, \"to avoid all potential contagion.\" Meanwhile, in Spain, the Public Health Directorate and Addictions of the Basque Government Health Department has been notified this afternoon from a suspect case associated with the Coronavirus of Chinese origin. It is a woman who has recently returned from Wuhan province in China and presents pathologies linked to this disease. The affected is entered into isolation at the University Hospital of Cruces, according to Europe Press. The Basque Department of Health has reported that the analytical sample has already been sent to the National Microbiology Center of Majadahonda, reference laboratory to carry out this specific analysis and is planned to have the result in the next 24-48 hours. In addition, two other cases that were studied in Spain as \nSuspicious by the coronavirus of Wuhan have given negative. This has not been reported by the Ministry of Health on Friday afternoon after the Director of the Health Coordination and Emergencies Center of the Ministry of Health, Fernando Sim\u00f3n, reported that same day that two people were being studied by possible contagion, since Both recently arrived in Spain from the Chinese city origin of infection with some symptoms. The Sanitary Authorities of the United States have confirmed this Friday a second case in the country of aggressive Coronavirus. Like the first case, detected during the last weekend in Seattle, it is a person who recently traveled to the city of Wuhan, epicenter of the health crisis. So far, the virus has caused 41 deaths, all in China, all but two in the Wuhan region. More than 1,100 have been contaminated in that country, of which almost two hundred are in a serious state. Authorities are also monitoring 1,072 suspected cases. So far, the virus has arrived in Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, Nepal, Taiwan, Macao, United States, France and Japan.

In 2003 he won the sars virus decrypts now developed the first proof test for the new coronavirus from wuhan. since then asks all the world to his advice. it should actually be impossible to christian Drosten get hold. but the director of the institute of virology at the Berlin Charit\u00e9 adheres radically to a strategy that he has already made during the sars epidemic to its credo: have all the information out, everything has to the public. just as a virus can keep in chess. So christian bustles Drosten - something he's late, he just was official in the Foreign - last Monday in his office, looks even more quickly through a few e-mails, participate in a round natural wooden table space, leans back and is focused. is the situation in the light of technological progress today compared not much better than epidemic sars while? \"I do not know,\" said Drosten. on the one hand we have with many genome analyzes very quickly find out that the virus still far from being circulated among humans. \"That's good to the epidemic to estimate.\" on the other hand have the mobility society drastically changed the Chinese. \"I can well imagine, the rapid spread of the present virus that alone explains it.\" The 47-year-old medic has been engaged in his entire professional life with corona virus. than the sars pathogen (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic began his end of 2002, initially no one knew what acting for a germ it. then working christian Drosten the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg and developed diagnostic tests for infectious diseases. succeeded in identifying young scientists, the pathogen of sars, a coronavirus, similar to the current 2019 Ncov in China. colleagues with it at that time could one in the shortest possible time \nPresent in favor. Two years later he received the Federal Cross of Merit. With only 35 years, the result alternated as head of the Institute of Virology at the University Hospital Bonn, ten years later he went to the Charit\u00e9. There, the virologist with his team has now been pursuing every week of the new coronavirus for weeks. Without having had it in the laboratory, he developed the test for it. Drost does not claim, he already understands the virus. Like all involved, he must deal with the fact that the data situation changes every hour. First, it was from China, the virus could not be transferred from person to person. That was overtaken soon. Then it was said that drastic measures such as the locking of entire metropolises could contain the virus in China. A miscaluation. The image of the coronavirus is sharp sharp than it requires the rapid media world. Therefore, exceeds this day formulates only one working hypothesis: the novel coronavirus is in principle like SARS. At this time, he derives from that 2019-NCOV only lets people with symptoms. One day later, in Bavaria, a Chinese of Shanghai has transferred the virus to employees of a company, allegedly she was asymptomatic. An alarm signal: In symptomless hosts, the virus can unrecognized far travel and infect many people on the way. In the renowned New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), a specialist article about the Bavarian case appears, the global health nightstand is proclaimed by the WHO. A week later, it is clear that the Chinesin had back pain and took a fever-cut drug, which is why the infection did not find out - and that the authors of the article had not spoken with the Chinesein. Christian Drost's name was also under the publication. That's uncomfortable for him. Normally, in a group of authors, you can check all the facts, he says, \"but in this case I just had to be the authors \nTrust, which have dealt significantly longerly with the case history of the patients \". As a confirmation laboratory, he has only included data, and for those he is right now. But is not this breakdown an example of that the premature publication of data is harmful? But exists? It remains with its demand for maximum transparency. That the patient still had lectures despite disease and have been able to infect colleagues, show that the virus is more likely to spread themselves than initially. But the breakdown with the article in the NEJM evidence shows another questionable development. \" The journals today actively put pressure on the speed and want sensation. \"And this also applies to the high-ranking publications. Drosten published the very first work on the novel coronavirus in Eurosurveillance, the scientific journal of the European Center for Prevention and Control of Diseases. \"We would have that in the NEJM PUBL I can, \"he says,\" but did not intentionally do that. \"It was more important that all the data is made fully available online so that everyone can read. The only thing in a situation with inadequate data is helping transparency, says exit. Because only if all information is immediately available for the competent institutions, erroneous assumptions could be corrected and initiate proper reactions. When he represented this rigorous demand during the SARS epidemic and published at an early stage, the \"totally unusual,\" he says. And today he annoys that some colleagues still did not understand it and held important current data. Drosting also fights behind the scenes for the fact that Science journales introduce new transparency rules. Manuscripts should be accepted only as part of a separation outbreak if the authors the data at the same time on a publicly available pre- \nPrint server deposited. \"This is the only regulation that can work to finally get transparency into this system or prevent the system from progressing in the fight against epidemics.\" The virologist himself also practices transparency in public. A colleague of him says that there is one of the few virologists who fully understand the epidemics - both the molecular biological site and the clinical aspects and the educational work. He learned from the SARS crisis, says that, in addition to the transparent dissemination of scientific data, the open communication with the population was essential. \"Alone the knowledge of the disease has already sufficient in Hong Kong to bring the patients to the doctor earlier.\" If the situation as current in Wuhan escalate, accordingly, \"every dramatic message expedient\". Because only then people would change their behavior: avoid human beings and maintain the necessary social distance. Spread his knowledge, now eats a large part of Christian Drost's time. What is not very harmless to him. \"I'm not sure if that as a scientist is so good for me,\" he says, \"you have to be careful not to become a television professor.\" At the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities of the World Health Organization WHO reported an accumulation of pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause in the Central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the diseases. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days then a group released a group of the virologen Christian's premier from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 the first diagnostic test for the new virus, the researcher provisionally call 2019-NCOV. With the test, the virus can be detected in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, \nOn which in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals like snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected. Both the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as well as Mers (MIDDLE East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses which have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more than 750 died. With the MERS virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronaviruses. Many of them relate to respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example. In China, several thousand persons are suffering from them, some of them - most of them with pre-existing conditions - have died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first infection cases outside of China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been in Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection with a tourist, who came back from Wuhan, on January 24, the first cases were known in France. Meanwhile, first cases were confirmed in Germany. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. The virus can cause pneumonia that can endally end. Since it is a viral illness, antibiotics do not help. Meanwhile, it is clear that the virus can be transferred from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transfers after a dozen cases were known in medical staff. Medizors assume that the virus is transmitted above all over droplet infection. The World Health Organization calculates, as announced on January 24, at the moment that an infected one section 1.4 to 2.5 others \nPeople infect. Contest these numbers, the virus is less contagious than SARS and also the viral flu. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals. That can not be said yet. The World Health Organization said on 28 January that about one-fifth of the reported cases through the virus will be seriously ill, so in case of doubt must be treated intensive care. According to reports, the first death pots were patients who had some severe pre-existing conditions. Even with other infectious diseases, people with pre-existing diseases are particularly endangered - for example at the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so change their genome. This can cause you to become more dangerous for people in the course of an outbreak - but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) expects no similar mortality to the current time as the outbreak of SARS. "}, {"content": "rpt-china stocks off 2020 lows as beijing calms nerves over virus outbreak.

A new virus has China on alert. It is a mysterious pneumonia, from which dozens of people have been infected in the city of Wuhan and that corresponds to a new strain of a coronavirus similar to that in 2002 caused the epidemic of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome, for its acronym in English). This has been confirmed by Chinese National Television, CCTV, according to the investigations of a group of scientists who has managed to isolate the genetic sequence of the infectious agent.\nMedical tests have confirmed the presence of this new pathogen in 15 of the 59 cases detected since the beginning of December, all of them in Wuhan, capital of the Hubei province. The origin of most of these infections has been located in a fish and seafood market, in which living animals were marketed. Since then, the area has remained closed and quarantined. To date, none of the patients has died and even eight patients, which no longer showed any symptoms, were discharged on Wednesday. Local health authorities have ensured that no transmission between human has been detected.\nThe Coronavirus, who receive their name by the crown form that adopt views of the Miscroscope, usually attack the respiratory tract of mammals. To date, only six were known. Four provoke mild symptoms similar to those of a cold. The other two, on the other hand, are sadly famous: in 2002, the SARS Coronavirus, originated in China, caused the death of more than 700 people around the world; While in 2015 the MERS (respiratory syndrome of the Middle East) left 449 dead.\nGiven the antecedents, the news has been received with concern in the country. \"I am very afraid. I remember that the SARS appeared next to the Spring Festival and then expanded thanks to the means of transport, \"wrote a user at Weibo, a social network similar to Twitter. The words of him refer to the Chinese New Year, which in 2020 will take place on January 25. On the occasion of this national festival, it is a tradition that people return to the family home, causing the greatest human migration of the world, with more than 3,000 million displacements: an ideal scenario for the spread of a virus.\nThe mysterious ailment, however, could have already jumped off the borders of the Asian giant. In South Korea, a woman of Chinese nationality has been put into isolation before the possibility that she is infected, the Korean Disease Control and Prevention Center (KCDC) reported on Wednesday. The 36-year-old woman was diagnosed on Tuesday with pneumonia, after two business trips in which she among other cities visited Wuhan. Neighboring countries, meanwhile, have begun to extreme security measures at airports.\nThe World Health Organization does not consider it necessary, at the moment, to establish special measures for travelers. This has been announced in a communiqu\u00e9 made public this morning, ensuring that \"new coronavirus appear periodically [...] and China has a solid health system, capable of responding and managing outbreaks of respiratory infections.\" The institution, which has shown its willingness to provide technical support to the health authorities of the country, has sentenced that \"in the coming weeks it will be necessary to need more comprehensive information to better understand the current status and epidemiology of the outbreak\".\nIn the same direction, scientists responsible for identifying the virus have been expressed, ensuring that their initial finding must be completed with more research. Although it is possible to obtain evidence of the presence of pathogens in a short period of time, the production of a vaccine can take years.

who can carry the virus without knowing it - to avoid their parents and grandparents. but this growing isolation of the elderly has spawned its own crisis, as families try to balance the need to care for loved ones with directives to stay away, shifting the burden to overstretched governments and medical facilities.    studies suggest the severity of coronavirus rises with age. in italy, which now has the world\u2019s highest death count, the average age of those dying is 80, according to a study by the italian national institute of health. in china, where the pandemic started, people 70 and older accounted for just 12 percent of all infections but more \nthan half of all deaths, according to the chinese center for disease control and prevention. in the united states, people 65 and older have thus far accounted for 31 percent of cases, 53 percent of intensive care hospitalizations and 80 percent of deaths, according to u.s. government data.    beyond the grim statistics, the pandemic has spawned countless small dramas of isolation and anxiety across the globe. in a village in lebanon, a grandmother walled herself off in her home, unable to properly grieve her dead husband. in spain, nursery home workers produced a facebook video so residents could reassure their loved ones. and in colombia -

sarcastic and self-deprecating. and sometimes just downright rude. there are wife jokes, husband jokes, boss barbs, modi jibes, weight gain worries and the inevitable china insults. humour in all forms is the panacea it seems for people around the world who are united in their need to laugh or at least crack a smile in these troubled times. as three billion people across the world stay indoors in a lockdown never before seen on this planet, some are sharpening their creativity and the rest are having fun with the jokes flooding in through memes, cartoons, videos, one-liners and others.and they are all going around the world in minutes, thanks to the ubiquitous social media, particularly whatsapp. no subject is out of bounds as people all over use wordplay, clever drawings and other witticisms to mirror a society, warts and all, going through its worst crisis in a century. one pocket cartoon shows a bride flinging a garland at the groom on the other side of the fire. given the threat of coronavirus, both are in masks and the priest is seated a distance away. another perhaps reflecting matrimony many years down the line has a woman, her brows knitted together as she wields a spoon over a wok, and her smiling husband slouched on the sofa watching 'lock-down special' on tv. \"no, he is not helping at all. he just claps for me for a full 5 minutes a day,\" she complains.

bajane ko bola tha, dhol manjira leke raste pe kirtan karne ko kisne bola (i had asked you to clap in your homes, who asked you to go out and celebrate while playing musical instruments),\" reads one meme. and there is this cartoon that makes fun of the new 'work-from-home' trend with panic-stricken passengers on a plane. \"this is your pilot speaking. i'm working from home today\", reads the text. the work/stay at home dogma takes a swipe at the couch potato too -- a split frame of a man fast asleep on the couch with a remote in his hand and the words '2019 lazy bast***', and the same pic below but this time with the label '2019 responsible adult'. many posts are quirky and slightly snide wordplays -- \"villagers in punjab are still wondering who the hell is soshail distan singh?\", for instance, or \"xi jinping's message to the world: no ming ling\". \"finally got the hindi name of social distancing 'tan doori\"', reads a whatsapp forward breaking up word for food cooked in a tandoor to 'tan' (body) and 'doori' (distance). with india under an unprecedented 21-day lockdown to curtail the spread of the disease, a meme makes a reference to india's richest man, reliance industries' mukesh ambani, and his palatial 27-storey residence antilla in south mumbai. \"lockdown ki wajah se aaj maine pehli baar apna pur ghar dekh liya (it is because of the lockdown that i got to see my whole house for the first time)\". a widely-shared meme on the lockdown features former jammu and kashmir chief minister omar abdullah, released from detention in srinagar earlier this week. it shows him with his hand on his forehead and a text saying, \"when you spend 236 days in lockdown, and on the day you get out, the govt imposes 21-day national lockdown.\" the meme later got approval by the national conference leader himself, who re-tweeted it and \nwrote: \"these are serious & scary times so a little humour doesn't hurt\". and then there is this one that says, \"my body has absorbed so much soap and disinfectant lately that when i pee it cleans the toilet.\" there are also several posts trolling china either for allegedly spreading the virus to other countries or its peculiar eating habits. \"ek toh pehle china ko jain banao (firstly, make chinese residents follow jainism),\" tweeted one karan sitlani, referring to the vegetarianism of the jain community. another whatsapp forward takes a jibe at the chinese products, \"coronavirus won't last long because it was made in china\". the novel coronavirus, which originated in the central hubei province of china in december, according to two recent studies published in the journal nature, may have originated from bats. videos are making their point too. one doing the rounds has a wife telling her husband to call the house help because she hasn't come for three days. the man calls her only to be told that she is working from home and will tell him what needs to be cleaned in his home -- overturning the class dynamic while stressing that coronavirus affects everyone. another has a father trying to put his crying child to sleep. all it takes is his sternly calling out to 'corona' and the child is quickly silenced. sometimes it is just savage and dark. like this one-liner, doing the social media rounds, which says, \"we can meet in may if all stay put at home or shall meet in heaven\". or this one, \"dear god, please reboot 2020. it has a virus\". and, of course, as in all kinds of humour, some jokes are sexist and racist too, using tired tropes. humour, sometimes good and sometimes tired, can be infectious too. and as the world waits for this crisis to end, people all over can say -- just bring the smiles on.

"}, {"content": "how will covid-19 and cooling measures such as absd impact property market?. last wednesday (feb 19), deputy prime minister heng swee keat told bloomberg tv in an interview that the government has no plans to ease property cooling measures.   \u201cit is not on our radar at this point because we need to make sure that we stabilise the economy and we address long term structural issues,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u00a0   this is understandable given that the covid-19 outbreak has led to a percentage point downgrade in the official forecast of singapore\u2019s economic growth this year.   at the same time, the outbreak will also have an adverse impact on the private residential market, with spillover effects on the entire real estate value chain and the longer-term stability of the property market.\u00a0   why is this so?   let\u2019s take a look at where the market stands today as well as cooling measures such as the additional buyer\u2019s stamp duty (absd).   currently, developers now must build and sell all their units in a project within five years to get a remission of the absd on the land purchase price.   otherwise they will have to pay the 25 per cent absd, with interest.   absd was 10 per cent when it was introduced in dec 2011, before it was\u00a0raised to 15 per cent in july 2013 and the current 25 per cent in july 2018.   in 2020, developers are going to launch some 10,402 units from 48 projects, based on cushman & wakefield research\u2019s estimate. of these, 4,765 units or 46 per cent will come from the luxury segment or the core central region (ccr) segment.   traditionally, about 28 per cent of the buyers of ccr homes are permanent residents and foreigners from china, which has been hard hit by the covid-19 outbreak.   singapore has since banned travellers who have visited mainland china recently, and the majority of that includes chinese passport holders who could be the potential buyers of these luxury units. in 2019, non-pr china buyers bought a total of 359 units, of which 141 units were in the ccr. \nat a broader level, demand for private residential units might slow to a trickle soon, judging from the market reactions in our neighbouring countries affected by covid-19.   as an indication of how far sales could fall, china home sales plunged by 90 per cent in the first week of february compared to the same period in 2019, according to preliminary data on 36 cities compiled by china merchants securities co.\u00a0   before the virus outbreak, the singapore market was already expecting a more challenging sales environment in the coming months due to resistance to high prices and launch fatigue especially for smaller developments. the mood is now more bearish due to the virus outbreak.   the temporary shortage of labour will also have an impact on the property market.   construction companies have expressed concerns about failing to meet deadlines due to workers from china not being able to return to singapore and quarantine orders placed on affected workers in the industry.   the authorities have urged developers not to penalise contractors and subcontractors for the unexpected delays.   beyond a temporary labour shortage, construction companies face a bigger and complex challenge arising from the global supply chain disruption caused by the lock-down in many china cities, with factories remaining shut or operating with reduced capacity.   in singapore, construction material and finished products are not expected to arrive in time for assembly or use. as manufacturers in china and the entire world are so interdependent, it is hard to predict how soon manufacturing would resume and at what capacity.   what has made the situation more dire for singapore construction firms is the mandatory adoption of the pre-fabricated pre-finished volumetric construction (ppvc) method at many government land sales sites.   modern construction technology such as ppvc requires all components to be assembled off-site before they are delivered to the project site under construction. these \ninclude door, glass panels, tiles, sanitary ware etc. it does not allow construction to proceed if there is just one missing item.   although the current supply chain disruption would likely impact all stages of construction, the impact on ppvc construction would be more pronounced.   the construction delay and the ripple effect beyond the short to medium term could have serious repercussions on the already fragile residential market.   in about two to three years\u2019 time, the singapore residential market could deal with a supply overhang arising from the enbloc boom between 2017 and 2018.   at the same time, all developers are bound by a five-year absd remission deadline that is fast approaching amid slower sales.   on the supply front, there are 49,173 uncompleted private residential units (excluding executive condominiums) with planning approval.   of this, 30,162 remain unsold. there are also an additional 4,575 private residential units that do not have planning approval yet.   based on the 9,912 units sold in 2019, it should take developers roughly about five years to clear the existing stock and narrowly escape the absd penalty, assuming sales momentum in 2019 can be maintained this year.   looking at how things are now, it is unlikely that developers will be able to sell their projects at the same pace as previously anticipated.\u00a0   in short, they could be hit with a double whammy \u2013 construction delays and potentially missing the absd deadline due to unforeseen circumstances which are no fault of theirs.   developers could slash prices drastically to try to move units but this could have a destabilising effect on the market as a whole.   it is still fairly early days and how long the outbreak will last and how exactly it will affect the broader economy and the property market is still unclear.\u00a0   but if the outbreak worsens, there is a case to be made for the authorities to extend the current absd deadline.   the point is not only to provide much needed relief \nfor developers, but to cushion the impact on the property sector.   as it is, the current absd rule is too blunt a tool, as it does not differentiate the larger projects of hundreds or even thousands of units, from the smaller ones.   as the economy is expected to head south, the larger projects have a much higher chance of missing the deadline, as they typically require a much longer time to sell out all the units especially during challenging times like now.   an extension of the absd deadline would help developers to stagger new home sales and manage risks better arising from supply overhang.   it would go a long way to help the market, long after the virus blows over, to avert a worst-case scenario that housing units are dumped in the open market in a disorderly manner, hurting both\u00a0consumers and the economy.

largest single-day drop in over 10 years. singapore \u2014 the singapore stock market on monday (march 9) suffered its largest single-day drop since october 2008, as markets around the globe were battered following\u00a0a plunge in oil prices that\u00a0fuelled rising alarm over the economic impact of covid-19.   after weeks of slow and gradual decline, the benchmark straits times index (sti)\u00a0nosedived 6 per cent \u2014\u00a0shedding 178.61 points to 2,782.37.   it was the worst fall since the height of the global financial crisis and dragged the main market index to its lowest levels since 2016.   the massive selloff across the globe was triggered by a plunge in\u00a0oil prices after the world\u2019s major oil producers failed to reach an agreement on cutting production, which sparked a price-cutting war in an environment where supply is exceeding waning demand.   among many global losers, japan\u2019s nikkei sank 5 per cent and australia\u2019s asx 200 dived 7.3 per cent.   market experts in singapore warned investors not to take their chances during such turbulent times, and to leave the analysis and guesswork to the professionals.   the sti, an index which tracks the performance of the top 30 companies listed on the singapore exchange, saw all three banks here \u2014 dbs, ocbc and uob \u2014 fall by at least 6 per cent. conglomerate keppel corp tanked by almost 10 per cent, genting singapore dropped 6 per cent and singapore airlines was down 4.5 per cent.   analysts warned investors against thinking that this might sound like a good time to enter the stock market and pick up some bargains among blue chips.   they said that\u00a0this is a time to be extra cautious because the confluence of factors that are causing the current market carnage is unprecedented, and there is no knowing how long the market bloodshed will last.   why did the market plunge?   the plunge in the sti, experts told today, was largely due to a meeting of two \u201cblack swans\u201d\u2014 an oil price war and an \nairline industry robbed of demand from the covid-19 outbreak. a black swan event is one that comes as a complete surprise and has\u00a0deep consequences.   on friday, russia refused to join the organisation of the petroleum exporting countries (opec) in a large production cut as the covid-19 outbreak continues to slow the global economy along with the demand for oil, the new york times reported.   in retaliation, saudi arabia decided to cut oil prices by nearly 10 per cent on saturday.   price wars such as\u00a0these have led to steep falls in oil prices before, as in 2016. however, experts said\u00a0that with the covid-19 outbreak looming in the background, there are no \u201cwinners\u201d in this situation.   mr song seng wun, an economist at cimb private banking, said that when there is a sharp fall in oil prices, there will normally be winners and losers, but in this instance, it is a \u201closer-loser\u201d situation.   \u201cnormally, the airline industry has been the primary beneficiary of such a sharp plunge in oil prices. now, no one wants to take (a plane).   \u201chad it just been the oil price war without the coronavirus outbreak fears, we would all be travelling to japan for s$1 priced tickets. but now, even with that pricing, we would be scared to go,\u201d he said.   ms pan jingyi, a market strategist at brokerage firm ig, said that besides the fall in oil prices, the increase in the number of infections outside of china has caused negative sentiment in the market.   this is due to the growth in covid-19 cases in countries such as iran, italy and south korea, where case numbers have spiked from the tens to the thousands in the span of weeks.   \u201cthe backdrop still being the coronavirus impact\u00a0that\u2019s causing quite a lot of turmoil in the market,\u201d she said. \u201cthe hit on demand is already the general situation in the market, and the market has processed that in.\u201d   what should investors do?   mr terence wong, chief executive officer of fund management\u00a0company azure capital, said that due to the \u201cmany \nunknowns out there\u201d, punters should not be investing \u201caggressively\u201d at the moment.   \u201cit could have other impacts on other parts of the economy that you may not think about,\u201d he said. \u201cif you asked me last week, i couldn\u2019t tell that this would happen\u2026 there will be a high degree of risk (to invest) right now.\u201d   agreeing, mr song said that investment during such dire circumstances should be left to the professionals.   \u201cwe have the virus outbreak plus a price war, i don\u2019t think laymen are equipped to deal with this kind of fluid landscape,\u201d he said.   though the experts generally warned against investing during this period of turmoil, there could be a sliver of opportunity for those willing to take the risk.   if one had to choose certain industries to invest in, it should be more stable\u00a0industries such as primarily consumer staples, which includes producers of food, household goods and other essentials, ms pan said.   mr song added that the healthcare sector, especially health care services and medical equipment manufacturers, are set to do well during this period.   a larger risk would be to invest in cyclical stocks, those that are tied to the business cycle, ms pan said. these include companies in the industrial sector or those that deal with energy production.   what to expect from the stock market   the rate at which the market will recover depends not just on the spread of the virus, but the fear among the population, the\u00a0analysts\u00a0said.   mr wong of azure capital believes that the market will recover when the number of cases stabilises. now that the number of cases is still \u201cjumping around\u201d, this will cause uncertainty in the market, he said.   \u201cif you look at china, the number of new cases has already been decreasing,\u201d he said. \u201cif, globally, we didn\u2019t see wild numbers\u2026 i think we could have already made a recovery in the market.\u201d   mr song agreed that consumer fears play a bigger role in curbing demand than the actual number of cases does.   \u201c(chances of a \nrebound) depends on how confident market participants are about the outbreak being contained, the most important being the fear factor,\u201d he said.   however, when a rebound will come is hard to tell, which makes it difficult to know when one should start investing again.   ms pan said: \u201cwith every market shock, there will be a recovery, but the problem this time is that we are dealing with something that is very uncertain (with the) coronavirus. perhaps we will need to see a vaccine come through, to be a remedy (to the economy).\u201d   in the meantime, players in the market can only hope that the worst will be over soon, but there is no indication of how big the

"}, {"content": "coronavirus: how it could have jumped from animals to humans and other questions answered. singapore - the ministry of health (moh) announced on wednesday (jan 22) that it is setting up a multi-ministry task force to tackle the mysterious wuhan virus that has already infected more than 400 people in china.   although it has yet to reach singapore's shores, increased air travel in the lead-up to the chinese new year holidays has led to the ministry - as well as other agencies across the world - stepping up precautionary measures to either prevent entry of the disease or contain its spread.   as of wednesday afternoon, the wuhan virus, a type of coronavirus which causes pneumonia in its victims, has claimed nine lives.   but what is the virus and how did the wuhan virus spread to people?   here are some questions and answers about the wuhan coronavirus behind the latest outbreak.   viruses are microscopic parasites that lack the ability to survive and reproduce outside living organisms, which includes animal, humans and even bacteria.   for this reason, it is debatable if they are truly \"alive\". they become active only when they come into contact with living cells, which they then try to hijack to produce more viruses.   even so, viruses are made of biological material and have the biggest population of any biological entity on earth, triggering responses in living things that range from unnoticeable reactions to death.   some experts believe that nearly 10 per cent of the current human genome is viral genetic material, as a result of viruses infecting human cells for millennia.   they belong to a large group of viruses that usually\u00a0infect only animals, and are so named for the crown-like spikes on their surface.   but from the mid-1960s, scientists began identifying coronaviruses that affect humans, with seven types of these viruses classified to date, according to the united states centres for disease control and prevention.   four of these typically cause mild to \nmoderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses like the common cold, with well-known symptoms such as sore throats, cough, and headaches.   but the remaining three have more recently caused severe repercussions on human health as scientists scrambled to understand them.   the first is the infectious\u00a0severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) coronavirus, which killed almost 800 people in 32 countries 17 years ago.   the other two are the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov), which was first reported in saudi arabia in 2012 and later spread further, and the latest wuhan virus (2019-ncov)\u00a0which killed its first victims in the chinese city of wuhan.   scientists have speculated that the virus from the latest wuhan outbreak, like the mers and sars viruses that preceded it, evolved from coronavirus strains that previously affected only animals.   this ability of a virus to \"jump\" from animals to humans is not unusual and has given rise to a category of illnesses called zoonotic diseases, which also counts among its ranks diseases caused by non-coronavirus viruses like the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) and ebola.   zoonotic viruses generally have a single strand of genetic material called rna, which is more easily copied or mutated than humans' double-stranded dna, which accounts for their virality.   to date, the wuhan coronavirus has been closely linked to huanan seafood market in wuhan, which reportedly also peddled live animals like deer and animal parts in addition to seafood.   scientists have said such \"unnatural situations\", where animals are brought together and often housed in bad conditions in close proximity to people, create opportunities for viruses to hop between animals. the virus could then have changed so that it is able to infect humans and eventually start spreading between people.   every virus typically infects a certain type of living host organism, said dr sebastian maurer-stroh, deputy executive director of research at the agency \nfor science, technology and research's (a*star) bioinformatics institute.   \"viruses can shift their host preference through mutations... some viruses mutate much faster,\" he added.   the wuhan coronavirus is understood to spread much like the common flu does - through the air when an infected person coughs, through close contact such as shaking hands with an infected person, or touching an object with the virus on it before touching one's mouth and eyes.   for now, virologists have said that the wuhan coronavirus - based on reported rates of infection - is likely not as infectious as the sars virus. but there are concerns that the wuhan virus' current reported 2 per cent death rate - two out of 100 infected people die - is not representative and that the virus could further mutate to become more lethal.   dr michael wong, a senior family physician at raffles medical, said the virulence of the wuhan virus cannot be underestimated. \u201cwith mutations, the virus could increase in virulence and transmissibility, leading to a serious pandemic,\u201d he said.   the chinese government has classified the wuhan virus outbreak in the same category as the sars epidemic, meaning compulsory isolation for those diagnosed with the illness and the potential to implement quarantine measures on travel, said dr wong.   there are also worries that the number of infections is yet under-reported, with many brushing off symptoms as those of the common flu.   it is a different strain and, for now, has reported a lower fatality rate than the sars virus.   the world health organisation estimates that the overall fatality rate for sars patients to be between 14 per cent and 15 per cent, while that for wuhan is currently at 2 per cent.   researchers have said that the wuhan virus shares only 76 per cent of its genetic material with the sars virus - a big difference in genetic terms much like \"comparing a dog and a cat\".   there is, however, speculation that both viruses originated from bats. recent \nreports have also suggested that the wuhan virus might be linked to snakes too.   no, said professor paul tambyah, from the department of medicine at nus yong loo lin school of medicine.   \u201ci don\u2019t think we should panic as panic is never a good approach.\u201d   instead, we should be concerned.   he said there are measures in place to control the outbreak here and elsewhere. the public should be concerned and thus be vigilant about maintaining good hand hygiene, seeking medical attention if unwell and staying home, he said.   wear a surgical mask when you have a cold or flu, to prevent the transmission of airborne germs.   some doctors have been wearing surgical masks as a precautionary measure at work, so some people may\u00a0wonder if they should dig out their n95 masks too.   but\u00a0there is no need to, said professor leo yee sin, the executive director of the national centre for infectious diseases. instead, they should wear surgical masks.\u00a0   \u201cn95 masks are of a very special design. they are very difficult to breathe in. if you find the n95 mask easy to breathe in and comfortable, you are wearing it wrong and it\u2019s no use,\u201d she said. \u201cit\u2019s only when it is difficult to breathe that you are wearing it correctly.\u201d   it is thus not recommended for the general public, she said.   in fact, if you use it wrongly, it may make things worse because you think you are protected when you are not, she said.   dr leong hoe nam, an infectious disease specialist at mount elizabeth novena hospital said that everyone with respiratory symptoms must wear masks, now that there\u2019s human to human transmission.   the moh on thursday said singaporeans should avoid travelling to wuhan, stepping up a notch from its advice on wednesday for people to\u00a0defer non-essential travel there.   the ministry said it updated the travel advisory \"in view of the\u00a0developing novel coronavirus\u00a0situation in wuhan and other parts of china\", with confirmed cases spreading beyond wuhan to beijing, shanghai, tianjin and \nguangdong, which abuts densely populated hong kong.   it also cited the travel halt imposed by the chinese authorities on thursday, as all flights out of the city were cancelled and trains, buses and ferries suspended.   the moh\u00a0reminded\u00a0the public to continue to exercise caution and pay attention to personal hygiene when travelling to the rest of china.   all travellers should monitor their health closely for two weeks upon returning to singapore and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell, and also inform their doctor of their travel history, said the ministry.   if they have a fever or respiratory symptoms like a cough or runny nose, they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of the visit.   singapore is stepping up precautionary measures, in anticipation of more travellers in the lead-up to the chinese new year holidays.   the expanded measures include temperature screening for all travellers arriving from china \u2013 not just wuhan alone \u2013 at changi airport from wednesday\u00a0and issuing health advisory notices to them.   \u201chowever, people who are in the incubation period \u2013 likely seven to 14 days based on known characteristics of other corona viruses \u2013 might not have started showing symptoms such as a fever, and, hence, not be detected by the thermal scanners,\u201d said raffles medical\u2019s dr wong.   \u201cwith increased awareness of the infection, it is hoped that those who experience symptoms would isolate themselves and see a doctor as soon as possible so as to prevent spreading the infection.\u201d   there is no specific treatment to cure illnesses caused by human coronaviruses, including pneumonia caused by the wuhan virus.   patients typically recover on their own after some time by depending on their immune system to fight the infection.   treatment mostly involves tackling flu-like symptoms from infections and making patients more comfortable, such as providing them with breathing apparatus to help with breathing difficulties.   in some cases, antiviral \ndrugs are available to shorten the duration or reduce the severity of the illness by decreasing the ability of the coronavirus to reproduce, effectively isolating it.   a*star's dr maurer-stroh said that \"as a rule of thumb, a virus that spreads widely is often less severe\".   a flu vaccine will not help protect you against the wuhan coronavirus. there is no vaccine to protect against coronaviruses. the influenza virus, that a flu jab protects against, is not a coronavirus.   however, according to an advisory from raffles medical, you should still get a flu jab if you are travelling to exposed areas to prevent you from contracting influenza symptoms and signs that may mislead screening authorities at temperature checkpoints.

virulently than the virus itself. bubbles are a form of social contagion. when the markets are soaring, \u201cfear of missing out\u201d drives investors. they lose the capacity to make reasoned judgments. herd-like behaviour and groupthink prevail. bullish narratives proliferate. it\u2019s not just that speculators want to hear such stories: wall street is incentivised to circulate them. optimistic visions are maintained in the face of contradictory evidence. during the late 1990s dotcom boom, for instance, wall street claimed that internet traffic was doubling every ten weeks. in fact, as researcher andrew odlyzko, now at the university of minnesota, revealed at the time, traffic was growing one-tenth that fast. this inconvenient finding was ignored, and the investment splurge continued, leading to billions of dollars in misallocated capital and the bankruptcy of numerous telecoms firms, including worldcom. the coronavirus panic has a familiar ring. charts of reported italian deaths rising vertically recall bitcoin\u2019s trajectory a couple of years ago. friends and contacts have taken to forwarding articles by an alarmist coronavirus commentator (not a professional epidemiologist) who boasts millions of readers and claims that his article is the only thing you\u2019ll ever need to read, and will save lives. it\u2019s impossible to say whether this advice is sound or not. but it certainly feels like the pandemic mirror image to the wall street pied pipers, such as henry blodget, who loudly played their tunes during the internet bubble. trust the experts, we are told: follow the data and science. if only things were that simple. during the internet and real estate bubbles, financial experts were wrong. a top hedge fund manager once complained to me that \u201cevery bubble has an academic shill.\u201d epidemiology, like finance, is as much art as science. a colleague and i once gathered data on every bubble we could find. each one \nturned out to be different. epidemiologists face the same problem \u2013 as they like to joke, \u201cif you\u2019ve seen one pandemic, you\u2019ve seen\u2026 one pandemic.\u201d both investors and epidemiologists face chronic uncertainty. during an epidemic, the data is always changing. differences in climate and social behavior affect the spread of disease across geographies. this poses enormous challenges when trying to model a pandemic. like investment strategists, epidemiologists are prone to egregious forecasting errors. in september 2014, the centers for disease control and prevention forecast 1.4 million cases of ebola in west africa by the following january. in the end, this epidemic produced fewer than a reported 30,000 cases. an earlier cdc model anticipated a potential smallpox outbreak would result in 77 trillion deaths \u2013 as kucharski says, both models included an unlimited number of susceptible people. covid-19\u2019s true infection rate is unknown, as outside of south korea testing has been inadequate and no antibody test is yet available. china cannot be trusted to provide accurate data. as for the fatality rate, italians may be recording deaths due to coronavirus when other illnesses may also be prevalent. last week imperial college predicted more than 2 million people would die in the united states and half a million in the united kingdom if covid-19 was not suppressed. imperial\u2019s dire warning persuaded the u.s. and uk governments into draconian action, shuttering large swathes of the economy. on monday, boris johnson locked down great britain. yet the assumptions in imperial\u2019s model \u2013 the reproduction rate, fatality rate, etc. \u2013 are at best educated guesses. the model\u2019s predictions must be hugely sensitive to slight changes in a variety of inputs. even imperial admits that what it calls \u201cconservative\u201d assumptions are pessimistic. such pessimism, or call it excessive caution, appears to be the institutional bias of epidemiologists, just as finance types are prone to hyper-optimism. \ndissenting forces can be heard through the noise. stanford university epidemiologist john ioannidis states that analysis of the outbreak on the diamond princess cruise ship suggests the virus is much less of a danger to life than commonly assumed. also drawing on the cruise experience, michael levitt, the stanford biophysicist and nobel laureate, makes a similar point. \u201cwhat we need to control is the panic,\u201d levitt told the los angeles times. \u201cwe\u2019re going to be fine.\u201d this calls to mind franklin d. roosevelt\u2019s words to the american people in his first inaugural address at the depth of the great depression in 1933: \u201cthe only thing we have to fear is... fear itself \u2013 nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyses needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.\u201d when the history of this pandemic is written, it may become a postscript to the ever-expanding volume, \u201cextraordinary popular delusions and the madness of crowds\u201d, first published in 1841.

"}, {"content": "Birth of a martyr. Even his death seems to have been the subject of manipulation: The doctor Li Wenliang had warned his compatriots as one of the first before the new coronavirus. The police brought him to silence, called him a \"rumor widespread\". Then Li even suffered from pulmonary disease. In the night to Friday local time in Wuhan, the doctor died. In China's social media, it is now speculated that the authorities LIS doctors have stopped far after midnight to rescue measures to pretend he is still alive - though messages have lis heart already on Thursday evening at 21.30 pm to beat. Over hours, an unreal spectacle took place on the net: the party fistail global Times reported at half past half clock Lis death. Millions of Chinese and Chinese expressed their shock. The World Health Organization expressed her condolences on Twitter. Then the message spread, Li was still alive. or not? After midnight reported reporter, Li died at 00:04. The Wuhan Xinhua hospital demented. Finally, the authorities reported: Li Wenliang had died at 02.58. At the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities of the World Health Organization WHO reported an accumulation of pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause in the Central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the diseases. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days then a group released a group of the virologen Christian's premier from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 the first diagnostic test for the new virus, the researcher provisionally call 2019-NCOV. With the test, the virus can be detected in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, on which, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market became \nClosed and disinfected. Both the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as well as Mers (MIDDLE East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses which have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more than 750 died. With the MERS virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronaviruses. Many of them relate to respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example. In China, several thousand persons are suffering from them, some of them - most of them with pre-existing conditions - have died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first infection cases outside of China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been in Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection with a tourist, who came back from Wuhan, on January 24, the first cases were known in France. Meanwhile, first cases were confirmed in Germany. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. The virus can cause pneumonia that can endally end. Since it is a viral illness, antibiotics do not help. Meanwhile, it is clear that the virus can be transferred from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transfers after a dozen cases were known in medical staff. Medizors assume that the virus is transmitted above all over droplet infection. The World Health Organization calculates, as announced on January 24, at the moment that an infected one cuts 1.4 to 2.5 other people. Contest these numbers, the virus is less contagious than SARS and also the \nVirus flu. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals. That can not be said yet. The World Health Organization said on 28 January that about one-fifth of the reported cases through the virus will be seriously ill, so in case of doubt must be treated intensive care. According to reports, the first death pots were patients who had some severe pre-existing conditions. Even with other infectious diseases, people with pre-existing diseases are particularly endangered - for example at the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so change their genome. This can cause you to become more dangerous for people in the course of an outbreak - but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) expects no similar mortality to the current time as the outbreak of SARS. Did the government deliberately delay the message at hours to prevent indignation in the network? A wiser strategy would have been probably to acquire him as hero and to blame individual provincial screets in Wuhan. But that's how the disaster is perfect for the government in Beijing: Already in recent weeks, the 34-year-old ophthalmologist Li had become an icon. On December 30, 2019, he had warned in a chat group in front of a novel pathogen. The police sought him at night at night and pointed him to silence. At the end of January, Li was then positively tested for the Coronavirus 2019-NCOV. His wife expects a second child. She too has now infected. His parents also. Li is one of the youngest dead of the epidemic. Most deceased are much older, usually had pre-existing conditions. Whether it gave complications with LIS disease is not known. In the grief over his death, the Chinese society is now arranged \nLike for many years. Hardly anyone makes his fate untouched. Li was not a dissident, no cross -ulant intellectual or artist, no uighure in the remote Xinjiang. But a young ophthalmologist with lace diploma, Han Chinese from the middle class, handsome for that. Li was not offside the mainstream society, but in the middle. Li is the ideal martyr. \"In a healthy society, it should not only be a kind of voice\" - this sentence sent Li a few days ago from his hospital bed. He will now become a fanal. Many mourners spent a sleepless night. Freedom ofwill was on Friday morning at five o'clock of the Weibo Hashtag of the Hour. Two million times he was clicked until he disappeared. At six o'clock, then #wirswollen press freedom began to trend three million clicks. This hashtag was also deleted. The wave of anger and grief in the social media is unbroken. From the whole country post people candle pictures and drawings of Li with barbed wire as mouthguard - with photos, the censorship can be easily dealt with. A commentator writes: \"Lis death is a day of the national shame.\" Recruites describe Li as a buddy of next door, someone who went into slippers to the ice cream parlor and regular guest was at the popular Haidilao Hotpot chain. Everyone in China can identify with him. A nightmare for communist leadership. Because hardly anything fear Beijing's autocrats as much as the death of a hero. The reason for this is the Chinese story enough: In 1913, an assassination of the founder of the Kuomintang party triggered a revolt against the President of the President. In 1976, people took the death of the Prime Minister Zhou Enlais as an opportunity to facilitate against the four-sands, that group of officials from the left wing of the state party, which already exercised next to Mao Zedong. and in 1989, commemoration of the popular Secretary General Hu Yaobang led to the student movement of \nTiananmen. Again and again, the Chinese mourning paint knew as well as the color of protests. Beijing has now responded to the outrage on the net: a party companion should investigate the questions of the population to the Case Li Wenliang, says. Many should not soothe that: \"Remember the rage you feel today,\" says an appeal that is now viral. Follow the entire coverage of the coronavirus on our topic page. "}, {"content": "Inaction from Southeast Asia can cause a greater expansion of Coronavirus. The coronavirus of Wuhan (2019-NECOP) expands rapidly by Southeast Asia. With more than half a hundred cases confirmed to date, it is the most affected region in the world. But not all the countries of the environment, most with precarious health systems and very dependent on tourism and Chinese investments, have reacted with a premure. The situation in places like Thailand, the most damaged country after the second world economy with 19 contagion, shoots especially the alarms. For his part, Philippines announced this Sunday the first death out of Asian power: a 44-year-old Chinese male. \"Although the numbers (of contagion) outside China are relatively low, there is a potential for a much greater outbreak,\" warned the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros ADHANOM GHEBRAYESUS, by declaring the international emergency on Thursday By the expansion of Coronavirus, which on February 2 leaves a balance of 304 deaths and more than 14,000 infected around the world. A largely founded decision, he explained, in the need to protect those countries that \"do not have the means for their control\". Southeast Asia is a key area in this regard. But although the declaration of the emergency implies a coordination of the international response under WHO, possible new measures could be late in some cases. Thailand already has 19 contagion: one of them is a Thai taxi driver who had displaced four others affected in his vehicle, all from Hubei (Province of which is capital Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus). The local contagion, also occurred in Japan, shoots the greatest fear of the Thai authorities: the appearance of outbreaks in places with great influx of Chinese tourists. \"You can start with a local scale transmission and then grow at the level \nProvincial, \"he warned the deputy director of the Thai Disease Control Department, Tanarak Plipat. A not too distant possibility if it is taken into account that, as said on Thursday, said Department, still about 10,000 tourists from Wuhan are in Thailand. China on Friday a first flight to repatriate them. Thailand has received a flood of citizen criticism for their crisis management, with the Hashtag \"Crapovernment\" (shit government), counting among the most popular on Twitter last days. The reason: the discontent with the measures taken by the authorities, which until mid-last week did not begin to install thermographic controls for all flights from China. For many Internet users, the country would have preserved the arrival of Chinese tourists to ensure public health. Thailand, where tourism represents between 12% and 20% of GDP, is the first tourist destination of the Chinese abroad. The country calculates losses between 2,200 million and 2,900 million euros due to the fall of Chinese tourism. In addition to the greater or lesser capacity and disposition to implement control measures, another concern is the precariousness of the health systems of many countries in the region. \"We do not know what damage this virus can do if it expands in a country with a weak health system,\" the WHO Director General remarked. Cambodia, one of the poorest countries in Southeast Asia, is a clear example. With a case detected to date, to the health insufficiencies of the country, where Chinese investment has grown exponentially in recent years, another almost more insane obstacle is added: Hun's renewal, its prime minister. \"If the prime minister does not have a mask, why he is going to take her the rest,\" he said this week. Hun Sen, who added that the \"true disease is fear\", ruled out canceling flights from China to not harm the \nMalterecha national economy. Geography is another risk factor. The terrestrial borders of the countries of this region that Lindan with China (Vietnam, with three contagious, and Myanmar and Laos, from momentomed of the pathogen) continue open, unlike Russia, which decreed its closure on Thursday. Indonesia, archipelago of more than 17,000 islands, maintains in observation of two possible contagious and ensures increased controls in their countless points of entry. For its part, although the prosperous Singapore has been the first Southeast Asian country to impose the most drastic measures to stop the propagation of the virus, prohibiting entry to all travelers who have been in China in the last two weeks, cases grow daily, reaching 18 February 2. Two of the contagious are women Singaporeans who were repatriated from Wuhan last Thursday. Until a few days free from the pathogen, the Philippines has been the first country outside of China to record a death due to Coronavirus: a 44-year-old Chinese citizen who had arrived from Wuhan with the woman of him, also infected. At the moment they are the only two cases in this country, which hours before death was confirmed, announced the ban on all travel from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macao. With China as the main source of tourists for the majority of Southeast Asia, restrictions on entrances of citizens of this country are a hard blow to their economies. Malaysia, where there are eight contagious, has dismissed a controversial popular request to ban the entry to every Chinese citizen. Tourism has then become a double-edged gun for Southeast Asia. Although it is estimated that it is the main source of contagion, with the Chinese traveling up to ten times more abroad than in 2003, according to the Capital Consultant Economics - in full SARS epidemic, another coronavirus arisen at China - the importance of the sector in the region \nIt seems to discourage drastic decision making.

with young centre half japhet tanganga filling in at left back at vicarage road. \u201cthe reason why he wasn\u2019t selected against middlesbrough is because we have a young left back that we want to

to see the home side through. before remy\u2019s last-gap equaliser, lyon had gone ahead five minutes from time when moussa dembele cancelled out sanches\u2019s opener in the first half at the groupama stadium. lyon, who had a see-saw first half of the season, have now won four of their last five games in all competitions and are still chasing the league cup, french cup and champions league. they will meet stade de reims or paris st germain, who face each other on wednesday, in the league cup final. lyon are bidding to claim the trophy for the second time. lille took the lead in the 12th minute when sanches fired home from just inside the box but lyon were level four minutes later with a dembele penalty after gabriel magalhaes handled. the home side thought they had secured victory in the 85th minute when aouar\u2019s floating strike went past keeper leo jardim but rafael\u2019s poor tackle on jonathan bamba earned lille a stoppage-time penalty that was coolly converted by remy. with no extra time being played in the league cup since the 2017 edition, the contest went straight to a penalty shootout in which lyon converted all of their spot kicks. this is the last

disallowed as they exited the competition in a remarkable game. lazio had won their last six matches in all competitions while napoli had lost four out of six \u2014 including three at home \u2014 since gennaro \ngattuso replaced carlo ancelotti in december, plunging them into a crisis. \u201cwe\u2019ve been through an embarrassing period but today the lads have played a great match against the

\u201cwe need to keep playing with this hunger and this venom.\u201d insigne gave napoli a much-needed boost when he collected the ball on the left, skipped past his marker and side-footed a low shot past thomas strakosha and into the far corner after two minutes. there was more drama as lazio won a penalty in the 10th minute after elseid hysaj bundled over felipe caicedo but immobile, serie a\u2019s leading scorer with 23 goals, slipped as he ran up to take the spot kick and scooped the ball harmlessly wide. hysaj, who had been booked over the penalty, lunged into immobile and was given a second yellow card after only 19 minutes. yet six minutes later, lazio midfielder lucas leiva was booked for a foul, then sent off for protesting the decision. \u201clucas got the ball and should not have been booked but he is an experienced player and should not have reacted the way he did,\u201d said lazio coach simone inzaghi. it was not immobile\u2019s night as he had a goal disallowed for offside in the second half and smashed a shot against the crossbar in the 85th minute. lazio\u2019s manuel lazzari also hit the post with a deflected shot and francesco acerbi turned in the rebound but it was ruled out for offside with two minutes left. napoli were also unlucky as arkadiusz milik headed against the inside of the post in the 70th minute and mario rui curled an effort against the upright. \u201cit\u2019s disappointing to lose a match we dominated,\u201d said inzaghi. next month's women's olympic football qualifiers in wuhan have been shifted to nanjing, the asian football

qualifiers final round - group b from wuhan to jiangning football training centre in nanjing,\" the continental governing body said in a statement. the dates of the february 3-9 tournament remain unchanged with top two teams qualifying for the playoff against group b counterparts for the final two places, alongside host japan, at the tokyo olympics. australia has issued a travel warning for wuhan, asking visitors to \"exercise a high degree of caution\", but their head coach said on tuesday they were preparing for a wuhan trip. australia play taiwan on february 3, thailand three days later and china on february 9. taiwan's football association said on wednesday the sports administration had asked the afc in december to change the location due to fears about the health of players. if the venue was not changed then taiwan's team would not participate, the association added. taiwan, where one case of the coronavirus has been detected, has called on people not to visit wuhan unless they absolutely have to. the asian football confederation (afc) has shifted two preliminary matches in its elite club competition from iran to neutral venues because of security concerns, asian soccer's governing body said on wednesday. shahr khodro fc were scheduled to host bahrain's riffa and esteghlal fc were set to play kuwait sc on tuesday but both asian champions league matches were postponed after several governments issued warnings against travelling to iran. \"to help facilitate the switch to neutral venues, which has been approved by the relevant afc committees, the afc will now reschedule the games to january 25, 2020 in the united arab emirates,\" the afc said in a statement. local media reported \nthat the four iranian clubs in the competition, including persepolis and sepahan, had said they would refuse to play if they cannot host games in the country. the move comes after iranian forces shot down a ukraine international airlines jet in error on jan. 8, killing all 176 on board amid tensions following the assassination by the united states of prominent general qassem soleimani. the afc's decision to move matches out of iran is unprofessional and political, iranian president hassan rouhani's chief of staff, mahmoud vaezi, said on wednesday, according to the official irna news agency. \"this is an unsporting and unprofessional move,\" vaezi said. \"as we examine it we realize this has become a political issue.\" security concerns between iran and its neighbours have affected the involvement of the country's clubs in the asian champions league in the past. since 2016, matches between clubs from iran and saudi arabia have been played in neutral venues due to concerns raised by the saudis over safety issues when travelling to iran. iranian clubs on that occasion also threatened to boycott the competition before relenting, with matches involving teams from the two countries played in oman and, until a saudi-led diplomatic dispute in june 2017, qatar. while they are among the best-supported clubs in asia, no iranian side has won the asian champions league since it was created in 2002, with tehran-based persepolis going closest in 2018 when they lost in the final to japan\u2019s kashima antlers. persepolis have been drawn to meet al duhail from qatar, saudi arabia\u2019s al taawon and united arab emirates champions sharjah in the group phase of this year's competition. sepahan are slated to meet saudi champions al nassr, qatar\u2019s al sadd and a qualifier from the play-offs.

worldwide hunt for protection even as the pandemic surges. with a careful jab in a healthy volunteer's arm, scientists at the kaiser permanente washington research institute in seattle begin an anxiously awaited first-stage study of a potential covid-19 vaccine developed in record time after the new virus exploded from china and fanned across the globe. \"we're team coronavirus now,\" kaiser permanente study leader dr. lisa jackson said on the eve of the experiment. \"everyone wants to do what they can in this emergency.\" the associated press observed as the study's first participant, an operations manager at a small tech company, received the injection inside an exam room. three others were next in line for a test that will ultimately give 45 volunteers two doses, a month apart. \"we all feel so helpless. this is an amazing opportunity for me to do something,\" jennifer haller, 43, of seattle, said as she awaited the shot. she's the mother of two teenagers and \"they think it's cool\" that she's taking part in the study. after the injection, she left the exam room with a big smile: \"i'm feeling great.\" monday's milestone marked just the beginning of a series of studies in people needed to prove whether the shots are safe and could work. even if the research goes well, a vaccine wouldn't be available for widespread use for 12 to 18 months, said dr. anthony fauci of the us national institutes of health. still, finding a vaccine \"is an urgent public health priority,\" fauci said in a statement monday. the new study, \"launched in record speed, is an important first step toward achieving that goal.\" this vaccine candidate, code-named mrna-1273, was developed by the nih and massachusetts-based biotechnology company moderna inc. there's no chance participants could get infected from the shots because \nthey don't contain the coronavirus itself. it's not the only potential vaccine in the pipeline. dozens of research groups around the world are racing to create a vaccine against covid-19. another candidate, made by inovio pharmaceuticals, is expected to begin its own safety study -- in the us, china and south korea -- next month. the seattle experiment got underway days after the world health organization declared the new virus outbreak a pandemic because of its rapid global spread, infecting more than 169,000 people and killing more than 6,500. covid-19 has upended the world's social and economic fabric since china first identified the virus in january, with regions shuttering schools and businesses, restricting travel, canceling entertainment and sporting events, and encouraging people to stay away from each other. starting what scientists call a first-in-humans study is a momentous occasion for scientists, but jackson described her team's mood as \"subdued.\" they've been working round-the-clock readying the research in a part of the us struck early and hard by the virus. still, \"going from not even knowing that this virus was out there ... to have any vaccine\" in testing in about two months is unprecedented, jackson told the ap. some of the study's carefully chosen healthy volunteers, ages 18 to 55, will get higher dosages than others to test how strong the inoculations should be. scientists will check for any side effects and draw blood samples to test if the vaccine is revving up the immune system, looking for encouraging clues like the nih earlier found in vaccinated mice. \"we don't know whether this vaccine will induce an immune response, or whether it will be safe. that's why we're doing a trial,\" jackson stressed. \"it's not at the stage where it would be possible or prudent to give it to the general population.\" most of the vaccine research under way globally targets a protein aptly named \"spike\" that studs the surface of the new coronavirus and lets it \ninvade human cells. block that protein and people won't get infected. researchers at the nih copied the section of the virus' genetic code that contains the instructions for cells to create the spike protein. moderna encased that \"messenger rna\" into a vaccine. the idea: the body will become a mini-factory, producing some harmless spike protein. when the immune system spots the foreign protein, it will make antibodies to attack -- and be primed to react quickly if the person later encounters the real virus. that's a much faster way of producing a vaccine than the traditional approach of growing virus in the lab and preparing shots from either killed or weakened versions of it. but because vaccines are given to millions of healthy people, it takes time to test them in large enough numbers to spot an uncommon side effect, cautioned dr. nelson michael of the walter reed army institute of research, which is developing a different vaccine candidate. \"the science can go very quickly but, first, do no harm, right?\" he told reporters last week. the seattle research institute is part of a government network of centers that test all kinds of vaccines, and was chosen for the coronavirus vaccine study before covid-19 began spreading widely in washington state. kaiser permanente screened dozens of people, looking for those who have no chronic health problems and aren't currently sick. researchers aren't checking whether would-be volunteers already had a mild case of covid-19 before deciding if they're eligible. if some did, scientists will be able to tell by the number of antibodies in their pre-vaccination blood test and account for that, jackson said. participants will be paid $100 for each clinic visit in the study.

cancelled holiday plans in the face of tightening travel restrictions. or mayhap, complacency has set in. the world\u2019s medical community has, after all, touted the singaporean government\u2019s rigorous measures against the spread of covid-19 as the gold standard for keeping the disease in check. whatever it is, our island this past weekend was not the ghost town it resembled a month ago after the dorscon orange alert was sounded. it was jam-packed everywhere we went: at a kopitiam in upper serangoon, a mom-and-pop bakery in tiong bahru, a chic new restaurant on purvis street, a chinese fine-diner in orchard road, a yakun outlet in ion orchard, and the food basement at takashimaya. all were thronged with people as if it were 2019 during the great singapore sale, back when we weren\u2019t in the thick of, you know, a pandemic.    the government has advised singaporeans to practise social distancing. what is social distancing, you ask? the idea is to maintain a distance between you and other people \u2014 in this case, at least six feet (about two metres). that also means minimising contact with people, says the new york times. this is important as there is no vaccine for covid-19 yet, and social distancing is the only thing that works in lessening the spread of the disease now. china\u2019s drastic drop in new cases within the virus\u2019s epicenter in wuhan is proof enough that this method has its merits.    \u201ci think when you are dealing with an epidemic of a new virus, you are never complacent about it. for both china and singapore, we may have handled the first phase reasonably well, but we will not be complacent. you should not sound the all-clear,\u201d warns minister for foreign affairs vivian balakrishnan in an interview with cnbc. sage advice, especially when our neighbour, malaysia, announced last night that it will enforce \na \u201crestricted movement order\u201d, which bans citizens from going overseas and foreigners from entering the country for roughly two weeks starting 18 march. the lockdown is in response to a sharp spike of cases in malaysia. meanwhile, the disease has brought europe to its knees, with italy having an alarming number of deaths that are already half of china\u2019s total. american cities like new york have shut down schools, theatres, bars and even restaurants. some speculate that the virus may soon blow up in the rest of south east asia, where a lot of testing is done haphazardly at best \u2014 our country has seen a few imported cases from indonesia, and it has since imposed restrictions on medical tourists trying to seek treatment here.    singaporeans know all of this. yet, this was what we witnessed last weekend.photo: this is hunan/facebook   this scene greeted us at old-school bakery tiong bahru galicier pastry: a line of 15 people in its cramped premises, standing mere inches away from each other. perhaps unwisely, we pressed on as we promised to buy its yummy white coconut kueh dadar, ondeh ondeh and kueh puteri ayu for our parents. with health experts\u2019 advice to maintain a two-metre (some say four) gap between strangers ringing in our head, we pointedly gave a wide berth between ourselves and the lady in front. our efforts were soon scuppered when an auntie rushed up behind us, invading our personal space like a nosy mother who flings open her teenage son\u2019s bedroom door at midnight without knocking. we stepped away in an attempt to put some distance between us. she inched closer. we strode ahead again and she shadowed us once more like a bad movie sequel. rinse and miserably repeat. \u201chey auntie, do you mind not standing so close please?\u201d we finally blurted, not caring if we sounded like a paranoid germophobe (we\u2019d rather be safe than sorry). to her credit, she backtracked quickly, darting her eyes nervously around. we relaxed a little. soon, it was our turn to order at the \ncake counter. as we fumbled for cash, we felt someone with clammy skin brushing up against us. hello again, auntie. in her haste, she probably thought skin-to-skin contact would result in faster service. we damn near sprinted out of the shop. \u201cyou should\u2019ve faked a coughing fit, everyone in the queue would\u2019ve definitely steered clear,\u201d jokes a friend after we related this harrowing tale.           the retro bakery is famous for its yummy white coconut kueh dadar.   8days.sg reader a. wong told us after seeing our insta story: \u201cthat\u2019s not the worst. i was queuing to pay for (uncovered) breads on a tray at breadtalk when the lady in front of me turned back and coughed. it was my turn next and so the cashier rung up my order. the lady who coughed wasn\u2019t masked \u2014 i was shocked. coincidentally, she did not \u2018infect\u2019 her purchases but instead aimed her cough behind her [at me] \u2014 no social responsibility. i later binned the bread for peace of mind. my family and friends told me i shouldn't have paid for it and should have gotten new ones, but everything took place in a short span of time and in hindsight, it might have been for the best so that the possibly germy bread wouldn\u2019t make its way back to the shelf.\u201d how ghastly. pictured: a line with zero social distancing at donq bakery in takashimaya.       a korean banchan store in takashimaya\u2019s food basement teemed with customers \u2014 both locals and tourists \u2014 clamouring for samples last weekend. as we waited to be served, we felt an unholy gust of wind against the back of our neck. as we swivelled to find its source, a middle-aged guy with his mug several inches from ours bellowed in mandarin: \u201ci want spicy anchovies!\u201d we recoiled in horror and glared at him. he jerked back almost comically, embarrassed realisation creeping up on his face as he acknowledged he did a totally uncool thing in the time of covid-19. the irony? he was wearing a surgical mask \u2014 but it was pulled down to reveal his nose and mouth. it stared at us \nmockingly from the depths of his chin. as if our nerves weren't already frayed enough, the shop assistant then coughed very lightly as she scooped up our anchovies. she may have done this through a mask, but it looked rather flimsy. we get that she couldn't cover her mouth because her hands were busy scooping up our food and that her throat probably tickled so uncontrollably she couldn't help herself \u2014 but perhaps turn the other way? needless to say, we changed our mind about wanting those little fish after all. on a brighter note, the sour & spicy kimchi that we finally tapowed home was pretty appetising.    even upmarket cafes like bacha coffee in ion orchard, which is like a glittering java version of twg\u2019s swish teahouses, didn\u2019t have a single empty seat last sunday afternoon. there was a mid-length but tightly-packed line of people waiting to enter the busy dining room.           why do some restaurants still do this when every single thing you put into your mouth is met with suspicion these days? it\u2019s gross even pre-covid-19, quite irresponsible now. at the two trendy new restaurants we visited last week, we asked for serving spoons for communal dishes. both times, the waiters simply left the cutlery resting on our bare table. one of them also used a musty-smelling cloth to wipe said table just minutes earlier. ideally, eateries should place silverware onto plates, wrap them up in napkins, or only provide them directly to the diner when their food is served.        go out if you must \u2014 small f&b businesses in particular need your love during this difficult period. but do so wisely: avoid overcrowded places, maintain a safe distance from strangers where possible, keep your person to yourself (no brushing up against people, please). and for the love of all things that are good, cover your mouth when you cough and wash your hands immediately after. do your part to help flatten the curve and protect not just yourself, but loved ones who\u2019re vulnerable to the virus. \ncan\u2019t or won\u2019t do it? then it\u2019s far safer to endure cabin fever at home instead of being struck down with one of the viral kind. photos: florence fong "}, {"content": "athletes unite to fight common rival. dublin \u2022 conor mcgregor, the

As the Chinese state television reported, flights, trains, ferries and long-distance buses should be stopped from Thursday morning.\nResidents Wuhans are therefore allowed to leave the Central Chinese city only stating special reasons. In the city where the novel coronavirus had probably broken out on an animal market, around eleven million people live.\nIn addition, people were asked to take public only with protective masks. Anyone who does not wear a mask in hotels, restaurants, shopping centers or parks will be punished, reported the newspaper \"China Daily\". Wuhan is particularly difficult to affect the disease. The virus has now spread in large parts of China and also beyond the national borders. The disease had already been demonstrated in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the USA.\nBecause more and more people with flu symptoms are tested for the new virus, the number of confirmed cases continues to increase. By Thursday, the virus was demonstrated at 571 people, as the Chinese health authority reported. Among them are 95 heavy cases, all of which lie in the province of Hubei with the particularly difficult metropolis Wuhan.\nDespite the rapid increase in proven infections with the new virus, the World Health Organization (WHO) exclaimed no \"health emergency of international scope\" for the time being. The Emergency Committee, who advises the WHO, did not see any occasion on Wednesday, but wanted again on Thursday.

However, the members of the emergency committee in the assessment of the situation should not have been consent.\nWith an official \"emergency\", further concrete recommendations would have been connected to states to contain the spread over borders as possible.

The EU Prevention Authority ECDC spoke of a moderate risk that the pathogen is introduced into the European Union. It was still unclear how severe and how fatally the disease was, ECDC Director Andrea Ammon said.\nIt is believed that the source of Coronavirus was a wild animal on a fish market in Wuhan. After expert opinion, it was initially transferred from the animal to humans before the virus adapted to his new host and came to transfers between people. With the travel wave to the Chinese New Year next Saturday, the risk of spreading the viral disease is growing. At the largest annual travel wave of the country, a few hundred million Chinese are on the way.\nThe new virus belongs to the same kind as that, which has triggered the SARS pandemic in 2002/2003. At that time, about 800 people came to life. The new virus should be a more harmless variant according to the current state.

and around wuhan or people with connections the city. other cases have been confirmed in the united states, japan, taiwan, south korea and thailand. singapore and vietnam reported their first cases thursday, and cases have also been \nconfirmed in the chinese territories of hong kong and macao. many countries are screening travelers from china for symptoms of the virus, which can cause fever, coughing, breathing difficulties and pneumonia. the world health organization has decided against declaring the outbreak a global emergency, a step that can bring more money and resources to fight a threat but that can also cause trade and travel restrictions and other economic damage, making the decision a politically fraught one. the decision \"should not be taken as a sign that who does not think the situation is serious or that we're not taking it seriously. nothing could be further from the truth,\" who director general, tedros adhanom ghebreyesus, said. \"who is following this outbreak every minute of every day.\" chinese officials have not said how long the shutdowns of the cities will last. while sweeping measures are typical of china's communist party-led government, large-scale quarantines are rare around the world, even in deadly epidemics, because of concerns about infringing on people's liberties. and the effectiveness of such measures is unclear. \"to my

at this stage say it will or it will not work.\" jonathan ball, a professor of virology at molecular virology at the university of nottingham in britain, said the lockdowns appear to be justified scientifically. \"until there's a better understanding of what the situation is, i think it's not an unreasonable thing to do,\" he said. \"anything that limits people's travels during an outbreak would obviously work.\" but ball cautioned that any such quarantine should be strictly time-limited. he added: \"you have to make sure you communicate effectively about why this is being done. otherwise you will lose the goodwill of the people.\" during the devastating west \nafrica ebola outbreak in 2014, sierra leone imposed a national three-day quarantine as health workers went door to door, searching for hidden cases. burial teams collecting corpses and people taking the sick to ebola centers were the only ones allowed to move freely. frustrated residents complained of food shortages. in china, the illnesses from the newly identified coronavirus first appeared last month in wuhan, an industrial and transportation hub. local authorities demanded all residents wear masks in public places and urged civil servants wear them at work. after the city was closed off thursday, images showed long lines and empty shelves at supermarkets, as people stocked up. trucks carrying supplies into the city are not being restricted, although many chinese recall shortages in the years before the country's recent economic boom. analysts predicted cases will continue to multiply, although the jump in numbers is also attributable in part to increased monitoring. \"even if (cases) are in the thousands, this would not surprise us,\" the who's galea said, adding, however, that the number of infected is not an indicator of the outbreak's severity so long as the death rate remains low. the coronavirus family includes the common cold as well as viruses that cause more serious illnesses, such as the sars outbreak that spread from china to more than a dozen countries in 2002-03 and killed about 800 people, and middle eastern respiratory syndrome, or mers, which is thought to have originated from camels. china is keen to avoid repeating mistakes with its handling of sars. for months, even after the illness had spread around the world, china parked patients in hotels and drove them around in ambulances to conceal the true number of cases and avoid who experts. this time, china has been credited with sharing information rapidly, and president xi jinping has emphasized

"}, {"content": "covid-19: critically ill chinese patient saved by stem cell therapy, study says. hong kong \u2014 a 65-year-old chinese woman who fell seriously ill after being infected with the coronavirus made a startling recovery after being given stem cell therapy, according to a new study by chinese scientists.   the patient had been fighting for her life in the intensive care unit at baoshan hospital in kunming, the capital of southwest china's yunnan province, for nearly two weeks after contracting covid-19, the disease caused by the virus.   but according to a paper published by a team of researchers from kunming university led by dr hu min, just four days after being given her first shot of umbilical cord stem cells, the woman was back on her feet and able to walk.   \"although only one case was shown here, it could be very important and inspire similar clinical practices in treating critically ill covid-19 patients,\" said the study, which was published on thursday (feb 27) on chinaxiv.org, a platform for the release of scientific papers that have yet to be peer-reviewed.   the treatment \"might be an ideal choice to be used or combined with other immune modulating agents\", it said.   the yunnan case is one of 14 trials using stem cells to treat coronavirus patients in china, according to the world health organization's (who) clinical trial database. while the technology remains controversial, there is hope among health authorities and medical professionals that it could become a lifesaver for critically ill patients.   the patient in kunming arrived in the city on jan 21 on a flight from wuhan, the capital of central china's hubei province and the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak. a week later she fell ill with a mild fever, fatigue and coughing, so went to a public hospital where she tested positive for covid-19. from there she was transferred to baoshan hospital.   following the strict guidelines laid down by the government for the treatment of coronavirus patients, \ndoctors there first administered antiviral medications and antibiotics, and put the woman\u00a0\u2014 who also suffers from type 2 diabetes\u00a0\u2014 on oxygen to help her breathe. her condition improved initially but then went rapidly downhill and she was moved to the intensive care unit on feb 1.   things did not improve, and as the woman's health worsened and her organs began to fail, the doctors needed to act fast. so, after consulting the hospital's ethics committee and the patient's family, the stem cell therapy was started on feb 9.   stem cells are highly adaptive early-stage cells that evolve into different types of fully functioning cells to produce tissue, organs or body fluids. the ones used in the kunming study came from a laboratory culture of umbilical cords from newborn babies.   the doctors considered using stem cell therapy because covid-19 has been shown in other studies to cause severe damage to the lungs, liver and other organs. tests conducted on animals suggested stem cells might be able to repair that damage.   according to the paper, the kunming patient was given the first of three shots on feb 9. after showing no adverse effects to that initial dose she was given a second three days later. on feb 13, she was able to get out of bed and take a short walk with only limited help.   she was given her final shot on feb 15, and two days later was able to leave the intensive care unit and go back to a regular ward. her vital signs had returned to normal and a throat swab test for covid-19 came back negative.   according to dr li honghui, who is involved in similar trials at loudi central hospital in central china's hunan province, stem cell injections can deliver significant results within three days.   \"we cannot stick to the rules, we must be bold and innovative,\" he was quoted as saying in a report by hunan daily last week.   mr zhang xinmin, director of biological technology at the ministry of science and technology in beijing, told a press conference on \nfebruary 15 that the preliminary results of stem cell experiments conducted across the country suggested the technology was \"safe and effective\".   hospitals in huanggang, one of the worst hit cities in hubei, received their first shipment of stem cell shots last week and they would be given to three critically ill patients, state media reported.   another paper published on chinaxiv on friday said that seven coronavirus patients in beijing had been given stem cell therapy and responded in a similar way to the woman in kunming.   stem cell technology emerged in the 1980s but remains highly controversial. scientists initially considered using human embryos as the source for the cells, but the idea drew fire on ethical grounds.   the research community responded by proposing alternative methods for harvesting stem cells, such as turning normal tissue cells into stem cells, but those efforts were tarnished by a series of scandals in the united states, japan and south korea involving the fabrication of experimental data.   in china, scientists are engaged in cutting edge research on stem cells. while the use of cells from healthy embryos is forbidden, scientists are permitted to use fertilised eggs discarded due to illness or defects.   a doctor treating coronavirus patients in beijing, who asked not to be named, said there was a growing discussion within the medical community about the potential benefits of stem cell therapy.   \"the stem cell industry may have some vested interest to promote their technology in this crisis, but if it really works, it should be made available to more patients,\" she said. south china morning post "}, {"content": "in brief:

"coronavirus impact comes into focus: how it spreads, infects. the medical impact of the new coronavirus is coming into sharper focus as it continues its spread in what is now officially recognized as a pandemic. its true fatality rate isn't yet known, but it seems 10 times higher than the flu, which kills hundreds of thousands around the world each year, the united states' top infectious disease expert told lawmakers last week. most people have had mild to moderate illness and recovered, but the virus is more serious for those who are older or have other health problems. that's a huge number, said dr. tom frieden, a former director of the centers for disease control and prevention who now heads a global health organization. in the u.s., 60% of adults have at least one underlying health condition and 42% have two or more. \"there's still a lot that we don't know\" about the virus and disease it causes, covid-19, he said. how it spreads most spread is from droplets produced when an infected person coughs, which are inhaled by people nearby. transmission from touching contaminated surfaces hasn't been shown yet, though recent tests by u.s. scientists suggest it's possible -- one reason they recommend washing your hands and not touching your face. the virus can live in the air for several hours, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. cleaning surfaces with solutions containing diluted bleach should kill it. \"while we are still learning about the biology of this virus, it does not appear that there is a major risk of spread through sweat,\" said julie fischer, a georgetown university microbiologist. the biggest concern about going to the gym is infected people coughing on others, or contaminating shared surfaces or equipment, she said. consider avoiding large classes and peak hours and don't go if you're coughing or feverish, she suggests. the risk of virus transmission from food servers is the same risk as transmission from \nother infected people, but \"one of the concerns in that food servers, like others facing stark choices about insurance and paychecks, may be pressured to work even if they are sick,\" she said. how fast does it spread? each infected person spreads to two or three others on average, researchers estimate. it spreads more easily than flu but less than measles, tuberculosis or some other respiratory diseases. it is not known if it spreads less easily among children, but fewer of them have been diagnosed with the disease. a study of 1,099 patients in china found that 0.9% of the cases were younger than 15. what are the symptoms? most people get fever and cough, sometimes fatigue or shortness of breath, and recover after about two weeks. about 15% develop severe disease, including pneumonia, chinese scientists reported from 45,000 cases there. symptoms usually start slowly and often worsen as the illness goes on. in a report last week on the first 12 patients in the u.s., seven were hospitalized; most had underlying health problems and got worse during the second week of illness. in china, slightly more males have been diagnosed with covid-19 than females, which might be because roughly half of chinese men smoke but only 5% of females do, frieden said. children seem to get less sick -- a report on 10 in china found that fevers tended to be milder and they lacked clear signs of pneumonia. what does it feel like? some cruise ship passengers described symptoms similar to the common cold or flu. \"it's been a 2 on a scale of 10,\" said carl goldman, who was hospitalized in omaha, nebraska, after flying home. however, a chinese postgraduate student described going to the hospital twice after her symptoms worsened, and feeling \"a heavy head while walking, unable to breathe, and nauseous.\" what's the test like? the cdc recommends at least two swabs -- nose and throat. samples are sent to labs that look for bits of viral genetic material, which takes roughly 4 to 6 hours. \naltogether, it can take several days to ship a sample and get results back. it's been taking two to three days, and \"we are working really hard to see if we can shorten that time\" by developing an in-house test, dr. aimee moulin of the university of california, davis said thursday in a conference call held by the american college of emergency physicians. some areas have opened drive-thru sites for testing, which could reduce exposure to health workers and other patients or the public. when is the virus most contagious? the average time from exposure to developing symptoms is five to six days, but can be up to two weeks. tests have found high amounts of virus in the throats and noses of people a couple days before they show symptoms. signs of virus also have been found in stool weeks after patients recover, but that doesn't mean it's capable of causing illness, scientists warn. \"the virus can be degraded,\" said robert webster, a st. jude children's research center virus expert. \"it's not necessarily infectious virus at all.\" how deadly is it? that won't be known until large studies are done to test big groups of people to see how many have been infected and with or without symptoms. scientists have estimated the fatality rate from less than 1% to as high as 4% among cases diagnosed so far, depending on location. flu kills about 0.1% of those it infects, so the new virus seems about 10 times more lethal, the national institutes of health's dr. anthony fauci told congress last week. the death rate has been higher among people with other health problems -- more than 10% for those with heart disease, for example. in the u.s., 30 million have diabetes, more than 70 million are obese and nearly 80 million have high blood pressure. can infected people who recover get it again? it's not known. a few reports from china say some people had covid-19, recovered and then fell ill again. it's unclear if that's a relapse, a new infection, or a case where the person never fully \nrecovered in the first place. scientists at the at the fred hutchinson cancer research center in seattle say the 30,000-letter genetic code of the virus changes by one letter every 15 days. it's not known how many of these changes would be needed for the virus to seem different enough to the immune system of someone who had a previous version of it for it to cause a fresh infection. fauci told congress on thursday that it was unlikely that someone could get reinfected. \"we haven't formally proved it, but it is strongly likely that that's the case,\" he said. \"because if this acts like any other virus, once you recover, you won't get reinfected.\" will it go away in the summer? flu fades each spring and the new virus may do the same, fauci said last week in a podcast with a journal editor. \"i am hoping that as we get into the warmer weather we will see a decline that will give us a chance to get our preparedness up to speed,\" fauci said. but that, too, is far from certain. \"we have to assume that the virus will continue to have the capacity to spread, and it's a false hope to say yes, it will just disappear in the summertime like influenza,\" said dr. michael ryan, the world health organization's emergencies chief. flu viruses also mutate quickly, requiring new vaccines to be made each year. if the coronavirus follows suit, frieden said, \"it could become a virus that circulates around the world for many years to come.\" "}, {"content": "coronavirus: athletes advised to avoid china

According to the increase in the number of patients in China, experts adequately adhere to the new lung disease to Europe is more likely to be more likely. It should not be ruled out that a diseased person travel to Germany, Lars Schaade, Vice President of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) in Berlin said. You have to worry in Germany but do not have to do. \"In the coming days, we have to expect more cases in other parts of China and possibly in other countries,\" explained the spokesman for the World Health Organization (WHO), Tarik Ja\u0161arevi\u0107, on Tuesday in Geneva. That is not unusual: \"If you expand monitoring, it is likely that you are discovered more cases.\" The Health Authority of the Central Chinese Metropolis Wuhan reported further dead by the novel coronavirus. Overall, six deaths are now confirmed, mostly they concerned older people with severe pre-existing conditions. In addition, dozens of further infections were reported on Tuesday. This now has more than 300 confirmed cases in China since the beginning of the outbreak in December. Evidence is also available in Taiwan, Thailand, Japan and South Korea - in all cases diseased people who were previously in Wuhan. \"We have to prepare for ourselves in Germany that at least in individual cases, it comes to introductions of the disease,\" said the Berlin Virus Researcher Christian Road. \"Clinics must then be prepared to isolate the patients.\" The health risk for the population in Germany is currently classified as \"very low\" by the responsible RKI. Although there could be individual cases of imports, continued infection chains - thus subsequent transmissions from man to man - are unlikely to be present, so RKI Vice President Schaade. Also at the Mers-Coronavirus were occasionally infected to Germany, without \nthere then came into other transfers in Germany. The Federal Ministry of Health also estimates the risk to Germany as low. \"Nevertheless, we observe the situation in China at all attention and are in constant exchange with our international partners,\" said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of Health. With the currently running travel wave to the Chinese New Year next Saturday, the risk of spread the virus is growing. In the two-week holiday season around the festival are a few hundred million Chinese traveling, many families companies also joint travel abroad. In addition to destinations in Southeast Asia, traveling to Europe or the USA are also popular. Asian neighbors and airports in other countries such as the US and Australia have meanwhile introduced fever controls when entering Wuhan. The Italian Ministry of Health announced to review suspected cases on board in Rome-bound planes from Wuhan in the future. Pilots should therefore report passengers with corresponding symptoms. These would then immediately be brought into the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Rome, it said. For the time being, there are no special measures at German airports. However, Frankfurt Airport has made preparations. \"The plan is in the drawer,\" said a spokeswoman for the operator company Fraport on Tuesday. If the health department in Frankfurt exemplifies recommendations, they would be implemented. Direct flights from Wuhan to Frankfurt do not give it any. Also, from D\u00fcsseldorf Airport, it was said, so far, the relevant health care authority does not yet take any action required. If there is a suspicion on board a machine direction D\u00fcsseldorf, the pilot would give an indication of the air traffic control or the airport, a spokesman continued to explain. \"The airport would immediately inform the health department and the corresponding machine later in a separate area \nPlace. \"From the Robert Koch Institute, there was no scientific evidence for the effectiveness of so-called entry screenings at airports, ie controls when entering. It makes sense, however, exit screenings in a disease wave are particularly affected areas. The 11 million metropolis Wuhan has already introduced corresponding controls upon departure. The World Health Organization (WHO) has convened its emergency committee because of lung disease. The experts should advise on Wednesday. If the WHO exclaims an international health nightstand, she recommends sharply measures to combat the disease. Among other things, border controls and setting up specialized treatment centers can be included. Currently, WHO recommends no travel or trading restrictions. \"On the basis of the existing information, there is no justification for restrictions of travel or trade,\" said the speaker. \"Should the situation escalate, the WHO could comment on the risks of travel in affected areas.\" The EU Commission also plans to make a meeting to assess the risks through the new lung disease. According to a speaker, the Committee on Health Safety should meet on Thursday. Last Friday, there has been an exchange of EU countries, which was advised on possible reactions to the coronavirus.

"}, {"content": "A New Year without firm. Franka Lu is a Chinese journalist and entrepreneur. She works in China and Germany. In this time-online series, she reports critical about life, culture and everyday life in China. To protect your professional and private environment, she writes under a pseudonym. The coronavirus in China has taken care of for the most unusual spring festival that I have ever experienced. I read and hear from the distance of empty streets in the cities, little fireworks, but a lot of fear of allors, even anger. Travel restrictions make the usual home ride of people to their families hardly possible. The spring festivals I remember, now seem like a dream of a hundred years ago. That fulfills me with almost nostalgic feelings. As Chinese immigrant, in Germany, in winter, I usually have many more opportunities to celebrate than the Germans themselves: for Christmas and New Year, at me, the Chinese Spring Festival is added or the Chinese New Year, which starts between the end of January and mid-February with the turn of the year (this time Fell this on the 25th of January), 15 days lasts and ends with sweet rice balls and the lantern festival. The Germans, on the other hand, beat themselves from the 2nd of January with their post-celebration depression, Easter is barely visible as a light at the end of a very long and cold tunnel. My holiday mood, on the other hand, lasts one or even two months longer, because the lantern festival takes place in the middle until the end of February. For a Chinese living abroad like me, the Chinese New Year's festivities are now a rather virtual thing anyway. In recent years, I have been remotely observed over the social media, as China is almost entirely to a standstill in the two weeks of the Spring Festival, and transformed into a huge, faster carousel, and people travel home, where their families Life. the eleven \nMonths of the year, which are crumpled with work and competition to the attack, go over into a month filled with alcohol and just as heavy familiar competition. The tide of the travelers then usually farmed in all directions across the whole country, it is briefly the biggest human hiking movement worldwide: three billion trips to the family recite was counted during the spring festival 2019, to land, to water or in the air were the scarce 1.4 billion Chinese women on the way. For Europeans, the idea of \u200b\u200bsuch a tremendous amount of travelers may sound abstract, for me to combine the memory of an intensive physical experience when I still lived in China. It always began at least a month earlier when I fought for tickets for airplane, train and bus to be at home in time - in competition with millions by no means less zealous travel searches Chinese women. Then the same competition, the fight for a taxi to be in time at the airport or train station; For at least two to three safety checks, with subtle or non-subtle elbow insert or strategic positioning, to prevent others on the precursor; Knuffe and R\u00fcffel, because I did not move fast enough forward; Occasionally argument and fight for the seat on the train, although I had the ticket with the reservation and the one who sat there, just not ... I have the smell of all the transiters still in the nose: the mixture of strong body duffloffs, cheap plastic bags and trouble Suitcase leather, cleaning agents on marble or concrete floors, the tension of the people like wooden coal smell in the air. So really started the spring festivities only when, for example, the train slowly moved. Relief and happiness. Immediately the fellow travelers opened their pockets on the train, and the scent of all sorts of food was soon \nThe wagons. The less luxurious the journey was, the more food and drinks were shared between passengers. The people asked each other for their professions, families, family status and income, made matching compassional noises or gave unbitted tips on how to deal with private problems. As a young woman, this was everything moving for me and unsettling at the same time. Over the years, not only delicious foods, but also visits to wildframe and even a few potential husbands have been offered on the spring festival. The encounter that has impressed me most, however, took place in a long-distance bus. A young woman in the seat laid next to me, barely she was awakening from a longer sleep, her elbow on my shoulder and began brushing her hair. I met me quietly and let me use without resistance throughout the process as her hairdresser. She seemed to me a working migrant. Maybe she was lonely, and I was just shy. We did not change a single word. Since I could afford aircraft and express train tickets, it has no longer come to intimate encounters of this kind. Trips to the Spring Festival are even less challenging and much more desirable. The good mobile connections along the route made in recent years that instead of talking to the fellow travelers became increasingly heard video and gaming, telephone calls and chats about social media. What has not changed until recently is the ubiquitous food odor. I relied on a German friend at one of my hitherto for the last spring chestnuts, as I unpacked my sailing at the Shanghaier Quick Station packet with spiced duck feet. This is the last rest of the national pride, which I have not got rid of. It used to have some courage, as teenagers - pulled away, but not definitely \nArrived elsewhere - to return to the hometown. In the ancient China one told \u8fd1\u4e61 \u60c5\u602f: the closer you come from the hometown, the more nervous you will. In the west, these mixed feelings are familiar to the people of Christmas. \"You never know what checks you are undergoing through your parents or various relatives. This mixture of yearning after homecoming and fear of such attacks we call ... Schr\u00f6dingers Spring Festival.\" Thus, the prelude to a song that is very popular among young towns in China, tips for self-help at the Spring Festival, sung by the rainbow choir from Shanghai. The hashtag named after the lyrics on Douban, one of the largest social media platforms, is now also very popular, 2.5 million hits and more than a thousand tips. Of course, families who specify their children's performances are not only in China, but the competitive thinking and shameless border crossing can be more overwhelming than in Europe: as the strangers on the train also ask older relatives during the Spring Festival after the income of the Younger, after dates and marriage intentions, according to the details of birthplanes, education plans for the babies - again there is unquestioned advice for free. It is by no means unusual that your weight, the length of your legs and your neck, your diet will be commented on your skin. Of course everything from pure care. When the boasting (and be it only to the outside) proud parents started first, spill on the game on the table. The son has been promoted, the other has a big baby; One daughter has given her parents a luxurious apartment, the other has taken the parents to a European trip ... then the time has come to hand over the blessing wishes in the form of money in red envelopes (\u7ea2\u5305 or Hongbao) to the children and the seniors. This is the final, brutal use: prosperity. Hongbao \nIn recent years, competition has changed a lot thanks to the Internet Operium Tencent. For Spring Festival 2014, Tencent has launched a new in-app service called Wechat Hongbao in its social media app WeChat. Since anywhere is paid digitally digital, that was immediately a success: 823 million participants have used the service at the Spring Festival 2019. For members of a group chatting, Hongbao even offers the opportunity to compete for the same Hongbao. Wechat has changed an old Chinese custom in the consequence of three views. On the one hand, the habit in the past dictated only that one distributed funds to family members; But now one is obliged to consider friends and colleagues. Second, today many internet companies also give digital Hongbao to their users for customer loyalty. The short video platform Kuaishou will transfer Hongbaos in the amount of a billion yuan (just under 130 million euros) this year. And third, the geographical distance is no more reason to give up to the hand over the red envelopes, that goes from anywhere in the world, no matter where you live, and be it on the island of Palau. During the festive weeks, many Chinese stares on their cell phones to catch a portion of luck. Soon new apps that should help greedy automatically get to the digital envelopes of companies. I have not won a competition so far because I was too far away in recent years: whenever I discovered the envelopes on the screen, she had already emptied someone in China. With these false promises, it behaves like with distant stars in the sky: what I see is just the memory of the past. And yet I have to distribute my Hongbaos online. Luckily, Wechat has a ceiling for the sum of each red envelope set in a chat group: 200 yuan, about 26 euros. but not only \nEmigrants see the bustle during the Spring Festival from afar.\u70ed\u95f9, the assembly of a large, exuberant crowd, is the core of secular luck in Chinese society, but more and more people have enough of it. Some rich, but some middle-class families today make overseas vacations to escape the noise, traffic and air pollution of China, which, for example, bring the many fireworks with them during the Spring Festival. The countries of Southeast Asia and Japan are the favorite destinations that really rich and world-centers prefer even further corners of the planet. But wherever you flee, most of them stay connected on boost to post photos and videos and chat with friends and relatives. This is a somewhat different spring festival competition. The farther away from home you are, the better. On the other hand, I'll stay where I am, and that too is quite a performance. I started a traditional spring festival at some point to boycotten, namely the New Year's Gala of China Central TV. This television show was launched in 1983 by the government transmitter, which has long since become an indispensable element of family celebration. I grew up with it and gradually lost the taste as my political thinking and my ethical standards changed. I've learned from the stories behind the stage: from the famous director, who came to prison because of the acceptance of bribes; One after the other, the beautiful singers to lover political leaders; Popular Comedians were thrown out of the show and were also allowed to occur in any show in any way because they insisted on the preservation of their copyrights ... Ugly power games are inevitable in a broadcast, which aims at the New Year's Day the souls of 1.4 billion people \nto seduce and form. There were occasional calls in this year after canceling the show due to the outbreak of the new coronavirus. She then went without much mention of the sick and dying over the stage. In the network, the sharply was commented as \"Discount on the Graves\". Many younger people reported in the social media from their disgust before the Healing World Show. An overall even small but growing lot of young people just in the big cities, the Gala no longer relies on, her embarrassing aesthetics, the forced cheerfulness, the demonstrative display of love for army and party, the gender stereotypes, celebrating the traditional family . Not the slightest a bit of negativity or criticism is allowed, love and luck are mandatory: look at the magnificent overall picture of the nation and forget every pain. And the parents always have law and are full of caring, as well as the party and their army. Everything looks a bit different in villages and small towns. The younger ones among the returning migrant workers and workers have an additional obligation during the Spring Festival: they are sent to blind dates that have prepared the families and professional marriage brokers for them. You have to find a husband or wife in these ten days, because they usually have no vacation in the rest of the year. Blind Dates Arranged by the family have been the norm in China over centuries. Only with the founding of the People's Republic, this tradition died slowly. In the country, however, the marriage promotion as a prosperous industry in the past decade is risen, in response to the bitter reality of migrant worker life. Also in this regard, 2020 is an exceptional year: the access roads to many small towns and villages are blocked to prevent the contagion with the coronavirus. Thus, the marriage will also fall out this year. \nThe blind date industry also flourishes in the country because the relationship of female births to male in China has a clear imbalance in favor of the boys. China ranks in the current global gender gap index in place 106 of 153 states: the abortion female fetuses or even the killing of female newborn is so widespread in some areas so far that young men barely find partners. The professional marriage enrollment became such a thing of the need, only the commercial institutes have the time to look for the few girls. Many reports describe the very direct selection procedures with which these dates are arranged. On a hectic day, a young woman can ever be merged with more than a dozen men. Then, with the applicants, the information on cars, houses, income, height, appearance, appearance, character, character must be obtained, under the strict view of parents and other relatives. It sounds like a laughing shopping experience: moatshopping. However, given the low status of a wife in the village and the lack of institutional protection from domestic violence, marriage to women is a risky and with many duties of burden. The sobbing girls take a man with older sisters, because these are usually obliged to support the younger brother financially. Very brave young women refuse to marry, others go to the city and work hard for their financial independence. But during the Spring Fest, even these rebellious women travel back to the parents and bring them money and gifts. From the third day of the Moon New Year, people sweep back to their jobs. Once again the hectic efforts to get the bus, train or flight, but now in the state of the meals court. Some are sad, most of them relieved. I always have to \nThis latter majority belongs. Finally, most of us have been pulled into the larger cities with a good reason for study and job. Freedom and independence are seductive. I have read many old poems about the Spring Festival, of poets who left their hometimes. Most describe grief and homesickness. Traditional Chinese have always seen leaving home as the greatest tragedy in life. Obviously, China has changed, all apparent nostalgia for a glorious but petrified past. There are more and more, which identify with the modern spirit of the poet Meng Haoran from the Tang Dynasty: \"I drive through the world and have my pleasure wherever I am, do not take care of the old years passed by\" (\u5ba2\u884c \u968f\u5904\u4e50, \u4e0d\u89c1 \u5ea6\u5e74 \u5e74). In times of the threat of the disease, it is even over with this pleasure. There is only a sense of helplessness and anger on a government that does not protect its citizens, but deliberately demonstrated.

in the next six months because of the high demand brought on by the coronavirus outbreak. over the past seven weeks, the virus \u2014 named covid-19 \u2014 has spread to 25 countries. as the outbreak grows and new cases mount into the tens of thousands, global attention turned to china and, along with it, resources. the mask most effective at protecting chinese healthcare workers from contracting the virus, however, is also the only mask used to protect healthcare workers in south africa from tb. but a spike in global demand for the product is outstripping manufacturers' ability to produce the masks here and abroad. currently, the world health organisation says there is a six-month backlog in mask orders globally. already behind in production, manufacturers are unlikely to be able to catch up as long as the outbreak rages and future orders of the masks could be delayed or only partially filled. either way, countries like south africa that need the masks for tb are unlikely to get what they need when they need it. tb remains the leading cause of death in south africa, according to 2016 data from statistics south africa. in particular, healthcare workers are at an exceptionally high risk of getting infected. in south africa, the masks are procured nationally and also provincially. national health department spokesperson popo maja confirms the department is experiencing delays on shipments of respirator masks. he attributes delays to major mask-producing countries such as india and china banning exports of the protective gear to secure their own national supplies. south africa's few local producers of the speciality masks, he warns, cannot immediately supply increased numbers of the masks. the national department was unable to confirm whether or not any provinces were experiencing shortages. south \nafrica, along with egypt and algeria, is estimated to be at highest risk for new coronavirus cases on the continent, according to a study published in the lancet. no cases have been confirmed in south africa yet. supply and demand: local producers unlikely to keep up in the eastern cape, multinational firm 3m held the previous provincial tender to supply the respirator masks. a current tender released in november 2019 has not yet been awarded. 3m, alongside every other company in the world that makes these masks, has seen a skyrocketing demand for the

factory. however, their order requests have soared to one-million, says quinton taylor, product manager for dr\u00e4ger south africa. \"our production facilities are aimed at the southern african market, it\u2019s not aimed anywhere near being able to produce a mask for someone that wants a million masks,\" says taylor. \"everyone is trying to order more material [for the masks]. the guys that manufacture the material are eventually going to run out with the numbers that are coming through. it's inevitable.\" outbreak overseas could endanger the fight against a local killer almost two

elsewhere in coming months. meanwhile, mounting backlogs in orders amid increasing demand and a looming shortage in the materials used in the masks are also likely to jeopardise supply. this could be bad news for south africa\u2019s fight against tb. the respirators masks, which come in two different shapes, are the only masks that are proven to help prevent the transmission of tb. the devices are

The new coronavirus that causes pneumonias and originates in China has already killed 131 people in China and infected more than 5,500 people worldwide, including a nine-month baby, but what is unaware about the virus is still much more than what already You know. By knowing it is still the exact origin of the virus, which is the host (animal) and whether or not there was an intermediate host. It is also not yet clear the form of transmission between humans, the exact period in which this transmission is and the rate of attack of the virus. That is, to know the epidemiology of the new infection - who, how and when? Here are some issues about the virus for which there is still no answer: What is the real rate of attack? Although daily growing the number of infected, it is not yet a truly known to be the range of the virus. What are the most affected people? It is not known whether the virus also affects all kinds of people, from adults or children, sick or healthy, as the Agency has underlined the pneumologist Filipe Froce, named representative of the Order of Physicians for the issues linked to the new Coronavirus (2019-Ncov ). International authorities still do not also know who has the most serious forms of the disease and what characteristics of the dead by this new virus. The pneumologist Filipe Froce recalls that out of China has not yet occurred no serious situation, although all cases of the disease are imported. Does the virus affect children? And what is your expression in pediatric age? There is a report of a case of a nine-month baby infected by one of the parents, but it is not yet known whether the virus has affected children in the same way that affects adults. What is the transmission period? The pneumologist Filipe Froes recalls that the Chinese authorities warned that there may be transmission between people even before the onset of symptoms. It is not known whether it is an exception or a rule and how long before the symptoms \nManifest may the disease be contagious. It is also ignored if, similar to what happened to SARS (English acronym for severe acute respiratory syndrome), if there are patients with greater contagion capacity than others. It is also unknown to the highest transmission period and even when it occurs. What treatments are there? Currently, patients are being treated with support measures, which only treat the symptoms of the disease, such as fever or respiratory difficulty. There is still no specific medicine for this new coronavirus. Filipe Froes indicates that there will be ongoing experimental treatments, but its effectiveness is still unknown. According to the specialist, a vaccine will already be developed, much based on the work that had been made for atypical pneumonia 2002/2003 - SARS. It is still necessary to wait for tests on effectiveness and safety. What is the exact source of the virus? The first cases of the new coronavirus in humans were linked to a fish market and meat in the Chinese city of Wuhan. However, it is not known what the animal that transmitted the virus to the first infected patient, nor if there was an animal that is the originating host and another the intermediate host. What is then known about the new coronavirus? Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses living in other animals (eg birds, bats, small mammals) and that in the human being usually cause respiratory diseases, from a common constipation to more severe cases such as pneumonies. They can transmit between animals and people. Most coronavirus strains circulate between animals and do not even infect human beings. In fact, until now, only six coronavirus strains among existing thousands is that they passed the species barrier and reached people. The new coronavirus is from the same family of the virus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (2002-2003) and the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (2012). These two types of coronavirus \nSo far those who have had the ability to cross the barrier of the species and to convey to humans and who have tables of some gravity, explained to the Agency Lusa the pneumologist Filipe Froce. The first cases of 2019-NCOV appeared in mid-December in the Chinese city of Whuan, when they began to reach the hospitals people with a viral pneumonia. It was noticed that all people worked or frequently visited the seafood market and Huanan meats in the same city. The exact origin of infection is still unknown, but they will have been infected animals, which are marketed live, transmit it to human beings. These viruses usually transmit through the respiratory route and mainly affect the respiratory tract, especially the lungs in the serious forms. The symptoms of these coronavirus are more intense than a flu and include fever, pain, general malaise and respiratory difficulties. In cases initially confirmed, 90% presented fever, 80% dry cough, 20% shortness of air and only about 15% presented difficulty.

people to people.   with increased searching and testing for the novel virus among people with symptoms like fever and coughing, the number of cases in china surged over the weekend. wuhan, the centre

the worst is now over, downplaying warnings that the disease could become seasonal or that a deadlier \"second wave\" could hit later in the year.  \n as the pandemic continues to spread overseas, a growing number of countries are bracing themselves for a worst-case scenario in which covid-19 remains in circulation until next year at the earliest.  \n but medical advisers in china have expressed confidence that the country's strict containment measures have done enough to ensure that the outbreak can be brought under complete control, domestically at least, within weeks.  \n though they remain wary of the risks of \"importing\" cases from overseas, they say china should be capable of eliminating covid-19 in the same way it eliminated severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) in 2003. sars was eventually contained after the government imposed stringent screening and quarantine measures.  \n \"for me, a second outbreak (of coronavirus), a domestic outbreak in china, wouldn't be a great concern,\" said cao wei, deputy director of the department of infectious diseases at the peking union medical college hospital.  \n she told a briefing on monday that while china needed another month to make a final judgment, the existing prevention and control measures should be enough to bring the epidemic to an end domestically.  \n the world health organization has said the coronavirus reached a peak in china around late february. zhong nanshan, a senior government adviser who helped detect and defeat sars in 2003, said it \"could be over by june\" if other countries take the required action.  \n on wednesday, there were no new domestic cases in the disease's epicentre of wuhan for the first time since the outbreak began. however, \"imported\" infections reached a record 34, and have outnumbered domestic transmissions for five consecutive days.  \n ian henderson, director of the institute for molecular bioscience at the university of queensland, said china's actions to contain the virus have been \"extraordinary\" but there could be a second outbreak, this time imported.  \n \"(what) remains possible is that as controls around isolation are relaxed in china, with a population that is still susceptible, then the virus may resurge if it has not been eradicated elsewhere,\" he said.  \n  \n done \"99 out of 100\"  \n gao zhengliang, vice-director of the china cell biology institute told the official youth daily newspaper that the country had now completed \"99 out of 100 steps\" required to defeat the coronavirus, though he warned that if global infections spiralled out of control, \"the costs and sacrifices china has made will be downgraded.\"  \n some experts have referred to the infection patterns of the devastating 1918-19 influenza epidemic that killed more than 50 million people during three different waves, with the second the deadliest. however, henderson said it was important to recognise the current virus was different from influenza.  \n global inter-connectedness means that instead of coming in waves, new viruses are now more likely to spread and circulate until they mutate or until a certain level of immunity is reached. one crucial issue is how long a previously infected patient remains immune.  \n \"the number one point to get across is that in terms of the behaviour of this virus we are still very much in the dark,\" henderson said. \"the issue around protective immunity is difficult to answer because we simply do not have sufficient information.\"  \n some experts have raised the possibility that covid-19 could become an entrenched seasonal illness along with ordinary influenza.  \n preliminary studies have shown a possible correlation between the epidemic and climate patterns. a paper produced by researchers in europe this week said the coronavirus preferred cool and dry conditions which could lead to seasonal global outbreaks \"much like other respiratory diseases\".  \n however, there have still been cases in warmer and more humid climates in southeast asian countries, including thailand and singapore.  \n u.s. president donald trump has been one of many to suggest that covid-19 could go away of its own accord as temperatures rise in the northern hemisphere.  \n however, marc lipsitch, a communicable disease expert at the harvard t.h. chan school of public health, said while warmer and wetter weather could reduce the contagiousness of the coronavirus, \"it is not reasonable to expect those declines alone to slow transmission enough to make a big dent.\"  \n gao of the china cell biology institute said given the higher fatality rate for the coronavirus, relaxing curbs was not an option.  \n \"the resolute curbs on the coronavirus must be continued, it absolutely cannot be allowed to co-exist with humans in the same way as the influenza virus.\" reuters "}, {"content": "update 1-cargill bans international travel for staff amid coronavirus outbreak.

And the coronavirus now teaches the entertainment industry now. Ironically, Hollywood Darling Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson surprised as the first celebrity couple with the message that they both are infected with SARS COV-2. The entertainment company is quasi-lame. Film and TV productions are stopped, cinema starts worldwide canceled, trade fairs and festivals. Industry experts expect cinema club losses of up to $ 20 billion this year, when the standstill goes over several months. The first burglary came in January with the closure of cinemas in China, the country of origin of the novel virus, at the same time the second largest cinema market to USA and Canada. In February then the preliminary for Tom Cruise and \"Mission: Impossible 7\". For three weeks, director Christopher wanted to turn McQuarrie in Italy, where the virus ruled. It goes on strike: At the beginning of March, the start of the new James Bond film \"No Time to the\" will be postponed to November by seven months - \"After careful consideration and more thoroughness \nEvaluation of the global cinema market, \"says sober justification. Because of the Coronavirus had previously been canceled the entire Advertisingour in China. In the last few days, it meets more blockbusters: \"Fast & Furious 9\", \"The New Muttants\", \"Mulan\", \"Peter Hase 2\", \"A Quiet Place 2\". Fans have to be patient longer until these films come to the cinema. John Krasinski, director of the horror movie \"A Quiet Place 2\", commented on the postponement on Instagram. His movie should be experienced together with other people in the cinema. \"Now obviously is not the right time for it.\" According to China, Italy, Poland and Germany, more and more lighting houses are also tight in other countries. In the US, most cinemas are still open for the time being, but they only give off half of the tickets to make more space and thus more distance between visitors. The Hollywoodstudios set the recommendation \"Social Distancing\", so go to a distance to each other to avoid infections radical. The Disney Studio announced a massive turntop on Friday, encounters on the set are avoided. Among other things, large projects such as \"The Little Mermaid\", Guillermo del Toros \"Nightmare Alley\" and Ridley Scott's Historiendrama \"The Last Duel\" with Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. At the end of February, the shooting for \"Jurassic World: Dominion\" had begun in Hawaii, now the set will be closed until further notice, the Universal Studios announced. For \"The Batman\" came on Saturday the forced break. Warner Bros. Will interrupt the Rotation in England on January since January Robert Pattinson for at least two weeks. Also, the Netflix streaming service announced, as a precaution, for at least two weeks the production of films and TV shows in the US and Canada. The positive coronavirus test at Tom Hanks had led to the set in Australia for immediate demolition of the new production of director Baz Luhrmann. Biopic \nFrom the studio Warner Bros. Is a title-free movie bike over the Rock'n'Roll Legend Elvis Presley, in Hanks whose manager Colonel Tom Parker plays. The two-time Oscar award winner and his wife had announced the diagnosis on Thursday in the social media. They are now in quarantine and would \"take every day as he comes,\" Hanks emphasized easily. Industry experts in Hollywood meanwhile give a gloomy forecast. They already count up the possible billions losses through the corona crisis. 20 billion dollars could be missing alone at the kinocasses this year, especially when the lucrative foreign markets break down, the film sheet \"Hollywood Reporter\" reported on Friday. In 2019, more than $ 42 billion finished in Hollywood's cash. The annual trade fair Cinemacon is also canceled, where the film theater industry wanted to introduce the latest Hollywood projects at the end of March in Las Vegas. The renowned film festivals Tribeca in New York and the International Film Festival in San Francisco (both planned for April) have been canceled. These are bad harbinges for Cannes, where the 73nd film festivals are in mid-May (still) on the plan. A cancellation would hit the already ailing international industry.

outbreak caused by a new coronavirus.\u00a0\u00a0   as two old hands who experienced the struggles of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) pandemic in singapore, we are gratified to see that preparedness systems are in place here and working well.\u00a0   the measures introduced have even been endorsed by infectious disease experts such as the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine\u2019s professor david heymann, who noted that despite causing inconveniences, singapore \u201cis not overdoing it\u201d.\u00a0   nonetheless, a crisis of public confidence is moving faster than the crisis of public health.\u00a0   masks, hand sanitisers and disinfectants were the first to fly off the shelves. even in our traditionally stoic society, a breach in our psychological defence occurred when some took to hoarding food and household items once singapore moved to dorscon orange on feb 7.\u00a0\u00a0   can we succeed in beating this virus?\u00a0the answer is most certainly yes, and we are confident of the reasons why.\u00a0   understanding our insecurity\u00a0   insecurity amidst uncertainty is to be expected. many reports, some untrue, are making their rounds in chat groups, stoking public anxiety, doubt and fear.   we are sad to see sars revisited in many ways, with the old unfounded fears of infection prompting members of the public to shun healthcare workers and landlords to throw out tenants who had travelled to china.\u00a0   but covid-19 is much less deadly than sars or the middle east respiratory syndrome (mers). case-fatality rate measures the number of deaths among those infected and this is now coming out consistently to be much lower for covid-19.\u00a0\u00a0   on the other hand, this disease is far more capable of transmitting between humans than sars or mers. transmissibility is measured by its reproduction number\u00a0\u2014\u00a0cases directly generated from each case \u2014 \nand this is showing to be more like pandemic influenza.   while social media can be useful, it also means that information can be overstated. bad news spreads faster than good news. media, which build in algorithms that prioritise sites similar to those often visited, compound biases in line with previous viewpoints and worsen fear.   the authorities have been quick to provide timely updates and dispel rumours.\u00a0\u00a0   but people have different ways to judge the impact for themselves, with some even contemplating the \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d future state, such as dorscon red. hence, expectations and beliefs honed from prior experience and observation of other countries contribute towards behaviours such as panic buying.   the verdict on this outbreak is not out yet. much attention is on the effectiveness of control measures in china.   some assess that disease incidence will decline into the warmer months of summer. others believe covid-19 will last longer, and possibly become endemic in a way similar to influenza.\u00a0\u00a0   whichever the case may be, we can prepare for the worst while hoping for the best.\u00a0   co-author leo yee sin (right) briefing prime minister lee hsien loong during\u00a0his visit to ncid on jan 31, 2020.\u00a0 \u00a0photo: raj nadarajan / today   why we are confident of success\u00a0   whether the outbreak lasts weeks or months, halting this outbreak in its tracks ultimately depends not so much on disease duration as on our collective resilience.\u00a0   sustainability is key to preparing for a long battle. support for each other is crucial to our psychological defence.\u00a0   when we recall events of 2003, the immediate impact of sars was fear.\u00a0but out of this grew one long-lasting positive effect, in the form of a nationwide crash course on the importance of good hygiene practices.\u00a0\u00a0   being a compact city state with a high population density, and dependent on global connectivity for our life blood, we have to accept many hard truths.\u00a0   but we are not helpless. there are many actions we can take \ntogether to safeguard public health and minimise the impact of acute events that endanger us.\u00a0\u00a0   unwelcome as they are, public health emergencies will occur from time to time and they represent opportunities for us to derive valuable information not just about the disease threat, but also about ourselves.\u00a0\u00a0   courageous volunteers are offering their skills and support in the community. scientists are readily sharing knowledge to address the dearth of understanding on how covid-19 originates and spreads.   and we have dedicated healthcare and public health professionals, many with experience from sars.\u00a0   in addition, singapore's unique size also works in our favour. many challenges are much more manageable in scale here than they would be in other countries.\u00a0   we have ample resources, invested heavily during peacetime. we also have the will to learn from our mistakes and stand together.   these assets collectively constitute our urban health security.\u00a0hence, we are confident of success.   community-based response vital\u00a0   new cases are being reported at an alarming rate in many places outside china. as global events unfold, the momentum of this disease is such that we can expect the outbreak (and case-fatality) to get worse before it gets better. nonetheless, we remain optimistic.   just as with sars, here is a chance for us to improve our community-based response with social norms of self-reliance, solidarity and cooperation.   with concerns over rapid local spread, we must wash our hands regularly and if we feel unwell, wear a mask and avoid contact with others. we must also be judicious in the use of limited resources.\u00a0\u00a0   inconvenience is inevitable, but we must be patient.\u00a0the virus does not discriminate, and neither must we.\u00a0   while we stay geared to fight, our spirits are uplifted by human stories of selflessness. we sense a groundswell of people motivated to strengthen our urban health security.   indeed, some of the panic buying ostensibly for one\u2019s own \nand relatives could be arising from pent-up emotions seeking ways to respond. perhaps we can harness this for a greater good.\u00a0   acts of kindness \u2014\u00a0people cooperating to give unused masks and hand sanitisers to others, and to cheer on frontline workers with food and messages of love and care \u2014\u00a0nourish our hearts with a warm glow of togetherness.   the national centre for infectious diseases and saw swee hock school of public health have linked up with various groups to address requests on how to mount community-based responses, and clarify any misinformation on the outbreak.   as the national crisis unfolds on two fronts\u00a0\u2014\u00a0public health and public confidence\u00a0\u2014\u00a0we see an excellent learning moment for all of us.\u00a0   the community is proving vital to team singapore.\u00a0hence, connection and engagement with them in one whole-of-society approach should not be ignored.   once singapore ceases its containment efforts and life gets back to a semblance of normality, we may yet be surprised that it happened sooner than we expected.   \u00a0   about the authors:   associate professor ooi peng lim is senior consultant with the national centre for infectious diseases (ncid) and

i keep fearing the worst every time i feel feverish or sneeze leading to many sleepless nights. if that wasn't enough, when you go to any store to buy medicines for fever, the employees inform the doctors and you are forced to go to hospital for a check-up. earlier, they would check our body temperature every two hours to find out whether i have contracted coronavirus or not; that routine changed to one day a week and now they have stopped that. i believe we are in the safe zone now. rumour mongering regarding coronavirus is very rampant. some say inhaling dust particles could lead to being tested positive, forcing many to shut their windows. however, how long can one stay in an air-conditioned room? we cannot even dry our clothes as we have to keep all our wet clothes inside the room because we now fear coronavirus might enter through air. the chinese government is cracking down on people who are spreading rumours and till date 15,000 people have been arrested. the government is trying its best to control rumours, but they refuse to die. another rumour was that garlic water was a cure for coronavirus. the other was that if one drank whiskey or wine you wouldn't be affected by the virus. this resulted in a rise in sale of whiskey and wine. soon, there was no whiskey and wine was available in wuhan. i had a miscarriage and returned home on january 22. on that very day, the entire city of wuhan was shut down. i am thankful that i came back on january 22 or else i would have been confined to a hospital which would have been worse. the worst day for \nme was when the doctors came to our home to check whether we were infected with coronavirus or not. there were 10 of them, all dressed up like astronauts. i cried and cried because i felt if i am found positive for coronavirus i would die in china and never see my country again. luckily, i was not positive. and rumours spread so fast on the university campus that we were detected with coronavirus which was untrue. the only way to spend our time is the wechat group all the indians staying in wuhan have formed. we have become friends as we are all in the same boat. every day we feel the air india flight will come, but it has not come yet. we have run out of food and we don't have flour. we are only eating rice. there is no bread, butter or jam too. we have stopped eating breakfast and eat lunch at 11 am. in fact, we have stopped enjoying meals and only want to come back to india. my family is worried as they know that the isolation ward has come very close to our home; it is only 20 metres away from our home and it is just a crossing away. our government is trying its best to bring us back. we were told yesterday that we have to keep our belongings packed and ready as the plane could come anytime from india. now we are waiting for that official phone call from the indian embassy that will finally say that the flight has landed, and to come back home.

has raised alarm bells among health officials the world over as number of people infected and the resultant death toll continues to rise. as on january 21, six people have died and close to 291 infected by 2019-ncov, a new strain of coronaviruses that is reported to have infected humans for the first time. though health officials are still tracing the exact source of this outbreak, initial investigations have indicated it started at the huanan seafood wholesale market in wuhan. most of the infected patients in wuhan had either worked or visited this market. it has been shut since january 1. outside china, two cases have been reported in thailand, one each in japan, taiwan and south korea among people returning from wuhan. the philippines too identified its first suspected case of 2019-novel coronavirus on january 21. faced with this new health emergency, scientists in china and elsewhere are brainstorming to find effective measures to identify the virus' source and contain its impact. the world health organisation (who) has convened a meeting of its emergency committee on wednesday to decide whether the outbreak should be declared an international health emergency. usually, these declarations are made for epidemics of severe diseases that threaten to cross borders and require an internationally coordinated response. previous global emergencies have been declared for crises including the ongoing ebola outbreak in congo, the emergence of zika virus in the americas in 2016 and the west africa ebola outbreak in 2014, the associated press reported. several asian countries, including india, have issued health advisories, and many have started screening passengers arriving from china at their airports. on january 17, three major airports in the us-los angeles, new york and san francisco-started \nscreening people arriving from wuhan. the world health organisation (who) too has said the infection may spread to other places, and has issued interim guidelines based on the limited information available about 2019-novel coronavirus. it has however not called for any trade or travel restrictions so far. what is 2019-novel coronavirus? the 2019-ncov is a new strain of cornoviruses and has not been previously seen in humans. cornoviruses form a large family of viruses and the illness they cause can range from common cold to more severe diseases such as the middle east respiratory syndrome (mers-cov) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars-cov). these viruses are zoonotic, which means they are transmitted from animals to humans. while the exact source (i.e. the animal from which it started) of 2019-ncov is yet to be identified, other strains of coronoviruses have previously been seen to be transmitted from civet cats to humans (in the case of sars-cov) and from dromedary camels to humans (in the case of mers-cov). these aren't the only form of coronaviruses. there are many that circulate among animals but have not yet infected humans. the who had earlier said there was no clear evidence of any human-to-human transmission of this virus, but on january 20, chinese health officials confirmed they have identified some cases of human-to-human transmission. what can 2019-ncov do? since this is the first time 2019-ncov is reported to have infected humans, there is limited information on the exact range of illness the virus can cause. its effects can range from cough and fever to kidney failure and even death. the who has listed the following common signs observed in people infected by 2019-ncov: to contain the viral infection, health officials in china have isolated the infected patients who are being treated at various medical institutions in wuhan. where did the outbreak start? on december 8, 2019, a patient in wuhan city reportedly complained of pneumonia-like \nsymptoms and sought medical help at a local hospital. within days, many others reported similar problems, prompting health officials to launch an investigation. on december 31, china informed the who's country office about these pneumonia cases emanating from \"unknown causes\" in wuhan. taking note of the matter and the limited information available, the who issued interim guidelines for all countries. on january 7, chinese authorities said they have identified 2019-ncov as the cause of the pneumonia. however, experts are yet to identify the source of 2019-ncov i.e. the animal from which it transmitted to humans. six days later, on january 12, in a statement the who said national health officials in china have reported 41 confirmed cases related to this new type of pneumonia. of these 41 patients, seven were severely ill. by january 21, the number of cases rose to 217, with 198 in wuhan alone. these apart, two cases have been reported in thailand and one each in japan and south korea. cases outside china two confirmed cases have been reported in thailand, besides one each in japan, taiwan and south korea so far. all of these patients had recently returned from wuhan and are being treated. the philippines too has identified one suspected case of novel coronavirus. the patient in japan, a man, had travelled to wuhan in late december and developed fever on january 3 when he was still in wuhan. who says as per information received from japan, the man didn't visit the huanan seafood wholesale market (to which most cases have been linked) or any other live animal market in wuhan. he has also denied having close contact with any person suffering from pneumonia. he returned to japan on january 6 and tested negative for influenza. when his condition didn't improve, he visited a local hospital on january 10 and a chest x-ray revealed abnormal infiltrates. following this, he was admitted and on january 14, the doctor attending him notified his case to a local public health \nauthority as an unidentified serious infectious illness'. when his samples were collected and tested by the national institute of infectious diseases, very small amount of 2019-ncov rna were identified. in thailand, the first confirmed case of 2019-ncov infection was identified on january 13 (a 61-year-old woman) and the second

experts in the uk have challenged this number and presented a study claiming that the actual number of patients infected can be much more than the official figures. \"it is likely that the wuhan outbreak of a novel coronavirus has caused substantially more cases of moderate or severe respiratory illness than currently reported,\" the study said. speaking to bbc, prof neil frugson, who was part of the study, said he was worried by the fact that three cases had been reported outside china (all comprising people who had been to wuhan). \"for wuhan to have exported three cases to other countries would imply there would have to be many more cases than have been reported,\" prof frugson told the bbc. threat from yearly migration  with the ongoing festivities of the chinese new year, there is a heightened risk of 2019-ncov infection spreading to other regions because in the \ncoming weeks people (especially non-natives of wuhan) will be travelling home for vacations. china's

taken this year due to the novel coronavirus outbreak in wuhan. \"transport hubs will strengthen disinfection, monitoring and prevention measures, wang yang,\" the chinese ministry of transport's chief engineer, was quoted as saying by the associated press. \"the emergence of the epidemic may cause panic among people, especially in areas where people are concentrated during the spring festival travel period,\" wang said. the who too has said that the annual human migration for these festivities can increase the risk of 2019-ncov cases being reported from elsewhere. with inputs from the

This Wednesday, the World Health Organization announced that a group of experts at China will have concluded that the peak of the epidemic has already occurred, between January 23 and 2 February, considering that the increase in cases stabilized since This time. But there are other scientists, China and Europe, which calculate that the peak of the epidemic will only take place at the end of this month of February (that is, during this week). Other researchers believe that the new coronavirus will still infect millions of people over the next times. Cases increases every day, showing that the virus continues to add victims at the place of origin of the outbreak (in China) and outside Asia.

In the analysis of more than 2500 deaths recorded so far around the world and corresponding to a mortality rate of 2.1%, there are more men (two thirds of the cases), more than 80% of the victims had more than 60 years and 75% had other associated diseases.\nHow many infected people recovered?\nThe vast majority of victims recovered.

"}, {"content": "the dark corona. on january 31, as a special air india flight evacuated 324 indians from wuhan, monika sethuraman, 31, broke down in tears realising that she wouldn't be on the plane. \"i couldn't breathe for a few seconds...i am stuck here in the city, and it's now turned into a huge prison,\" she says over the phone from her one-room dormitory. the doctoral scholar in international relations at wuhan's central china normal university had been instrumental in contacting the indian embassy and arranging the evacuation of fellow indians following an outbreak of the new novel corona\u00advirus (2019-ncov). for sethuraman herself, leaving wuhan won't be easy now. \"i didn't go to the airport because i knew i would not be cleared for the flight out. even if i recover from the cold, once you are on the blacklist, you will not be allowed to fly out,\" she laments. since the transport lockdown on january 23, sethuraman has stocked up on essentials. according to her, stepping out is futile. one will be spotted by a drone, the building security cameras or police, and sent back indoors. \"the authorities aren't interested in testing or verifying if you have the virus. they are only interested in control...it doesn't matter if we live or die so as long as the virus is contained,\" she says. \"i am foll\u00adowing who (world health organization) guidelines, but there is no human interface to connect to. if people see you wiping your nose, they run from you, including the officials. that's the kind of panic and desperation here.\" the travails of vinay ahuja, 38, who was visiting business associates in the region when the city went into a lockdown, are no different. \"nobody expected it to escalate so quickly,\" he says, as he marks time before he gets permission to fly out. what ahuja and many others are wondering is whether india would be able to replicate china's iron-fisted attempts to control the outbreak in a similar situation. china has been criticised by human rights groups, but received \npraise from who for its aggressive approach to control 2019-ncov. the country built a 645,000 sq. ft emergency hospital in wuhan in just 10 days. the two-storeyed hospital has 30 intensive care units (icus), 1,000 beds and special corridors to limit patient-nurse contact. a second hospital could be up by february 5. seldom has an illness-largely a little-known respiratory disease-aroused such apprehensions as the 'corona', now part of the popular lexicon as a dreaded threat, eclipsing the pleasant connotations of being the aura around the sun and a branded cold brew. first detected in december 2019, 2019-ncov is a previously unidentified strain. it comes from the same family of viruses as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars-cov), which claimed 774 lives, including three indians in 2002-03. the situation in india is nowhere as grim as at epicentre wuhan, though three cases had been confirmed until february 5, while 3,935 were under observation at isolation wards across the country, apart from the special camps for wuhan returnees near delhi airport. so, how prepared is india to handle the coronavirus in case the numbers spike? considering there is no vaccine or trial-proven drug therapy yet, aff\u00adected patients are being treated symptomatically based on clinical severity. \"serious cases who have viral pneumonia will need supportive intensive care, including mechanical ventilation when required. hospitals in large cities can provide this, if the numbers are not overwhelming. small towns and rural areas in most states will be ill-equipped if the virus spreads further,\" says dr k. srinath reddy, president, public health foundation of india (phfi). the public health system will have to go the extra mile to check the potential spread of the virus. entry points to the country are being closely monitored to assess incoming travellers. there is still the danger of infected persons slipping through in the asymptomatic but infectious phase of the illness. isolation of \nclinically-suspected cases is essential even where a specific virological diagnosis is not immediately available. close contacts of affected persons are being advised clinical assessment and restricted mobility till the incubation period (up to two weeks) is over. \"since the symptoms are not specific to this virus, a high index of suspicion is needed based on history of exposure to a proven/ likely case, even where laboratory facilities for a specific viral diagnosis are not readily available,\" explains reddy. \"we have to educate the public with well-framed risk communication messaging and health advice, and all healthcare providers must follow the correct diagnostic/ clinical protocols.\" a comprehensive nationwide surveillance system is still a work in progress. while this network has expanded since the h1n1 virus threat loomed large a decade ago, competent labs are needed at more locations. in 2012, there was a proposal to set up 150 diagnostic and research labs with virology-related expertise. of these, 80 are operable now, but this number is far from adequate. these are also not linked to the public health response system and only serve as support for ad hoc reporting. though india has an integrated dis\u00adease surveillance programme in each district, this is done at a micro level and largely follows a symptomatic approach. \"we need case-based surveillance-where any suspicious disease outbreaks are reported to labs for real-time con\u00adf\u00adirmation. what we have is reporting at district levels based on extreme symptoms,\" says dr g. arun kumar, head, manipal institute of virology, one of four diagnostic labs under the indian council of medical research (icmr). detailed investigations found that the sars-cov was transmitted from palm civets to humans in china in 2002 and the middle east respiratory syndrome (mers-cov) from dromedary camels to humans in saudi arabia in 2012. the animal source of the 2019-ncov is yet to be identified. it's likely the source is a live animal \nmarket in china. labs and the health system have also largely overlooked animal research and the risk mapping of india. there are several types of animal to human transmitted (zoonotic) diseases. they vary in terms of pathogen diversity (viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, helminths) and animal sources (bats, pigs, chickens, other birds, palm civets, dogs, fishes, crustaceans and snakes). india has fairly well-established programmes for monitoring zoonotic diseases like rabies, brucellosis and japanese encephalitis. it is the threat of newer viruses, transmitted from wild or cap\u00adtive bred animals, that is most worrisome. \"to identify the emergence and spread patterns of zoonotic pathogens, we need a 'one-health' approach, combining research data from wildlife, veterinary and human populations involving biology, epidemiology and clinical studies. surveillance of wet markets, involving sale of animal foods, has to be strengthened. at the same time, research needs to identify entry points of zoonotic pathogens from outbreaks in other countries,\" explains dr reddy. agencies such as the national centre for disease control (ncdc) and the icmr have advanced efforts in these areas. yet, india is unequal to the task, be it handling an emergency or pursuing priority research. the weak links lie in inadequately integ\u00adrated epidemiological surveillance of zoonotic pathogens in forests, close-bred veterinary clusters and human population groups. this is one of the reasons why nipah claimed 17 lives in kerala in 2018. the dearth of virologic and taxonomic studies on native bats made it difficult to understand the nature of the virus. however, the state has learnt from the tragedy. kerala has declared 2019-ncov a state calamity and has kept over 2,000 people under surveillance at their homes. \"this is to tighten vigil rather than create panic. we do not want to miss out on any case,\" says state health minister k.k. shailaja. this level of vigilance has not been replicated \nelsewhere. despite india being in the top 30 countries at risk from the virus, there has been no statement from the minister of health and no central guidelines for detecting and controlling infection. in contrast, european countries began tracking down visitors from china and putting out strong public advisories two weeks after the outbreak. precautionary guidelines for the public in india are yet to be widely disseminated, in english or in local languages. \"there are all kinds of misleading reports giving the public incorrect information to help cure the virus. most people also do not know how to protect themselves, which masks to wear, and so on. public education has been entirely neglected so far,\" says chapal mehra, a public health specialist in delhi. \"we need a proactive approach, not a reactionary one. large-scale screening of risk individuals has to be a priority. it's a challenge for our public health system, which is yet to come out with a strategic approach to the issue,\" he adds. a concerted multi-agency response, led by a competent public health system, is the need of the hour, but it is currently hampered by the limited expertise in the country. in the medium term, agile outbreak response systems have to be built, primary healthcare facilities (where clinical assessments take place) strengthened and vaccine development efforts advanced. if the virus does spread here in the same magnitude as in wuhan, the impact on the economy, healthcare and public morale could be catastrophic. with one of the world's highest population densities, especially in urban cities like delhi and mumbai, maintaining three-feet distance between individuals (as recommended by the who) will be impossible, nor will the lockdown of an entire city be feasible. meanwhile, social media broadcasts by individuals in wuhan paint a grim picture. shortage of food and medicines, panic and misinformation, depression, even theft-the virus doesn't just destroy health, it destroys society. \nit's already visible in kerala. there are media reports of families of china returnees being 'ostracised'.

"}, {"content": "as covid-19 outbreak starts to resemble global pandemic, travel bans will have limited relevance, says lawrence wong. singapore \u2014 the covid-19 outbreak is \u201cstarting to look like a global pandemic everywhere around the world\u201d, at which point it will not be possible to shut singapore out from the world, national development minister lawrence wong said on friday (march 6).   \u201cwhat we might do, even when (the disease) becomes more prevalent around the world, is to maintain some level of surveillance as we are doing today at the checkpoints to pick out and identify people with symptoms.   \u201cthat might still be one level of control that we can do at the borders, but beyond that, we do need to do more within our own community in singapore to slow the spread of the virus,\u201d said mr wong at a press conference by the multi-ministry task force that is tackling the virus outbreak, which he co-chairs.   health minister gan kim yong, who also co-chairs the taskforce; environment and water resources minister masagos zulkifli; and moh director of medical services kenneth mak were also present at the conference held at the national press centre.   mr wong was addressing a question about the continued relevance of border controls and travel restrictions, following fresh measures issued on tuesday to bar the entry of foreign visitors with recent travel history to iran, northern italy and south korea, which have been identified as epidemic centres for the disease outside china.   \u201cyou have got to look at two categories: (the first) are the countries that we have already put in place travel restrictions, because we have identified these to be epidemic centres, starting with china and later expanded to a few other countries. to the extent that these countries take effective containment measures... then at some point in time, i think border controls to these countries will no longer be so relevant,\u201d he said, referring to china and south korea.   mr wong said china has been working hard to \ncontain the virus and the number of new cases have gone down, while south korea is taking proactive testing measures and is also vigilant in containing the spread to other cities.   when deciding on whether to lift travel restrictions on these visitors, singapore will consider \u201cif the situation within these countries is clearly very well contained\u201d and look at other data and evidence.   the second part is whether to impose new border control measures, such as travel restrictions, targeting new epidemic centres of covid-19, he said.   \u201ci will not rule it out at this stage, but if you think and project ahead, and indeed if the virus is spreading and not that we have one clear epidemic centre and there are epidemics all around the world and it becomes a global pandemic, then there is no basis for putting together border controls unless we shut ourselves, which we don\u2019t want to,\u201d he said.   whether singapore decides to impose these new bans depends on the evolving situation and the usefulness of such restrictions, added mr wong.   \u201cat that stage, the bigger risk is not importation of cases from these countries, but the importation of cases from countries that may not have travel restrictions\u2026 we are now seeing more cases coming from europe, we are starting to see more cases in america, so it is starting to look like a global pandemic everywhere in the world,\u201d he said.   addressing a question on whether lifting these measures at a time when singapore deems fit to do so would inadvertently cause a surge of visitors from places previously seen as high-risk, mr gan said it was important not to see singapore\u2019s approach to border controls in a \u201cbinary way\u201d, since its actions have been incremental.   this is evident in how singapore has gradually ramped up its restrictions from wuhan - where covid-19 was first reported - to hubei province and then to the rest of mainland china, he said.   mr gan also noted how at the checkpoints, singapore first rolled out temperature \nscreening measures, and later increasing these measures to also conduct swab tests at the borders.   \u201ceven for countries that we have border controls, we may adjust incrementally so it doesn\u2019t mean that if we open the floodgates (by lowering travel restrictions), everybody will come in overnight,\u201d said mr gan.   he urged singaporeans to keep up on personal hygiene efforts, emphasising the critical importance of the new sg clean campaign launched earlier last month.   a new taskforce, headed by the ministry of the environment and water resources, was announced friday (march 6) to encourage good personal hygiene, adjust social norms and raise cleaning standards across the country.   mr gan said besides measures such as border controls, the sg clean campaign is in fact singapore\u2019s first line of defence.   he said: \u201cwhether we have temperature screening or swab tests, it is not a hundred per cent. even if we have restrictions on travel (from certain countries), we will also have singaporeans coming back and we can\u2019t stop them from returning to singapore.   \u201ctherefore, personal hygiene and public health standards are the most important (moves) and that is why we need to push ahead with sg clean,\u201d he said.   global pandemic an \u2018emotive\u2019 term   the world health organization (who), although avoiding any reference to covid-19 as a pandemic so far, has nevertheless called upon the world to be prepared for one.   it currently refers to covid-19 as a public health emergency of international concern. a pandemic, according to who definitions, refers to \u201cthe worldwide spread of a new disease\u201d.   in a separate interview following the press conference, moh\u2019s associate professor mak was asked if singapore would be making representations to the who on calling covid-19 a pandemic.   dr mak said the use of the term carries highly emotive overtones, as well as the notion that countries or continents have failed to control the spread of infections within their borders.   \u201cas the who has \nsaid, there is significant potential for a pandemic to arise, but we may not have reached a stage where individual countries and their local efforts to contain it have failed,\u201d said dr mak. he added that it is perhaps more helpful to look at how individual countries are stepping up efforts to control the spread of the virus, and how viruses transmits from one country to another.   on its part, singapore is collaborating and sharing best practices to tackle covid-19 with other countries, he said. there is also the possibility to coordinate national strategies across borders on how to respond to the virus\u00a0\u2014 the health ministries of malaysia and singapore have formed a joint working committee to fight covid-19, for example.   \u201cthese are areas that we continue to look at seriously and we continue to be in discussion with international health authorities, our sister (agencies) in the region and further out, to see how we can share information and align our measures,\u201d he said.

The Bundeswehr has placed more than 100 Germans after their return from the Chinese city of Wuhan in a barrack in the southern Germersheim. They had landed on Saturday night with a Bundeswehr machine in Frankfurt am Main and brought with several buses to the training location of the Air Force, which now serves as a quarantine station. There, the returnees should remain at least two weeks under medical supervision. So you want to ensure that the Coronavirus broken out about one month ago in China does not continue. In addition to the Germans were also 22 Chinese, an American and a romanian aboard the machine. Eleven the total of 124 passengers had been brought after a study at the airport to the Frankfurt University Clinic - among them a patient in which doctors can not exclude a coronavirus disease. In the remaining ten other medical reasons, Hesse's social minister Kai Klose said. The authorities stressed, the risk to the population was low. At the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities of the World Health Organization WHO reported an accumulation of pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause in the Central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the diseases. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days then a group released a group of the virologen Christian's premier from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 the first diagnostic test for the new virus, the researcher provisionally call 2019-NCOV. With the test, the virus can be detected in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, on which, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected. Both the respiratory diseases SARS \n(Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Mers (MIDDLE East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses that have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more than 750 died. With the MERS virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronaviruses. Many of them relate to respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example. In China, several thousand persons are suffering from them, some of them - most of them with pre-existing conditions - have died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first infection cases outside of China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been in Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection with a tourist, who came back from Wuhan, on January 24, the first cases were known in France. Meanwhile, first cases were confirmed in Germany. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. The virus can cause pneumonia that can endally end. Since it is a viral illness, antibiotics do not help. Meanwhile, it is clear that the virus can be transferred from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transfers after a dozen cases were known in medical staff. Medizors assume that the virus is transmitted above all over droplet infection. The World Health Organization calculates, as announced on January 24, at the moment that an infected one cuts 1.4 to 2.5 other people. Contest these numbers, the virus is less contagious than SARS and also the viral flu. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: \nOne should often wash the hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals. That can not be said yet. The World Health Organization said on 28 January that about one-fifth of the reported cases through the virus will be seriously ill, so in case of doubt must be treated intensive care. According to reports, the first death pots were patients who had some severe pre-existing conditions. Even with other infectious diseases, people with pre-existing diseases are particularly endangered - for example at the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so change their genome. This can cause you to become more dangerous for people in the course of an outbreak - but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) expects no similar mortality to the current time as the outbreak of SARS. So far, nine Germans have infected with the novel virus. In Bavaria, the Ministry of Health reported an eighth illness on Saturday, while Spain announced, a German tourist has become infected with the Coronavirus. The coronavirus has an incubation time of up to two weeks in which no symptoms occur. Nevertheless, an infection may be available. The return flight of the Germans from Wuhan dissolved diplomatic tensions with Russia. The Bundeswehrmaschine had originally to be intermediate in Moscow. For this, Russian aviation authorities had also placed a landing permit. In the end, however, Russia denied the intermediate landing and this is due to the fact that the airport has capacity bottlenecks, said Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer (CDU). The minister announced a possible epility. In Russia, the first coronavirus cases had occurred on Friday. How many other countries Russia has therefore exacerbated the entry demands for Chinese. for \nTour groups from China, who have been able to travel to the country without a visa since 2000, immediately applied the visa obligation, shared the government in Moscow. In addition, China will not exhibit any work visas for Chinese for the time being. The measures served the \"safety of the country and the protection of public health\". In addition, this should prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. It is \"temporary\" restrictions, emphasized the government. The People's Republic is the most important trading partner of Russia. In China, the epidemic continues to spread. The country experienced the highest rise in infections and deaths within a day on Saturday. The health commission in Beijing reported an increase of almost 2,000 new diseases and 45 dead. According to the authority, a total of 304 people in the People's Republic died at the respiratory disease. More than 13,700 people have infected themselves throughout China. The 45 new dead come from the particularly strongly affected province Hubei. From Wuhan, the virus has spread in 24 other countries. As the World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Sunday, in the Philippine capital Manila died for the first time an infected outside of China. It is a Chinese from Wuhan. Given the emergency situation, the European Union has sent twelve tons protective clothing to China. As the EU Commission announced, the People's Republic had asked for the aids. The EU Emergency Coordination Center has contacted EU countries. These had collected the twelve tons protective clothing.

The news of the appearance of a new virus in a fish and seafood market in Wuhan, a city in the center of China, caused an international alarm. There are still fresh memories about SARS and MERS, two other coronaviruses. Both emerged already in the present century, provoked a large number of deaths before finally being controlled. The new virus, which for now has no name but causes family symptoms such as fever and breathing difficulties and has led to dozens of pneumonias, does not seem to have the same potential to kill. Of the infected persons already confirmed, one died and was someone who was already seriously weakened by other diseases. In more than 700 people who have had contact with patients, including health professionals, none seems to have been contaminated. However, the possibility of limited transmission within families is not discarded and this week the World Health Organization has warned hospitals from all over the world that the new virus can spread - a fear enhanced by the enormous displacement of people who will accompany the Chinese New Year Celebrations until January 25. In Portugal, the Directorate-General for Health mentioned this Wednesday that there are no reasons for alarm. The Expresso spoke with Raquel Guiomar, who recommends: \"Whenever someone addresses a hospital or a medical office and has a respiratory infection, he should refer to a recent journey, namely China, where the cases of this virus were identified.\"\nWhat measures are being taken by the Ricardo Jorge Institute to face the potential threat of this virus? At the level of laboratory diagnosis, which is the mission of this institute, we are following all the indications given by international networks, in particular by the World Health Organization, and we are establishing specific laboratory diagnosis for this coronavirus. The recommended diagnosis by WHO has been released Tuesday and we are implementing it to quickly become available. In addition to the diagnosis, we are following other WHO guidelines. In all suspected cases, and having a connection with the origin of the outbreak, China, these patients and their products will be tested for the most common viral agents that are associated with respiratory infections - and which the Institute has a vast number of Diagnoses, namely influenza, other human coronaviruses, adenovirus for influenza, and also coronaviruses that were associated with outbreaks in the early two years and now more recently, especially Mers and SARS Coronavirus. In all these suspicious cases it is also recommended to do a search for bacterial respiratory agents and even other agents such as opportunistic fungi. It will be this, therefore, follow-up. The Institute has also implemented a methodology that allows the genome or bacteria either from viruses and fungi in biological samples and will allow it to identify this new virus.\nWhat symptoms can, lead a person to draw attention as an eventual bearer of the new virus? What has been recommended, not only to clinicians, but also to the patients, is that whenever someone addresses a hospital or a medical office and has a respiratory infection, should refer to a recent journey, namely to China, where the cases of this virus were identified. And, as was done in the suspected cases of Mers Coronavirus, it must be ensured that until the confirmation of the laboratory diagnosis - as a negative or positive case - the patient is in insulation conditions. This evaluation is done by the Directorate-General for Health and by the doctors who have this function. The first information gave news that it had not yet been confirmed that the virus could be transmitted among humans. However, there was the case of that person who did not go through the market in Wuhan, where the outbreak will have begun, and yet he contracted the virus. How human can human transmission exist?

returning to the market, the lights might not turn green until we move through the lunar new year travel season to better gauge the coronavirus dispersion.\u201dthe 2003 outbreak of sars in china,

mortality rate of under 10 per cent.while the ordinary flu kills hundreds of thousands of \npeople each year, such new diseases raise alarm due to the uncertainties over how deadly they might be and

pact between beijing and washington had raised hopes that some pressure from tensions between the two biggest economies might ease, and the latest data have showed signs of improved demand for

virus), we expect increased downward pressure on china\u2019s growth, particularly in the services sector,\u201d ting lu and other analysts at nomura in hong kong said in a commentary.the growing

'china's lap dog' dr ghebreyesus has been accused of conspiring with china in its \"propaganda\" to hush-up coronavirus cases. many have gone on to call him \"china's lap dog\", say he is \"irresponsible and coward\", and accuse him of \"jeopardising the world for his private profit\", among other charges. the who chief's recent meeting with chinese president xi jinping and his tweets praising the country's leadership for its \"determination to end the new coronavirus outbreak\" too have not gone down well with many \nsocial media users. the petition blames dr ghebreyesus for the rising coronavirus cases and resultant deaths, and says this is partly because of his underestimation of the outbreak. \"we strongly think he is not fit for his role as who director general. we call for the immediate resignation of dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus. a lot of us are really disappointed. we believe who is supposed to be politically neutral,\" the petition reads. its comment section, where people mention why they are signing the petition, is filled with derogatory remarks that are unmentionable. in short, dr ghebreyesus is being hounded online on two counts: misplaced anger people's concerns and anxiety about the coronavirus outbreak are understandable but that cannot be an excuse to malign the who or its chief. in times of an epidemic of this magnitude, people, irrespective of national boundaries and political leanings, need to stand united and support individuals and organisations that are working on ground to tackle the crisis. hurling personal attacks on individuals leading such efforts doesn't help improve the situation, but rather often proves to be counterproductive. it infuses negativity in public discourse, which in turn tends to cast aspersions on genuine efforts--a breeding ground for suspicion and misinformation. secondly, one may have a hundred differences with china and what its political system and leadership stands for. but is this really the time to attack and malign the nation? before attacking dr ghebreyesus for meeting president xi jinping and praising his government's efforts against coronavirus, one must realise that besides leading an international health organisation in the midst of an epidemic, dr ghebreyesus also has to negotiate various diplomatic hurdles in forging an international coalition against the epidemic. with regards to coronavirus, this global effort is simply impossible if china is not on board. faced with such a sensitive situation, the who chief cannot \nafford to upset the chinese leadership, even if there are some shortcomings on ground. a confrontational approach against president xi jinping is likely to snowball and prove futile when it comes to controlling the situation. those who are calling dr ghebreyesus names and demanding his resignation must answer if they think china would have allowed a who team comprising international health experts to visit coronavirus-hit regions and investigate the situation had the health body's chief confronted president xi and talked bitter about him. the reality today is that thousands of people are suffering in china. many have died and many more are likely to die in the coming days. priority for the global community right now should be to control the situation, not to embroil itself in mudslinging and waste its energy by pointing fingers in a show of one-upmanship. investigations into who and what went wrong (if at all) can wait. saving lives can't. dr ghebreyesus's success in convincing china to allow a team of international health experts to visit coronavirus-affected regions is nothing short of a major diplomatic success. if at all china deliberately hid facts or underreported the situation, as is alleged, it will be known to the world in due course when these international experts document their observations. why do we have to jump into conclusions without any evidence and tarnish the image of hardworking health workers who have been slogging day in out treating patients? those leading the vitriol online attack against the who and its chief must answer if slander, malice and a hatred-filled anti-china campaign is how these tireless medicos deserve to be treated with for their services. the other reason why the who and dr ghebreyesus are being attacked stems from the argument that dr ghebreyesus didn't declare coronavirus outbreak an international health emergency at an earlier date. those forwarding this argument must understand that decisions to declare an international \nemergency cannot be based on one person's whims and fancies. far from being a one-person show, it involves rigorous assessments and deliberations between various stakeholders, all of which takes time. even before declaring it an international health emergency, the who had been rigorously following up on research and treatment of coronavirus patients in china. however, none of this means china, the who or dr ghebreyesus are above questioning. one must question them by all means, but personal attacks and a campaign aimed at tarnishing individuals and maligning an entire country is definitely not the way to do so.

make public your data! us owe us an explanation,\" tweeted zhao, who is known for his provocative statements on social media. pompeo himself has sought to link china to the global pandemic, repeatedly referring to the \"wuhan virus\" despite advice from health professionals that such geographic labels can be stigmatizing. yang issued a \"stern warning to the us that any scheme to smear china will be doomed to fail\", xinhua said in its summary of the call with pompeo. the key chinese foreign policy leader \"noted that some us politicians have frequently slandered china and its anti-epidemic efforts and stigmatized the country, which has enraged the chinese people\", xinhua said. yang called on the us side to \"correct its wrongful behaviour\". trump is under fire over his handling of the pandemic, and his backers have sought to cast the coronavirus as a disease brought by foreigners. while covid-19 has largely come under control in china, it has killed more than 7,000 people around the world and severely disrupted daily life in western countries. "}, {"content": "why are malaria pills being used against coronavirus?. older malaria drugs are being studied, and in some cases used, to treat or try to prevent infection with the new coronavirus, even though there is no firm evidence to show they are effective.  \n studies are underway in a number of countries, including china, france and the united states, to see whether the pills - chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine - may have a role to play in the rapidly spreading pandemic.  \n u.s. president donald trump has touted the malaria drugs as \"a game changer.\" but the food and drug administration and other health experts said trials must first ensure the medicines are effective and safe for use in this patient population.  \n  \n why are malaria drugs under consideration? there are currently no vaccines or u.s.-approved treatments for the highly contagious covid-19 respiratory illness that has killed more than 18,000 worldwide, so even the most severely ill patients largely receive only supportive care such as breathing assistance.  \n on its website, the centers for disease control and prevention says some u.s. clinicians have reported anecdotal use of hydroxychloroquine at different doses.  \n chloroquine is a synthetic form of quinine, which is found on the bark of the cinchona plant. it has been used for hundreds of years in south america to treat fever.  \n chloroquine was first synthesized in the 1930s. a version called hydroxychloroquine, in use since the 1950s, is considered to be less toxic, according to studies. both drugs can cause serious side effects, including vision loss, heart problems or even death, if used incorrectly.  \n the drugs are used to combat malaria, which is caused by a parasite spread through mosquito bites, because they interrupt its ability to digest a host's blood cells.  \n scientists have detailed biochemical proprieties of chloroquine that indicate it could be used against some viral infections. these include direct antiviral effects, such as blocking steps needed by certain viruses to replicate, and its ability to suppress production and release of proteins involved in inflammatory complications of several viral diseases.  \n in addition to malaria, hydroxychloroquine is also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.  \n  \n what does the data say?  \n data has begun to emerge from some coronavirus trials, but most information so far is preliminary.  \n a french team last week said initial results from a 24-patient trial of hydroxychloroquine showed that 25% of patients given the drug still carried the coronavirus after six days, compared with 90% of patients given a placebo. but the trial is small and results on patient outcomes are still awaited.  \n chinese researchers last month reported trial results showing that chloroquine treatment of covid-19 patients had clinical and virologic benefit versus a comparison group.  \n it has been added as a recommended treatment for the illness in china, where the virus first emerged in december.  \n this week, the journal of zhejiang university reported disappointing results from a 30-patient shanghai study of hydroxychloroquine. it showed the drug worked no better than standard care for patients with covid-19.  \n the university of minnesota has launched a 1,500-person trial to see whether hydroxychloroquine can prevent or reduce the severity of covid-19 in people exposed to the virus - including healthcare workers and family members of infected people.  \n other trials of the malaria drugs are ongoing or set to start in the united kingdom, norway and thailand.  \n new york governor andrew cuomo, whose state is the epicenter of the u.s. outbreak with more than 25,000 cases, on sunday said it had acquired hundreds of thousands of doses of the malaria drugs to use in a clinical trial.  \n  \n is there enough to go around?  \n in the united states, prescriptions for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have already spiked and are in short supply, according to pharmacists.  \n several makers of the generic medicines said they are increasing production of chloroquine pills. teva pharmaceuticals industries ltd <teva.ta>, mylan nv <myl.o> and bayer ag <baygn.de> have donated large quantities of the drugs to health authorities.  \n  \n prescription only!  \n health officials caution that no one should be taking these drugs to treat or prevent coronavirus infection without medical supervision and a prescription.  \n in arizona, a man died and his wife was hospitalized after taking a nonmedical form of chloroquine used to fight parasites in aquariums. \"given the uncertainty around covid-19, we understand that people are trying to find new ways to prevent or treat this virus, but self-medicating is not the way to do so,\u201d said dr. daniel brooks, medical director of the poison and drug information center at arizona-based banner health.

against chinese anger over the use of the term, the president used it within seconds of the start of the daily press conference of his covid-19 task force, saying: \u201cthere\u2019s some important developments in our war against the chinese virus\u201d.   \u201cno, no, it\u2019s not racist at all \u2026 it comes from china,\u201d mr trump said when asked why he was using the term amid rising

by american soldiers. that can\u2019t happen. it\u2019s not going to happen, not as long as i am president. it comes from china,\u201d mr trump said.   \u201cnot think; i know,\u201d he said when asked again whether it was definitive that the virus originated from china.   last thursday, beijing\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman, zhao lijian, wrote on twitter that the virus may have originated from the us army, which took part in military world games in wuhan last october. in response, the us summoned china\u2019s washington ambassador cui tiankai this week to complain about the tweet.   in posts on the social media platform, which is banned in china, zhao also shared articles from the canadian conspiracy site global research that suggested covid-19 had originated in the us.   at

a private conversation. \u201cno, not at all,\u201d he said when asked if the term put asian-americans at risk. \u201cthey probably would agree with it 100 per cent, it \ncomes from china.\u201d   mr

reason to do that. they haven't even spoken to me about that,\u201d the president said.   the press conference \u2013 the third consecutive daily briefing fronted by mr trump \u2014 saw a continuation of his dramatic shift of tone regarding the virus, after weeks of downplaying its severity. \u201cwe're going to defeat the invisible enemy, i think we're going to do it even faster than we

soured this week, with both sides trading barbs \u2014\u00a0and conspiracy theories \u2014\u00a0over who was ultimately responsible for the spread of the coronavirus.   china has reacted with fury at trump\u2019s and his republican allies\u2019 insistence on calling the ailment the \u201cchinese coronavirus\u201d or the \u201cwuhan virus\u201d.   those names ignore the world health organisation\u2019s (who) repeated calls for all countries to use the officially assigned terminology \u2014\u00a0covid-19 for the disease, and sars-cov-2 for the virus that causes the illness.   while epidemics\u2019 names in the past had been based on where most of the infections occurred, the who in 2015 issued new guidelines to avoid contagions being identified by geography; the middle east respiratory syndrome was one such example.   the congressional asian pacific american caucus in a statement on tuesday said referring to covid-19 as the \u201cchinese virus\u201d was akin to \u201ctelling people who to blame, they are telling people who to fear and who to hate\u201d.   \u201cunfortunately, we have already seen how this bigotry has impacted asian-americans across the country who are facing increased prejudice and violence,\u201d the group said, adding that many from the community had been assaulted to the point of requiring \nmedical care in hospitals.   \u201cthis is the consequence of spreading xenophobia, something that cannot continue to be amplified by the trump administration and republican members. not now, not ever.\u201d   china, too, has fanned diplomatic flames. in recent weeks, with the outbreak easing across the mainland, senior diplomatic officials have parroted the theory that the virus did not originate in the central chinese city of wuhan, as has been widely presumed by scientists.   beijing also provoked anger in washington on tuesday when it moved to expel at least 13 american journalists from china by revoking their visas in retaliation for washington\u2019s move last month to curb the number of journalist visas it issued to staff from five chinese state-owned media outlets.   the chinese action affects

new coronavirus might have infected at least 500,000 people in wuhan, the chinese city at the epicentre of the global outbreak, by the time it peaks in coming weeks.   the typically bustling megacity, where the so-called 2019-ncov virus emerged late last year, has been in effective lockdown since jan 23, restricting the movement of 11 million people. recent trends in reported cases in wuhan broadly support the preliminary mathematical modelling the london school of hygiene & tropical medicine is using to predict the epidemic's transmission dynamics.   \"assuming current trends continue, we're still projecting a mid-to-late-february peak\" of virus cases in wuhan, adam kucharski, an associate professor of infectious disease epidemiology, said by email sunday (feb 9). \"there's a lot of uncertainty, so i'm cautious about picking out a single value for the peak, but it's possible based on current data we might see a peak prevalence over 5 per cent.\"   that would potentially mean at least 1 in 20 people would have been infected in the city by the time the epidemic peaks, kucharski said, adding that this may change if transmission patterns slow in coming days. the prediction doesn't indicate a coming surge in cases in wuhan, but that the current cumulative total doesn't reflect all infections, especially mild ones, that have occurred.   health authorities in china and around the world are anxiously waiting to know whether the world's largest known quarantine effort has been effective in containing the pneumonia-causing virus in wuhan and across other cities in hubei province, a landlocked region of 60 million people.   kucharski, whose research focuses on the dynamics of infectious diseases, and colleagues have based their modelling on a range of assumptions about the 2019-ncov virus. these include an incubation period of 5.2 days, a delay from the onset of symptoms to \nconfirmation of infection of 6.1 days, and about 10 million people being at risk of infection in wuhan.   based on that, a prevalence of 5 per cent equates to about 500,000 cumulative infections. that's many times more than the 16,902 cases provincial health authorities had counted in wuhan as of midnight sunday.   researchers will gauge the proportion of people in the population who have been infected with 2019-ncov after a test becomes available that enables them to conduct a so-called serosurvey to identify those whose blood contains antibodies produced in response to exposure to the virus.   currently, the true number of people in wuhan exposed to the virus \"may be vastly underestimated,\" manuel battegay and colleagues at the university of basel in switzerland said in a study published friday. \"with a focus on thousands of serious cases, mild or asymptomatic courses that possibly account for the bulk of the 2019-ncov infections might remain largely unrecognised, in particular during the influenza season.\"   authorities in china have counted more than 37,000 cases - of which more than 800 have been fatal - over the past two months. that has surpassed the 774 fatalities from the 2002-2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or sars, over eight months, according to the world health organisation.   in the first 17,000 or so cases, about 82 per cent are mild, 15 per cent severe and 3 per cent critical, the who said friday. of 138 patients admitted to zhongnan hospital of wuhan university in the first four weeks of january, 26 per cent were placed in intensive care and 4.3 per cent died, a study in the journal of the american medical association published friday found.   while the fast-moving, infectious coronavirus has caused thousands of people to fall gravely ill and overwhelm hospitals, once researchers understand the full spectrum of illness associated with the virus, the overall case-fatality risk is likely to be much less than 1 per cent, said ian \nlipkin, director of the centre for infection and immunity at columbia university's mailman school of public health in new york.   people with mild or no apparent symptoms aren't currently being counted among cases, he told reporters sunday. a slowdown in the increase in reported cases over the past few days is \"meaningful,\" according to lipkin, who recently returned to the u.s. from china, where he was advising on the outbreak. he spoke with journalists during a 14-day home quarantine.   if measures taken so far to contain the outbreak are effective, some \"dramatic reductions\" in infections should be observed in the third or fourth weeks of february, he said. warmer, early-spring weather might also impede transmission, he said.   some studies indicate an infected person may not display symptoms for 14 days or more, with testing and confirmation of cases adding to delays. this will prolong the time it will take to identify whether china's unprecedented disease-control measures have worked.   \"the next two weeks are really critical to understand what's been happening,\" said benjamin cowling, head of epidemiology and biostatistics at the university of hong kong, in an interview in melbourne on thursday. \"and, is this going to spread into other locations, or have we avoided what could be a global pandemic because of the control measures that have been implemented to date?\" the number of cases reported in wuhan and across hubei province has been tracking downward over the past several days.   \"there has been a stabilisation in the number of cases reported from hubei, and we're in a four-day stable period where the number of reported cases hasn't advanced,\" mike ryan, executive director of the who's health emergencies programme, told reporters in geneva saturday. \"that's good news and may reflect the impact of the control measures that have been put in place.\" there has been a \"low, but steady incidence\" of infections in places outside hubei, ryan said. it's unclear which \nof those provinces may control the disease or where it might escalate, he said.   \"we hope that the same stabilisation that appears to be occurring in wuhan also occurs outside,\" ryan said. \"but, again it's very, very, very early to make any predictions about numbers.\" \"this is still a very intense disease outbreak in wuhan and hubei, and there are still great risks in practically all of the other provinces, so we will wait and see,\" he said.

australia said they had developed a lab-grown version of the coronavirus, the first to be recreated outside of china. the researchers at the peter doherty institute for infection and immunity in melbourne said they would share the sample, grown from an infected patient, with the world health organization and laboratories around the world. \u201chaving the real virus means we now have the

"}, {"content": "coronavirus pandemic: how south korea trounced us in race to test people for covid-19. in late january, south korean health officials summoned representatives from more than 20 medical companies from their lunar new year celebrations to a conference room tucked inside seoul's busy train station. one of the country's top infectious disease officials delivered an urgent message: south korea needed an effective test immediately to detect the novel coronavirus, then running rampant in china. he promised the companies swift regulatory approval. though there were only four known cases in south korea at that point, \"we were very nervous. we believed that it could develop into a pandemic,\" one attendee, lee sang-won, an infectious diseases expert at the korea centre for disease control and prevention, told reuters. \"we acted like an army,\" he said. a week after the january 27 meeting, south korea's cdc approved one company's diagnostic test. another company soon followed. by the end of february, south korea was making headlines around the world for its drive-through screening centres and ability to test thousands of people daily. south korea's swift action stands in stark contrast to what has transpired in the united states. seven weeks after the train station meeting, the koreans have tested well over 290,000 people and identified over 8,000 infections. new cases are falling off: ninety-three were reported wednesday, down from a daily peak of 909 two weeks earlier. the united states, whose first case was detected the same day as south korea's, is not even close to meeting demand for testing. about 60,000 tests have been run by public and private labs in a country of 330 million, federal officials said tuesday. as a result, us officials don't fully grasp how many americans have been infected and where they are concentrated - crucial to containment efforts. while more than 7,000 us cases had been identified as of wednesday, as many as 96 million people could be infected in \ncoming months, and 480,000 could die, according to a projection prepared for the american hospital association by dr james lawler, an infectious disease expert at the university of nebraska medical centre. the delayed and chaotic testing in the united states will cost lives, potentially including those of doctors and nurses, many medical experts predict. already more than 100 people have died overall, and fears of rampant spread have led to extraordinary restrictions on social interaction, upending the us economy, schools, hospitals and everyday life. \"it makes me feel like i'm living in a farce,\" said dr ritu thamman, a cardiologist and clinical assistant professor at the university of pittsburgh school of medicine. even hospital staff who may have been exposed can't get a test, she said. \"we are a rich country but we don't have these kinds of things?\" the administration of president donald trump was tripped up by government rules and conventions, former officials and public health experts say. instead of drafting the private sector early on to develop tests, as south korea did, us health officials relied, as is customary, on test kits prepared by the us centres for disease control and prevention, some of which proved faulty. then, sticking to its time-consuming vetting procedures, the us food and drug administration didn't approve tests other than the cdc's until february 29, more than five weeks after discussions with outside labs had begun. meanwhile, in the absence of enough kits, the cdc insisted for weeks on narrow criteria for testing, recommending it only when a person had recently been to china or other hot spots or had contact with someone known to be infected. as a result, the federal government failed to screen an untold number of americans and missed opportunities to contain the spread, clinicians and public health experts say. south korea took a risk, releasing briskly vetted tests, then circling back later to spot check their effectiveness. by \ncontrast, the united states' fda said it wanted to ensure, upfront, that the tests were accurate before they went out to millions of americans. \"there are always opportunities to learn from situations like this one,\" fda commissioner stephen hahn, who has been on the job only three months, told reuters. \"but one thing i will stand firm on: we cannot compromise on the quality of the tests because what would be worse than no tests at all is wildly inaccurate test results.\" in a statement, cdc spokesman benjamin haynes said, \"this process has not gone as smoothly as we would have liked.\" but he said \"more and more state labs have come online, increasing our public health system's ability to detect and respond to cases.\" bombarded by criticism amid a re-election campaign, trump vowed on friday to ramp up production of test kits in partnership with private companies and to make the diagnostic tests more widely available at hospitals and in-store parking lots. this week, the fda said more than 35 universities, hospitals and lab companies had begun running their own tests, under the agency's revised policy. but it may be weeks before enough tests are on hand to fill the need. \"the idea of anybody getting (tested) easily the way people in other countries are doing it, we're not set up for that,\" anthony fauci, director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases told a house committee last week. \"that is a failing. let's admit it.\" it's a problem many americans, accustomed to hearing they have the most advanced medical care in the world, find hard to fathom. \"i don't know how we messed this up so badly,\" said ruth blodgett, 65, whose husband of the same age couldn't get a coronavirus test on saturday in an urgent care clinic outside rochester, new york, even though he was coughing and the doctor ordered one for him. \"we got caught flat-footed. for america, that's unacceptable.\" 'hurry up and develop the kits' at the pivotal january 27 meeting at the seoul \ntrain station, south korean government leaders told companies they were cleared for take-off. \"they were told that the 'emergency use authorization' would be coming, so hurry up and develop the kits,\" said lee hyukmin, head of the coronavirus task force at the korean society for laboratory medicine, who was at the meeting. one of the companies was kogene biotech co ltd, whose test kit was the only one to work initially. the government announced its approval on february 4. \"the government acted quickly,\" said myoah baek, an executive director at kogene. the korean cdc \"disclosed information on test methods so test kit makers were able to speed up development.\" lee hyukmin of the korean laboratory society said the government was swift - but not reckless. south korea's rapid response to the new coronavirus resulted from scars of the past. in the aftermath of the 2015 outbreak of mers, short for the middle east respiratory syndrome, critics slammed then-president park geun-hye and her administration for a slow response and a lack of transparency. public confidence waned in park, who was impeached in 2017 following an unrelated corruption scandal. the country had 186 mers cases, more than anywhere outside the middle east, including 38 deaths. \"we can't ever forget the incident. it is engraved in our mind,\" the korean cdc's lee sang-won said. \"we were hurt so much, and we felt remorseful.\" 'a real foul up' on january 31, only days after the seoul train station meeting, the us department of health and human services (hhs) declared the novel coronavirus a public health emergency, citing a similar pronouncement from the world health organization. hhs oversees the separate operations of the fda and cdc, key agencies involved in responding to the pandemic. the cdc was responsible for developing the initial test kits for the virus. then, under longstanding protocols, the fda needed to approve the test before it could be sent to state and local labs around the country. private \nlabs and large hospitals could develop their own tests or work off the cdc version. on february 3, amid the preparations to address the emergency, the fda hosted an all-day conference at its headquarters in silver spring, maryland, which had been scheduled well before the outbreak. regulators, researchers and industry representatives gathered to discuss the general process for putting diagnostic tests cleared under emergencies on the path to permanent approval by the fda. though coronavirus was now the hottest topic in global medicine, a broadcast of the meeting conveyed little sense of urgency about the epidemic sweeping the globe. it was mentioned in passing but regulators mostly stuck to their powerpoint presentations. in his remarks, dr timothy stenzel, who oversees the fda's review of diagnostic tests, spoke broadly about the agency's mission to protect public health: \"it's our goal to be first in the world wherever possible to authorize new tests.\" carolyn hiller, a program director at the medical device innovation consortium, which hosted the event alongside fda, said there were discussions with the agency about postponing the meeting because of the coronavirus outbreak, but both sides opted to go ahead. \"the whole coronavirus thing blew up in real time while this was happening,\" she said. stenzel did not respond to a request for comment. in a statement, the fda acknowledged that the coronavirus was not a \"specific topic on the agenda.\" but it said the agency already was talking to test developers and \"the conference was timely and addressed issues important\" to firms and institutions looking to produce a test. the following day, february 4, the fda greenlighted a cdc test kit for the virus. weeks of chaos would follow. by february 8, some states and other public labs were complaining that the cdc's test wasn't working because of a flawed component that gave inconclusive results. three days later, the cdc told the labs that it was manufacturing a new \ncomponent. as of mid-february, the federal government remained stuck in first gear. the cdc was the primary supplier of tests across much of the country, and other labs couldn't immediately deploy their own without the fda's blessing. hhs said it has assigned a team of outside scientists to examine what went wrong with the cdc's initial batch of tests, such as whether there was a manufacturing defect, flawed design or contamination in the agency's lab. the precise problem has not been identified. the cdc didn't send out new test kits until late february. meanwhile, public health experts say, a crucial window was closing on containing the virus, which by then was known to have infected more than 60 people. the us emergency declaration issued in late january created additional hurdles that hindered a wider expansion in testing, according to former federal officials and lab professionals. the declaration eased the way for drugmakers to pursue vaccines and antiviral treatments for covid-19. but public health experts said that the same declaration made it harder to expand diagnostic testing outside the cdc. that's because the declaration required diagnostic tests developed by individual labs, such as those at hospitals or universities, to undergo greater scrutiny than in non-emergencies - presumably because the stakes are higher. \"paradoxically, it increased regulations on diagnostics while it created an easier pathway for vaccines and antivirals,\" said dr amesh adalja, a senior scholar at the johns hopkins university centre for health security. \"there was a real foul-up with diagnostic tests that has exposed a flaw in the united states' pandemic response plan.\" dr william schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at the vanderbilt university school of medicine, said the cdc and fda stuck to their conventional playbook for too long. \"traditional public health thinking is, 'don't create widespread panic and don't go over the top. keep the \ntesting narrow in a precision rifle approach rather than a mass, shotgun approach,'\" schaffner said. \"that failed in this instance. this virus acted differently and it overwhelmed the us system. south korea had a much better sense of what was happening.\" in a statement tuesday, the cdc said: \"after finding out that some labs could not fully verify the test, cdc began working on a solution and identifying the source of the problem . cdc, in conjunction with fda, determined how to move forward and shared this information immediately with public health labs.\" the cdc statement also suggested that the agency was not exclusively responsible for testing delays. the cdc was \"not an impediment\" to getting large-scale commercial testing started, according to the statement. that was the role of the fda, and as the initial us cases were being detected in late january and early february, cdc director dr robert redfield highlighted the need for that agency to act, according to the cdc statement. alberto gutierrez, who led the fda's office overseeing diagnostic testing from 2009 to 2017, said the agency proceeded with caution because it saw itself as the last line of defense against opportunistic companies looking to cash in on threats to public health. \"there is money to be made in an emergency, and a lot of people try to take advantage of that,\" gutierrez said. \"the problem the fda faces is, do you let it become the wild west?\" \"the fda had good intentions,\" he said. ramping up in mid-february, cases spiked at a secretive church in the southeastern city of daegu. on february 26, daegu city officials said they would test every single member of the church, including those without symptoms. as of march 10, daegu said that it had tested almost all of the 10,000 members of the church in that area, and about 40% came back positive. the city, which now accounts for about three-quarters of total infections in south korea, has seen new cases sharply drop. on wednesday, officials \nannounced 46 new cases compared to a peak of 741 cases on february 29. the country went from two approved test makers on february 18 to five as of last week, according to the korean cdc. \"to my surprise, test kit makers were able to boost production quickly,\" korean cdc's lee sang-won said. pleading with washington by february 24, state and local labs in the united states were pleading with the fda to relax its rules so the nation no longer had to rely so heavily on the cdc for testing. they asked hahn, the fda commissioner, for \"enforcement discretion\" so they could use their own lab-developed tests. \"we are now many weeks into the response with still no diagnostic or surveillance test available outside of cdc for the vast majority of our member laboratories,\" scott becker, chief executive of the association of public health laboratories, and grace kubin, lab services director at the texas department of state health services, wrote to hahn on february 24 in a letter reviewed by reuters. in an interview, becker, whose group represents more than 100 state and local health laboratories, called the letter a \"hail mary\" pass, an act of desperation. \"the entire lab community was really coming unglued. we knew we could develop tests and were very capable of doing that, but we felt hamstrung\" becker told reuters. that same day, the trump administration confirmed the first death in the united states from the coronavirus, a man in his 50s in washington state. on march 2, stenzel at the fda's diagnostic testing office hosted a webinar for lab test developers, highlighting additional challenges, including a shortage of viral samples needed for validation of test results. some labs also have reported shortages of other key supplies and ingredients, as well as the need for more trained personnel. as us regulators rewrote their policies, south korean municipalities were opening roadside testing facilities across the country, collecting samples in minutes while people sat in their \ncars. at a closed-door meeting last week in congress, us representative raul ruiz, a democrat from california and an emergency-room physician who treated patients during the 2009 h1n1 influenza outbreak, pressed the fda commissioner and other members of the trump administration on why south korea was lapping the united states in its response. \"why don't we have drive-through testing like south korea?\" ruiz asked leaders of the president's coronavirus task force. ruiz told reuters the officials said they were working on it. on their own, some hospitals and communities have begun offering drive-through testing in colorado, new york, texas and elsewhere. in recent days, as the public criticism grew louder, trump appointed a testing czar to improve coordination across agencies. the fda launched a 24-hour hotline for laboratories needing help to accelerate testing, approved two company applications for higher-volume testing and granted states the flexibility to authorize new tests so labs can bypass the fda. despite the new moves, ruiz said he fears america is still weeks away from approaching what south korea has accomplished. \"i think months have been lost here,\" ruiz said. \"maybe we should look into purchasing south korea's tests.\" that may happen. both kogene and solgent co, two of the covid-19 test-makers approved in south korea, said their companies have an eye on the us market. \"the fda asked us to proceed with applications quickly,\" kogene executive myoah baek said.

"}, {"content": "Origin, symptoms, lethality ... what is known about China's new virus. The new coronavirus 2019-ncov emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan has caused one of the biggest health crises of recent years. What follows are the accretences and open questions about the episode. How did the bud started? The Chinese authorities reported on December 31, 21 cases of pneumonia of unknown origin, seven of them serious. Those affected were apparently linked to a market of the city of Wuhan, a great metropolis with 11 million inhabitants. The cause of the ailment was identified on January 7 as a new coronavirus. China reported days later that the pathogen could be transmitted from person to person. What symptoms cause the virus? The virus infects the respiratory tract and causes symptoms ranging from a mild box (dry cough, fever ...) to acute respiratory insufficiency and potentially fatal pneumonias. How is it contagious? The mechanisms have not been determined, although the most accepted form is through contact and through small drops of saliva than the bearer of the virus excreted when coughing. The contagion occurs between people who are close, at a distance of approximately one meter maximum. Are there asymptomatic cases? It is not yet known exactly, although experts consider that it is likely, as has occurred with other similar viruses. Is there a treatment? There is no specific treatment or vaccine, although there are several projects underway to achieve it. Medical assistance focuses on symptoms and giving vital support to the patient. Antivirals such as oseltamivir, Baloxavir, Ribavirin and Acyclovir are not effective against the virus. China studies the combined use of Lopinavir and Ritonavir. How is it diagnosed? China made public the genetic sequence of the virus on January 10, three days after identification. This allowed creating a specific diagnostic protocol with which all the \nmember countries. Without the analyzes, it is practically impossible to distinguish it from another type of pneumonia, or even a flu. The large hospitals have a technology, called PCR, which allows confirming the virus infection in a few hours, although in Spain the official confirmations depend on the National Center of Microbiology. What is the evolution of the disease? The number of affected has not stopped growing since December 31 and the trend continues to rise in both China and in other countries. Has the expansion of the virus been fast? Experts emphasize that the great speed of virus propagation. The cases recorded in China in less than a month - January 29, 6,000 have exceeded 5,300 diagnosed with SARS. What is a coronavirus? They are an extensive virus family that affect the human being and several species of animals. So far there were six acquaintances who could get sick from a person: four that cause the common cold, that of SARS (arising in 2002 also in China) and MERS (in 2012 in Saudi Arabia). Coronavirus that only affect some species can suffer mutations that allow them to jump to others and become virulent to the human being. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused more than 800 deaths and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) has caused 2,500 confirmed cases and 850 deaths. The investigations carried out so far aim that the origin of both is in bats and this is the main hypothesis also in Wuhan. What lethality does the new Wuhan virus have? Experts point out that the mortality rate of the new pathogen is low, between 2% and 3%, compared to similar viruses, according to the first available data. A mortality from 10% and 18% is attributed to the SAR virus, and that of the Mers reaches 35% of the patients notified, according to WHO. Could the virus mutate and get more \nvirulent? Although all viruses is likely to suffer a mutation, since it was located it has remained quite stable, as the WHO points out, which warns that it is a scenario that can not be ruled out. What measures have been adopted? China has decided to quarantine to the city of Wuhan, from which it is not possible to leave or enter from the past morning, and more than a dozen localities nearby. In them the use of masks has been widespread. In total, he has confined more than 46 million people. Airports of the vast majority of Asian countries, as well as the United States, the United Kingdom and Russia, among others, have established control measures to detect travelers with compatible symptoms from affected areas. Wuhan Airport remains practically closed. What is WHO doing? The organization has monitored the evolution of the outbreak practically from the first day, since it has located the Coronavirus among the threats to cause a future global pandemic. The Emergency Committee has met twice and, although very divided, has not decided for now to declare an international emergency, although in the last week of January it has changed \"moderate\" to \"high\" the rating of global threat posed by the virus . What does the international emergency statement imply? The declaration of an emergency of public health of international importance is adopted by a bud a \"serious, sudden, unusual and unexpected situation\" with sanitary consequences whose impact extends beyond the affected country. With the Declaration, the process is initiated that makes possible an immediate and coordinated international action. WHO has adopted this decision five times: by influenza A in 2009, against polio in 2014, against Ebola in West Africa in 2014, against Zika in 2016 and last July against Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo Is there a risk to Spain? The Ministry of Health considers that \"having in \nAccount the controls carried out by the Chinese authorities, the risk of introduction of the virus in Spain at this time is considered very low \". In any case, even if the virus arrived,\" the impact for public health \"would also be\" very low \" . How will the new coronavirus be called? At the moment, it has one provisional 2019-ncov (new virus 2019), but WHO will decide a definitive one. Normally, they are baptized with the name of where they were discovered, so it will probably be the Wuhan virus.

In times of fear of the new coronavirus detected in December, China, various events and cultural equipment have already been canceled, to avoid spread, but, on the other hand, search for books, films, series or games that address the theme of the pandemics, has been increasing since the beginning of the year.

And as fear sells, they are already running on social networks several predictions, one of them reported in the novel \"The Eyes of Darkness\", from the American writer of science fiction Dean Koontz. Published in 1981, with a reprint in 1989, the book has a chapter that speaks of a disease called Wuhan-400, which is actually a biological weapon created in that Chinese city. The page that describes the consequences of the virus became viral, especially on Twitter: \"They call you Wuhan-400 because it was created in one of the RDNA research labs at the doors of the city of Wuhan, and was the strain No. 400 of micro-organisms manufactured by man created in this center.

At the time, Microsoft's co-founder said a pathogen that spreads through the air and moves quickly \"could kill more than 30 million people in less than a year,\" although previously, in 2015, he had alerted during a lecture, That the world was not prepared \"for a next epidemic.\" more catastrophic is the description that the writer Sylvia Browne makes in his 2008 book \"End of Days: Predictions and prophections about the end of the world\", and that also spread through social networks, according to which a respiratory disease would burst all over The planet in the year 2020, and would not disappear until ten years.

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of Covid-19 as an international public health emergency and increased the risk to \"very high.\" "}, {"content": "what we don\u2019t yet know about the coronavirus. (reuters) - it has been only three months since reports first emerged from china of an unknown virus causing unusual cases of pneumonia, and scientists and public health experts already know more about it and how it works than at the same point in earlier outbreaks. but there\u2019s still a lot they don\u2019t know. as the new coronavirus continues to spread around the world, here are some of the most important questions researchers and doctors \u2013 as well as policymakers and economists \u2013 are still trying to answer: how contagious is the virus? the virus spreads from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth via coughing or sneezing, according to the world health organization (who). it can persist on most surfaces up to several days, so in addition to directly inhaling the virus, you can become infected by touching something that has been contaminated and then touching your own nose, mouth or eyes. there is some evidence that virus particles in the feces of an infected person can transmit the disease through contact, but that remains unconfirmed. how many people are infected, and how many do not show any symptoms? so far, more than 550,000 cases have been reported worldwide, of which more than 127,000 have recovered and more than 24,000 have died. some researchers estimate that up to 80% of people who are infected show no or only mild symptoms and may not even know they are sick. that would put the number of people who might have been infected in the millions. but we need many more studies and much more testing to close in on a more accurate number. graphic: tracking the spread of the coronavirus, here are younger people less likely to die from the virus? younger people, while less vulnerable, can still develop covid-19 - the disease caused by the sars-cov-2 coronavirus -  severe enough to require hospitalization. just how much safer they are is still unanswered. the who says older people with pre-existing \nconditions - such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, high blood pressure, diabetes and heart disease - appear to develop serious illness more often than others, while a u.s. health official said the mortality rate in males appears to be twice that of women in every age group. health officials have cautioned that anyone with those underlying conditions, as well as those with weakened immune systems, are at increased risk. can people be re-infected? this is a key question \u2013 and we don\u2019t yet know the answer. there are a handful of cases of possible \u201creinfection\u201d in recovered patients. but most scientists believe those are more likely to have been relapses. a patient may feel better and test negative for the virus in their nose and throat, while the virus remains elsewhere in their body. fully recovered patients have antibodies in their blood that should protect them from fresh infection, but we don\u2019t know how long those antibodies will last. with some viruses, antibodies fade faster. even if they do persist, sars-cov-2 might undergo small changes over time, as flu viruses do each year, rendering the antibodies ineffective. several academic laboratories and medical companies are looking to produce blood tests to figure out who has been exposed to the virus and whether some people have developed immunity. serological testing will also give a better picture of the full extent of the pandemic. do we know when there will be treatments or a vaccine? no. so far there are no vaccines or antiviral medicines specific to the new coronavirus. treatment for now focuses on relieving symptoms such as breathing assistance. companies around the world are racing to develop vaccines. a few have launched early safety testing in humans, but experts say it could take a year or more to develop and test a vaccine. another complication: viruses can mutate quickly. some scientists have already identified subtle changes since sars-cov-2 emerged in wuhan, china, in december. but \nrecent studies show the virus is relatively stable, which suggests vaccines should still be effective when they become available. does the virus spread more slowly in hot places? some experts had hoped that the onset of summer will naturally slow the virus. but the european centre for disease control said on wednesday that it is unlikely to diminish its spread. the who has also said that the virus can be transmitted in all areas, including hot and humid climates. how long will the pandemic last? we don\u2019t know. it will depend on a range of factors, from how long people continue to isolate and avoid group gatherings to when effective drugs or a vaccine become available. president donald trump said this week that he hopes to \u201creopen\u201d the u.s. economy by easter sunday on april 12. but he has faced criticism that such a timetable is too rushed and could lead to more people dying. in hubei province, the epicenter of china\u2019s coronavirus outbreak, life has started to return to normal after two months of lockdown. it remains to be seen whether such a return to normal spurs another outbreak. does the amount of exposure to the virus determine how sick someone gets? viruses enter the body and infect cells, using them as factories to make many millions of copies of themselves, so the number of virus particles that first enter the body has little effect on the eventual amount of virus in the system. at the same time, more frequent exposure does increase the chance that the virus will enter the body in the first place. when will the economy return to normal? the international monetary fund expects the pandemic will cause a global recession in 2020 that could be worse than the one triggered by the 2008 financial crisis. the depth of a recession, how long it will last and the nature of the recovery are a matter of debate. economists say it will largely depend on how long the lockdowns last \u2013 around a quarter of all humanity is currently in lockdown \u2013 and how far government support \ngoes in helping individuals, businesses and markets survive the crisis. are the trillions of dollars in emergency spending helping? central bank measures have sought to keep financial markets functioning, including areas that keep the real economy humming, such as the markets where companies go to raise short term cash to pay staff and where cities go to raise money for roads and schools. steps taken by governments, such as the $2 trillion u.s. stimulus package, are expected to further help the economy by putting cash in the hands of individuals and providing additional funding to small businesses and companies. such measures still need to work through the system, however, and it remains unclear whether they will be enough. is it a good time to invest?

are ramping up surveillance efforts with new data collection campaigns to better trace residents\u2019 moves in public areas, seeking to curb the coronavirus outbreak but heightening privacy concerns. at least 15 provinces and cities with a combined population of over 358 million have announced such \u201cbig data\u201d measures this month, adding to a host of monitoring tools already being used, such as facial recognition and phone data tracking. visitors to office buildings, shopping malls, residential compounds and metro systems are now being asked to scan qr codes using their mobile phones and fill in forms asking for information such as their travel history and body temperature, according to residents and local media reports. some regions are also instructing residents to use newly

guidance at checkpoints as to whether the person should be quarantined or let through. the outbreak, traced to the hubei provincial capital of wuhan, has killed 2,715 so far and stricken about 78,000

currently open to the public. other people who say they have been quarantined using big data have questioned its accuracy. a hangzhou resident who only wanted to be identified by his surname hu told reuters police came to his house and said he was detected as being in contact with someone infected by the coronavirus. but hu said he had not met face-to-face with the infected person, who was a friend, and they last spoke in november through a messaging app. hu is now in quarantine at his home. \u201cmy residential committee and the police station understand the situation but can not help

made by china-asean \ninformation harbor, which describes itself on its website as a state-backed technology platform created to aid china\u2019s \u201cbelt and road\u201d initiative. alipay created

however, many other commodities, goods and services will also be significantly affected. companies such as h&m, japan airlines, baidu inc, mcdonald's and tesla have all recently warned that the outbreak in china will have an impact on their businesses. bcp for the novel coronavirus is proving to be difficult, requiring businesses to consider operational and financial risks alongside health risks to one of their most valuable assets: talent. safeguarding the wellbeing of employees plays an important role in keeping a company operational during this uncertain time. while practices implemented by companies have delved into infection control measures such as personal hygiene and social distancing, challenges in maintaining employee morale have not been discussed with the same fervor. some important issues to consider in bcps include how to handle fear and xenophobia that have arisen due to concerns over the novel coronavirus. bcp designated personnel need to consider how to manage anxiety in the workplace, even over scenarios that would be benign during normal times, such as an employee who shows up to work with a minor cough. businesses that choose to implement work from home arrangements for large swathes of the workforce will need to consider how to help employees who are not accustomed to working remotely stay motivated during this time, alongside infrastructure concerns \nsuch as bandwidth and capacity issues for remote access of work servers, conferencing lines and other necessities. moreover, managers must consider how to balance their legal responsibility to treat all employees fairly against any measures the company may have to take to mitigate the risk of widespread infection at their firms. consideration for the mental wellbeing of employees needs to be factored in alongside practices to safeguard their physical health against illness. planning for an extended and uncertain period time in which businesses may have to run on contingency measures is another significant consideration for businesses. the novel coronavirus remains somewhat of a mystery. health agencies are in the midst of containment efforts; however, it is uncertain how long these initiatives may take to bring regional outbreaks under control, or if these initiatives will be successful at all in preventing more widespread infection. as a result, businesses must examine how they will function under different scenarios and at varying percentages of operational capacity. critical tasks will have to be identified and many organizations will have to make tough decisions weighing risk against productivity just in order to stay afloat. *to read more by the thomson reuters regulatory intelligence team click here: bit.ly/tr-regintel (by helen chan, regulatory intelligence) "}, {"content": "breakingviews - china\u2019s viral immune system open to economic pox. hong kong (reuters breakingviews) - china\u2019s political system has weak immunity to viruses. a bungled swine flu cover-up doubled pork prices last year. now a mysterious outbreak of pneumonia is panicking citizens just days before the start of what\u2019s usually a $150 billion spending boom: the lunar new year holiday. president xi jinping\u2019s corruption purge may have made officials less venal, but not, apparently, more credible.\nconcealing epidemics, environmental crises, and product scandals was once reflexive behaviour for local governments. burying bad news can head off career-ending popular protests. now officials\u00a0must manage the flow of facts and rumour\u00a0about a virus that emerged in wuhan,\u00a0a large city in central china.\nwhen it comes to infectious disease,\u00a0local\u00a0censorship slows medical response and facilitates transmission. that\u2019s what happened with the\u00a0severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars)\u00a0in 2003, a coronavirus similar to that found in wuhan. sars killed nearly 800 people, docked a percentage point from china\u2019s economic growth, and erased up to $18 billion in travel, tourism and retail sales in asia, according to one academic estimate.\nbeijing scored transparency points with its handling of the h7n9 avian flu in 2013, but\u00a0then\u00a0fumbled\u00a0its\u00a0response to african swine flu, which\u00a0some\u00a0officials\u00a0initially\u00a0tried to cover up.\u00a0around half of china\u2019s herd had to be culled.\ndistrust is a tax that distorts consumption. after the sichuan earthquake in 2008, some residents of the provincial capital disregarded official reassurances, hoarding bottled water\u00a0and camping\u00a0outside for months on end, refusing to believe their buildings were safe.\u00a0the 2011 fukushima nuclear accident in japan caused a bizarre rush on iodized salt in china.\nthe coronavirus has already killed four and infected hundreds. it has spread overseas.\u00a0with an estimated 400 million chinese planning to travel for the holiday, the question is how many will still go and spend.\nxi\u2019s massive purge of\u00a0corrupt\u00a0officials made him popular, but it was packaged with tighter control of media, and suppression of negative economic commentary. this encourages officials to report only good news, so some will naturally try to control disease outbreaks before they become public. when that backfires, the result is personal tragedy and economic waste.

acute respiratory syndrome) pandemic in 2003, the resources of a family clinic in choa chu kang had been stretched thin.   personal protective equipment -\u00a0n95 respirators, sterile gloves and full-body gowns -\u00a0was scarce at a time when the world had never seen a virus like it, and people everywhere were desperately scrambling to stockpile emergency supplies for themselves.   dr tan tze lee, a general practitioner at the edinburgh clinic, recalled the difficulties that frontline healthcare workers faced when procuring equipment to protect themselves from the killer virus.   by the time sars was contained in may 2003, it had infected 238 people and killed 33 in singapore. two in five of those infected had been healthcare workers.   while dr tan\u2019s clinic thankfully encountered no cases, it remained on high alert for sars\u00a0patients in the four months of the epidemic in singapore, throughout which the medical staff had to don full protective gear. but everyone was not ready for the crisis, said dr tan, who is also president of the college of family physicians singapore.   many continued to work but were extremely concerned that they might bring the virus home and put their loved ones at risk, he added.   \u201cthe healthcare practitioners in singapore were ill-prepared, which resulted in sombre outcomes. since then, we have learnt our lesson and measures were instituted to prepare us for any future pandemic event.\u201d   \u201chere we are today, ready to fight the 2019-ncov,\u201d he said.   the current outbreak of the wuhan coronavirus -\u00a0or 2019-ncov, the world health organization\u2019s (who) temporary name for the virus -\u00a0was first confirmed in singapore on jan 23. to date, all cases were imported, including a singaporean who was in wuhan, and there has been no evidence of community spread in the republic.   the who has yet \nto declare the virus -\u00a0which has spread to several countries -\u00a0as a pandemic. nevertheless, it was declared a global health emergency on friday (jan 31).   the first cases were reported in wuhan in china\u2019s hubei province and believed to be linked to the huanan seafood wholesale market, which sells live animals.   at the heart of singapore's response plan is the\u00a0disease outbreak response system (dors), a crisis management plan which did not exist in 2003, but was drafted after sars\u00a0and refined again in the wake of the swine flu (or h1n1) pandemic in 2009.      \u201cafter sars, we made a thorough review of the facilities we had \u2013 the infrastructure, hospitals, isolation wards, and the scientific testing and capabilities,\u201d said prime minister lee hsien loong at the sidelines of the world economic forum in davos, switzerland, last week.   \u201ci think we are much better prepared now.\u201d   currently, singapore is at dors\u00a0condition (dorscon) yellow, signifying that the virus is severe and can infect from person to person, but is chiefly occurring outside singapore. the next step up is dorscon\u00a0orange, which would have applied in the case of sars, whereby the virus is spreading in singapore but not widely, and is being contained.   while the plans are in place and some measures have kicked in, singapore\u2019s national strategy is still largely untested -\u00a0since the wuhan coronavirus is believed to be in its early stages in the republic, medical experts and sars veterans said.   however, there are ample signs that the lessons from sars are being applied as singapore shores up its defences, they said. they believe that unlike during\u00a0sars, singapore is far more ready now.   lessons learnt   singapore has had two brushes with pandemics in recent memory -\u00a0sars and h1n1.   while singapore was able to contain and recover from both, the varying nature of the viruses, as well as the changes in medical science, meant that dealing with each required different approaches.   doctors had limited \noptions when treating sars patients and could only administer supportive care, and there was nothing that could be done to prevent infection. in comparison, vaccines and treatment options were available when h1n1 claimed 18 lives in singapore and infected more than 400,000 people, out of which about 1,300 had to be hospitalised.   command and control   sars\u00a0first arrived in singapore in late february 2003, and was detected in\u00a0a woman with an atypical pneumonia on march 1, 2003 at tan tock seng hospital (ttsh). at the time, no one knew how deadly and virulent it was and the first patient led to a cluster of 42 cases at the hospital.   a ministry of health (moh) taskforce was set up on mar\u00a015, two weeks after the mysterious strain appeared in singapore and three days after the who issued a global alert on the outbreak that began in hong kong.   but the command and control structure then was \u201cwholly inadequate\u201d in a crisis situation that was both fluid and unprecedented, a study in the austrian journal of south-east asian studies concluded in 2012.      the structure was led by the health authorities, when in hindsight, it required \u201cmore than a medical approach since resources had to be drawn from a number of government agencies that did not fall under the rubric of the moh\u201d, said authors allen lai and tan teck boon, who were from the lee kuan yew school of public policy.   they noted that it took five weeks after the first case was reported for the bureaucracy to adapt, though by then, the outbreak had already spread quickly out of ttsh.   on april 7, 2003, a national control structure was created in response to sars, comprising a nine-member inter-ministerial committee led by then home affairs minister wong kan seng to provide strategic and political directions during health crises.   helping to coordinate across silos were a core executive group of senior civil servants, and an operations committee spanning ministries. their functions were later consolidated during \nthe h1n1 crisis, which meant that this leaner bureaucracy was quicker to respond to emerging situations on the ground.   with the wuhan coronavirus, observers said that it was evident that the government had reacted more quickly than in sars and h1n1 when it came to establishing a multi-disciplinary decision-making body.   professor ooi eng eong, an infectious diseases expert and virologist at the saw swee hock school of public health, noted that a multi-ministry taskforce on the wuhan coronavirus was formed on jan 22, several hours before the first suspected case came to the attention of the authorities at 10pm the same day. the patient - a 66-year-old chinese national tourist from wuhan - tested positive the next day, becoming the first confirmed case in singapore.   \u201cif you look at the response time, it is a fact that the ministerial committee formed before the case appeared, and we can see that a lot of systems are\u00a0already in place, occurring across ministries and not as siloed as back then when sars caught us all by surprise,\u201d said prof ooi, who is also deputy director of the emerging infectious diseases programme at duke-nus medical school.   the taskforce was formed to direct the whole-of-government response to the outbreak, coordinate the public\u2019s response and work with the international community.   jointly chaired by health minister gan kim yong and national development minister lawrence wong, the taskforce comprises a cross-section of cabinet ministers spanning various portfolios. they are:   dr chia shi-lu, a tanjong pagar grc member of parliament who chairs the government parliamentary committee for health, said that this time, the chain of command is clearer.   he noted that even before the taskforce was formed, the moh had already begun tracking the outbreak in china at the start of the year. temperature screening measures were put in place at changi airport from as early as jan 3.   but the high political signature of the panel had led some to \nquestion whether too many cooks were spoiling the broth, dr chia noted. \u201cin fact, some have asked me: are we overdoing it?\u201d he said.   \u201ci believe it is very important for everybody to come into the picture -\u00a0you have to, because at this early stage, (the outbreak) affects so many different parts and you need leadership from them, and you cannot rely solely on moh to coordinate everything,\u201d he added.      infrastructure, case management and isolation   while information about the wuhan virus is still emerging, singapore\u00a0is not in the same position as in the initial stages of the sars outbreak in 2003, where it was -\u00a0in the words of then health minister lim hng kiang - \u201cflying blind\u201d.   during the sars crisis, singapore only had two means to detect those infected with the virus: their clinical symptoms and their travel history. detecting these were not easy at the time as temperature screeners were also a rare resource, unlike today.   \u201cwe have to depend on people taking temperature, and we have to depend on people being truthful to us in their contact history,\u201d said mr lim then, describing sars as a tremendous challenge.   dr tan yia swam, first vice-president of the singapore medical association (sma), said that in the sars crisis, \u201cthere were too many unknowns, and precautions came too late, and too slowly\u201d. sars was zoonotic in nature, with the disease starting in animals before spreading to humans.   as a result, policies and procedures regarding risk stratification, contact mapping, contact tracing, quarantine and others were developed on the fly as the epidemic erupted, she said.   \u201ctoday, all of the above have been developed and tested before in exercises and they are now put into action. of course, these plans, policies and procedures must be modified in line with the epidemiology of the disease, but we are not working from scratch, unlike the past experience with sars,\u201d she added.      addressing the media on monday, mr lawrence wong said that in the \ntaskforce\u2019s national response to the virus, it is able to \u201cmarshal all available resources\u201d to tackle the scourge.   in terms of capacity, singapore has already beefed up its healthcare and isolation capacity since 2003. this includes the 330-bed national centre for infectious diseases that opened last year, and new hospitals such as khoo teck puat hospital in 2010, ng teng fong general hospital in 2015, and sengkang general hospital in 2018, he said.   during sars, ttsh was known as \u201csarscentral\u201d, the designated hospital to handle patients. this was borne out of a policy to restrict transmission of the virus to other hospitals, after a patient - who was unaware that he had been infected with the virus during his stay in ttsh - created a new viral cluster at singapore general hospital (sgh) when he went there for a surgical problem after his discharge from ttsh.   this policy changed in 2009 during the h1n1 outbreak, with the health ministry imposing a standardised infection control measure on all healthcare facilities, empowered by timely tweaks to the infectious diseases act. more than 400 family clinics were made \u201ch1n1-ready\u201d and equipped with the tamiflu vaccine to handle the outbreak.      similarly, all public hospitals are capable of handling the wuhan virus today, and come equipped with isolation rooms, which were in short supply in 2003.   when it came to medical supplies, dr chia recalled how there was hardly a stockpile of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers then, such as n95 respirators.   \u201cbecause an n95 mask needs to fit well for it to perform its function, having a properly fitted mask was (hard to come by) during sars, and we had to find time to do the fitting too,\u201d said dr chia, who was an orthopaedic surgeon at sgh at the height of the crisis.   \u201ctoday, most of us are already fitted with our own personal equipment, even as new staff. everything is in place today,\u201d he said.      for the general public, the government will be \ndisbursing a pack of four surgical masks\u00a0to each of the 1.37 million singapore households in a one-off exercise between feb 1 and feb 9. this was also done in 2003 when all households received a free emergency kit, containing n95 masks and themometers.   this time round, the mask distribution comes amid long queues at pharmacies around the island as people clamour to buy masks, and retailers say their stocks of surgical masks and n95 masks are running low or sold out. the government had released 5 million masks from its stockpile over nine days to the retailers but they were all snapped up in hours.   said dr chia: \u201cthe message is that there is enough for the whole of the population and in reserve too.\u201d   sma\u2019s dr tan said his association met with the college of family physicians singapore over the chinese new year weekend to carry out \u201ccomplex logistics arrangements\u201d to ensure that there is a steady supply of surgical and n95 masks to replenish stocks for the frontline healthcare workers.   \u201cwe are all monitoring the situation closely, and are ready to step up efforts when the need arises,\u201d he said.   experts noted that contingency plans have been put in place too - student hostels are converted into quarantine facilities in anticipation of future cases, and the outward bound singapore on pulau ubin has been marked as a possible quarantine site.      tricky balance in the face of imponderables   on monday, mr lawrence wong also called on singaporeans to be psychologically prepared that the wuhan virus could be worse than sars given the many \u201cimponderables\u201d and \u201cuncertainties\u201d regarding the infection, though he stressed that there is still no evidence of community spread of the disease in singapore.   over the past week, however, the first reports of human-to-human transmissions outside of china have surfaced in taiwan, japan, vietnam and germany.   mr lawrence wong said singapore\u2019s approach \u201cis to anticipate and move as swiftly as we can\u201d. \u201cbut every action we take \nreally has to be based on evidence, data and international medical guidelines,\u201d he added.      unlike sars, which impacted singapore when little was known about it, there is now a greater understanding about the coronavirus, a family of viruses that include the wuhan strain and sars.   but data gaps still exist, said professor tikki elka pangestu, a visiting fellow at the lee kuan yew school of public policy and a former director of the who\u2019s research policy and cooperation department in geneva.   prof pangestu said that not much is known of the proportion of mild and asymptomatic cases versus the severe and fatal ones, which currently makes it difficult to evaluate the wuhan virus\u2019 true epidemic potential and complicates the outbreak response.   there is also the worry that the virus could mutate into a more virulent and more highly transmissible strain. \u201cthis needs close monitoring and another data gap will be in how quickly this development can be evaluated,\u201d he said.   despite these gaps, singapore has \u201creacted much more swiftly and comprehensively\u201d than in 2003, prof pangestu added.      a rule of thumb for any country\u2019s approach in health crises, he said, is to base decisions on scientific evidence and rational analysis in the context of its own capacities.   \u201ci think the singapore approach is the correct one given the current information and evidence available -\u00a0robust but not over-reactive and flexible enough to accommodate new developments,\u201d said prof pangestu.   he noted that overreaction risks imposing an unjustifiable burden on the country, potentially impacting normal daily routines and the livelihoods of certain vulnerable segments of the population. under-reaction, on the other hand, would lead to a more extensive spread of the virus.   \u201ccalibrating the balance is tricky, but as i said, base your decisions on the existing scientific evidence,\u201d said prof pangestu.   prof ooi from the saw swee hock school of public health added: \u201cthere is a risk and \ncost to overreaction and a cost to an under-reaction. nobody knows what is the right answer and there is no hard science to it -\u00a0this is a judgement call and there is no right or wrong.\u201d   where there is a dearth of knowledge on imported pandemic cases, singapore\u2019s national strategy is flexible with the changing circumstances, and the plan recommends taking border control measures that would \u201cerr on the side of caution with more intense efforts until such time when the disease profile becomes clearer\u201d.   addressing the media on friday, mr lee said: \u201ci think as a government, in a way, we are overreacting\u00a0because we are trying to look ahead to see what can go wrong and take preemptive steps to prevent that from happening.\u201d   within a week, the taskforce moved from allowing travellers from wuhan to enter singapore while subject to enhanced screening on monday, to imposing a complete entry ban on all nationalities who have been to china in the past 14 days on friday.   the immigration and checkpoints authority has also stopped issuing all forms of new visas to those with people\u2019s republic of china passports.   handling a psychological crisis   although the memory of sars may have faded for some, experts say that the psychological lessons from it have remained until today, such that more singaporeans are aware of the need to cooperate with the authorities during a health crisis.   for example, social media is rife with examples of singaporeans calling out bad actors, such as online sellers who hoard surgical masks to resell, or profiteering behaviour by certain businesses. the government has also acted quickly to combat such behaviour.\u00a0but dr leong hoe nam, an infectious disease specialist at mount elizabeth novena hospital, believes that the sars legacy can also be a double-edged sword: the prospect of another sars-like epidemic might lead to needless panic, or worse, \u201ckiasuism\u201d.      in a viral outbreak, being\u00a0\u00a0\u201ckiasu\u201d means that people only think for themselves, \npreventing mutual cooperation from happening, he said.   urging singaporeans to do better, dr leong said they should be prepared for the viral outbreak but not overdo it. if fear and panic take hold, they can overwhelm the country\u2019s response \u201clike a tsunami\u201d, he said.   this means singapore\u2019s national response has to preemptively address concerns that could lead to panic, he said.   \u201cyou have no time to get ready. better to be ready (for the worst) now than not ready at all \u2026 there is little room for mistakes (that create more panic),\u201d said dr leong.      dr chia believes that singaporeans are generally behaving in a rational way so far, based on his conversations with residents as an mp or his interactions with patients.   \u201cduring sars, there was a lot more fear and a sense of real danger for everyone. we had people trying to evade quarantine, refusing to cooperate or going for medical screening \u2026 but so far there are no cases of people who are trying to evade authorities, in other countries, yes, but not among singaporeans,\u201d he said.   the rise of social media, which was non-existent during sars\u00a0, can also give rise to disinformation that fuels further panic.   on the threat of fake news, sma\u2019s dr tan said: \u201csocial media may do more harm than good in this kind of situation where fake news may spread faster than a virus and trigger unwanted behaviours. we urge all readers to exercise judgement when reading stories from various sources, and to keep referencing to official websites for accurate information.\u201d   stronger legislation   compared with the sars\u00a0crisis, singapore has more legislative levers now to deal with fake news and anti-social behaviour -\u00a0the protection from online falsehoods and manipulation act being one of them.   lesser known are the many enhancements to the infectious diseases act over the years since 2003, which give the authorities greater powers to enforce orders that were issued in the fight against a gazetted outbreak.   the act allows \npeople who break home quarantine orders to be arrested without a warrant and to be jailed or fined on conviction. it was amended last year to allow officers to use \u201cphysical means\u201d to enforce the order by bringing an absconder back to the place of isolation, in lieu of arrest.   it also makes explicit that persons under legal orders that restrict their movement in singapore, would not be allowed to leave the country, unless otherwise permitted.   the breadth of such powers in singapore gives the authorities the ability to ensure that evasion tactics, such as those described by dr chia, cannot happen again. the issue became such a problem during the sars\u00a0crisis that the health authorities had to resort to draconian measures, such as installing video surveillance cameras in the homes of people who were ordered to be quarantined.   the lack of legal powers has created some difficulties for several foreign governments in dealing with the wuhan coronavirus. earlier this week, two japanese citizens who were brought back to japan from wuhan on a chartered flight declined to go for medical screening when they landed in tokyo.   prime minister shinzo abe told the japanese parliament: \"while quarantine officers did their best to persuade them to go for further tests, they refused, and unfortunately there is no legal basis to force them to do so.\"   moral suasion and importance of public comms   but over the longer term, evidence suggests that government measures such as quarantine and travel restrictions are not as effective as instilling a voluntary sense of social etiquette and responsibility among the people.   having a buy-in from the public is especially essential when the authorities need the people\u2019s support to carry out certain measures, noted prof pangestu.      prof pangestu said: \u201cyou need the public\u2019s cooperation for your measures to be successful, such as to follow good hygiene practices, be alert to any symptoms, promptly seeking healthcare, awareness of \npotential risks, and to counter the spread of misinformation on social media.\u201d   this will be critical during the \u201csurge response\u201d - when situational changes cause a sudden need for the authorities to ramp up its measures, such as activating quarantine sites that are being held in reserve.   a lack of moral suasion would erase the ability for the government to implement these measures, experts said. they noted how in hong kong, protesters bombed a general hospital and a residential building that the authorities had wanted to use as a possible quarantine facility.   over the past week, south korean protesters -\u00a0mostly residents -\u00a0also used tractors to block access to facilities earmarked as quarantine centres in the cities of asan and jincheon, which are about 80km from seoul.   experts said cooperation from the masses largely relies on public education as well as proper and accurate communication of risk, which is not always a guarantee considering the complex flow of information in a crisis situation that can lead to miscommunication.   an april 2003 article in the straits times,\u00a0\"all the right moves for sarsbut info\u2019s a bit slow, no?\",\u00a0by its then\u00a0news editor bertha henson, described how the moh was asked at a press conference to confirm a tipoff that sgh nurses might have sars. the authorities said no, but it later emerged the next day that 21 sgh staff were on the sars suspect list.   \u201cthe kindest thing i can say about this sudden announcement is that the ministry gets its information later than the media,\u201d wrote ms henson then.   referring to the incident, professor chee yam cheng, the current president of the singapore medical council, wrote in a series of memos about sars in 2003 that \u201cquick dissemination of information -\u00a0and accurate information -\u00a0is almost as important as transparency in a health emergency\u201d.   prof pangestu believes that in general, singaporeans are united and support what the government is trying to do to contain the situation.   \u201cbut \npublic reaction is hard to control especially with fake news on social media. the idea that \u2018perception is reality, anything is the truth\u2019 often operates in this kind of (crisis) environment. that is why public risk communication is so important,\u201d he said.   download our app or subscribe to our telegram

Find out which one. A team of Chinese scientists has shown that pangolins are coronavirus carriers closely related to SARS-COV-2, causing current pandemic, but not enough to conclude that they are directly responsible for the transmission of virus to humans.\r\nSARS-COV-2 emerged in a Wuhan (China) market in which wild animals were sold and, although there are evidence that suggests that bats are the reservoir of the syndrome, today scientists continue without knowing what animal can be the intermediate guest which facilitated the transmission of virus to humans.\n\nToday, a genomic study, led by the Chinese virologists Yi Guan, from the University of Hong Kong, and Yan-Ling Hu, from the University of Medicine of Guangxi, published in Nature magazine, advances that Malaysian Pangolins are patients with CORONViruses related to SARS- COV-2.\nThe similarity between these coronaviruses and what caused the pandemic is not enough to confirm that the pangolins are guests who have transmitted the current beat of bats to humans, but the discoveries suggest that these wild mammals are \"a second Coronavirus guest \", so the sale in wild fauna markets should be strictly prohibited to avoid future transmissions, warn scientists.\nIn the study, they recall that shortly after the start of the outbreak, the Wuhan market - the initial focus of the infection - was dismantled, which prevented the animal species in which coronavirus arose.\nOne possible guest could be Pangolim, the most trafficked mammal and who uses as food and traditional Chinese medicine.\nFor work, Yi Guan and colleagues analyzed samples from 18 Malaysian Pangolins seized in fighting operations against Contrabando in southern China, between August 2017 and January 2018, and in all found different types of coronaviruses.\nThe viruses of these samples had a genetic similarity between 85% to 92% with SARS-COV-2.\nIn addition, in one of these viruses, the region that facilitates the entry into the cell is very similar to that of the current virus.\nNevertheless, none of the coronavirus of Pangolim had the specific alteration of human SARS-COV-2, which raises doubts that pangolins are directly responsible in the transmission of coronavirus to humans.\nStill, the authors of the study warn that the pangolins should not sell themselves in markets and propose greater surveillance of these animals to understand their role in the emergence of coronavirus with potential to infect human beings.\nThe new coronavirus, responsible for the pandemic of Covid-19, has already infected 480,000 people around the world, of which about 22,000 died.\nAfter arising in China, in December, the outbreak spread all over the world, which led the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a pandemic situation.\nThe European continent, with almost 260,000 infected, is the one that is currently emerging as many cases. Italy is the country of the world with more deadly victims - with 7,503 dead, in 74,386 cases registered until Wednesday.\nSpain is the second country with the highest number of deaths, registering 4,089, between 56,188 cases of infection confirmed to date.\nChina, not counting with the territories of Hong Kong and Macao, has 81,285 cases (more than 74,000 recovered) and registered 3,287 deaths. In the last 24 hours, it reported six deaths and 67 new cases, all originated abroad, when the country begins to return to normality, after two months of paralysis.\nIn Portugal, there were 60 deaths, 17 more than 17 than on Wednesday (+ 39.5%), and 3,544 confirmed infections, according to the balance sheet made today by the Directorate-General for Health, which identified 549 new cases in relation to Wednesday (+ 18.3%).\nOf the infected, 191 are hospitalized, 61 of which in intensive care units, and there are 43 patients who have recovered.

The new coronavirus can infect at least one in 20 people in the city of Wuhan, China, when a peak reached in the coming weeks, according to the forecast of scientists who established models for the spread of the virus. The trend supported in the cases reported in Wuhan \"widely support\" mathematical models that London School of Hygiene & Tropical is using to predict the transmission of dynamic epidemic, according to the scientists of this institution, quoted this Sunday by the Bloomberg financial information agency . \"Assuming that current trends remain, we are designing a peak in the middle / final of February\" in Wuhan, said the associated professor of infectious disease epidemiology Adam Kucharski at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical, quoted by Bloomberg. Kucharski, who works with mathematical analysis in outbreaks of infectious diseases, explained that \"there is a lot of uncertainty, hence it is cautious about choosing a single value for peak, but it is possible based on current data, see a peak prevalence above 5% \". Wuhan, the Chinese city where the 2019-NCOV virus emerged at the end of last year, quarantined since January 23, and the movement of 11 million people is restricted. Health authorities in China and around the world are eager to know if the highest quarantine known in the world has the effectiveness of containing pneumonia caused by the new virus in Wuhan and in other cities of the province of Hubei, region in which they live 60 millions of people. Mapping the outbreak of Coronavirus worldwide, Kucharski, as well as his colleagues at the British institution, based their models in a set of hypotheses about the 2019-NCOV virus. These include a period of incubation of 5.2 days, delay at the beginning of the symptoms for confirmation of the infection of 6.1 days and the risk of infection between the 10 million people who were \nidentified as the most vulnerable in Wuhan. Based on those data, a prevalence of 5% amounts to about 500,000 infections in total. This is often more than 14,982 cases, that the provincial health authorities had reported in Wuhan until 20:00 on Saturday night in China. \"The next two weeks are really critical to understand what is happening,\" said, in turn, Benjamin Cowling, head of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Hong Kong, in an interview in Melbourne on Thursday, cited by Bloomberg . They will also be critical, warned, to know \"if the virus is spreading to other locations or if we have avoided what could be a global pandemic because of the control measures adopted and implemented so far.\" The number of deaths resulting from the outbreak of pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus (2019-NCOV) amounts to 813, of which 811 in continental China, where the number of infected exceeds 37 thousand. In the 24 hours that preceded the balance sheet this Sunday, the Chinese authorities registered in the continental territory 89 deaths and 2,656 new cases of infection with Coronavirus detected in December, in Wuhan, capital of the province of Hubei (center), placed under quarantine. The new balance already exceeds that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which between 2002 and 2003 caused death at 774 people around the world, most of which in China, but the mortality rate remains lower . So far, the only two deaths caused by the new coronavirus registered outside mainland China took place in the Philippines and Hong Kong. In addition to the continental territory of China and the Chinese regions of Macao and Hong Kong, there are more than 350 cases of contagion confirmed in 25 countries. In Europe, the number arrived on Sunday to 39, with two new infections detected in Spain in the United Kingdom. The World Health Organization (WHO), which declared on 30 January a health emergency situation \nInternational public, indicated on Saturday that contagion cases revealed daily in China are stabilizing, but stressed that it was early to conclude that the epidemic reached its peak.

It is also recommended to always find out about the current status of booked flights from the airlines. That is not uniformly regulated. The contracts of some providers include a pandemic exclusion. That is, the insurance does not have to pay if a customer infects during a pandemic with the appropriate pathogen. Some providers look from this possibility but from goodwill. Currently, insurers check whether their protection continues to apply if customers travel to a country that was classified by the Robert Koch Institute as a risk area. The validity of some foreign health insurance policies could accordingly still be restricted. Many insurers now publish FAQs with more information on their website.

If you want to cancel an already booked trip for fear of infection, without any concrete travel restrictions available, regardless of the Coronavirus, you can call on the cancellation rules agreed at the conclusion of the contract. If you can not cancel your journey yourself, but, for example, the airline strokes your connection, your ticket price is usually fully refunded. The same applies if a whole package tour is canceled.

Because the Chinese tourist groups, which were mostly more dominant in the streets, remain out. Guilt is the coronavirus. Many flights from and to China are currently deleted, two-thirds of the overnight stays of Chinese in Europe were canceled, estimates the European Tourist Association EtOa. What the skiers may be pleased, the hoteliers and boutiques operators. For the Chinese are not only a steadily growing tour group, but also a little bit of an infestation: For example, in Switzerland, they are almost three times as much as German guests. Countries with a lot of tourism are therefore the first, whose economy is hit by the coronavirus. But they will not stay the only ones. The virus has become a threat to the global economy. You can already see that at the reactions of the stock markets. The courses rustled not only in China after the local New Year. Nine percent minus recorded the Shanghai Composite Index on Monday. And when the Chinese stock exchanges were still closed in the week before, the international markets reacted. The German stock index Dax fell clearly last week on Monday, then recovered slightly to sink on Thursday. Overall, he lost 4.4 percent in the week. The Dow Jones in the United States fell by 3.5 percent in the same week. Even oil and copper, whose courses always react quickly, when the global economy is in danger, indicated significantly. Investors tend to exaggerate, but form pretty well, which is currently expected for the future. And the expectation is currently: care, this virus could be contagious. Contagious for the global economy. This is mainly because it broke out in China, a country that is highly intertwined with the rest of the world. to the \nExample of raw materials: 13.5 percent of the crude oil of the world and almost half of the crude steel went there last year. In 2002, the respective share was only about half as high. In consumption, China has also gained a meaning that should not be underestimated. Almost every third smartphone is sold today in China and more than every third car. The more intertwined other countries in turn with China and with the global economy, the more endangered they are if the virus paralyzes the Chinese economy for a long time. Germany is enormous globalized, as among other things, the export surplus, which was recently higher than in all other countries in the world. The most important export country is China. At the same time it is the most important importing country. As far as individual industries are concerned, the German auto industry is strongly bound to China. About every third car sell BMW, Daimler and Co. There, with Volkswagen it is even 40 percent. The dependency is great. But the virus can actually serve so much that it feels the entire German economy? The global economy can damage it in three ways. First, quite directly. For many people because of the health hazard stay at home, stay closed since stores, gyms, restaurants and partly whole factories, the domestic economy of China has almost come to a short time. Foreign companies feel that. Either because they sell less in China or because Chinese tourists cancel. Or, if you produce yourself in China, because production fails. This can quickly be over when the peak of the contagion is exceeded. Second, the virus of the global economy can damage about Chinese growth. If the epidemic lasts longer and reduces the growth over a longer period of time, the indirect effects on countries associated with China. Because in the episode, the companies invest less in China. and \nCountries that produce capital goods - Germany is strong here - are met. At the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities of the World Health Organization WHO reported an accumulation of pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause in the Central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the diseases. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days then a group released a group of the virologen Christian's premier from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 the first diagnostic test for the new virus, the researcher provisionally call 2019-NCOV. With the test, the virus can be detected in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, on which, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected. Both the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as well as Mers (MIDDLE East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses which have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more than 750 died. With the MERS virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronaviruses. Many of them relate to respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example. In China, several thousand persons are suffering from them, some of them - most of them with pre-existing conditions - have died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first infection cases outside of China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been in Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection with a tourist, who came back from Wuhan, on January 24, the first cases were in \nFrance known. Meanwhile, first cases were confirmed in Germany. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. The virus can cause pneumonia that can endally end. Since it is a viral illness, antibiotics do not help. Meanwhile, it is clear that the virus can be transferred from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transfers after a dozen cases were known in medical staff. Medizors assume that the virus is transmitted above all over droplet infection. The World Health Organization calculates, as announced on January 24, at the moment that an infected one cuts 1.4 to 2.5 other people. Contest these numbers, the virus is less contagious than SARS and also the viral flu. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals. That can not be said yet. The World Health Organization said on 28 January that about one-fifth of the reported cases through the virus will be seriously ill, so in case of doubt must be treated intensive care. According to reports, the first death pots were patients who had some severe pre-existing conditions. Even with other infectious diseases, people with pre-existing diseases are particularly endangered - for example at the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so change their genome. This can cause you to become more dangerous for people in the course of an outbreak - but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) expects no similar mortality to the current time as the outbreak of SARS. The third way is the most unlikely, but dangerous: a panic. Develops the epidemic \nIn China or even worldwide so dramatic that the confidence of investors decreases and courses crash worldwide, this can lead to a financial crisis. This is also debated at the moment because many economists feel the situation of the global economy as a fragile anyway. The American Kenneth Rogoff for about warns for a long time before the risks for a renewed financial crisis rise worldwide. In January, prominent economists discussed on the annual meeting of the American Economic Association on possible triggers. The virus was not yet a topic, but China. The country is under observation, as it has grown rapidly for years, but has been weakening for a long time. From the point of view of some observers, the real estate boom adopted a dangerous dimension, the debt also. Sometimes it only needs a trigger to tilt the whole situation. Especially since the central banks are not as strong worldwide as once, since they have spotted a lot of powder in the financial crisis. But can a virus really be a trigger for such a dramatic crisis? The look back could reason for the all-clear. The outbreak of infectious disease SARS in 2003, the Tsunami in Thailand and Indonesia (2004, 230,000 fatalities) or the reactor catastrophe in Fukushima (2011) had economically limited consequences. Already a few quarters after the catastrophe, the economy ran back to full tours. But the comparison with these events has his pitfalls. Natural disasters, which are destroyed houses, factories and roads, often lead to a special growth phase after a short time. Simply because the damage is repaired. Such a special economy is not to be expected after a disease wave. Because there are no houses or to build roads. The parallels to the SARS epidemic are also limited. \"You should not commit the mistake to orient yourself unreflected at this crisis,\" says Cyrus de la \nRubia, Chief Volkswirt of the Hamburg Commercial Bank. At that time, the Courses Just rose when the World Health Organization degraded the global health novel. Yes, they even put on an \"amazing rally\" according to De La Rubia. First, however, the health consequences are others. Already, after a few weeks, China is more dead through the new pathogen than throughout the SARS outbreak that lasted several months. Second, the economic conditions are basically different. In 2003, China was an emerging economic power, but its importance for world trade was even significantly lower than today. 17 years ago, less than five percent of global economic performance came from Chinese goods and services, today it is 19 percent. China has also become more important as buyers of exports. A business collapse in China should therefore be more internationally felt than before. How much the German economy could suffer that Timo Wollersh\u00e4user tries to estimate. He leads the economic department of the IFO Institute in Munich. For this he uses a software program with hundreds of equations where data on economic interdependence and previously observed interactions are stuck: the IFO economic model. In this program, Wollersh\u00e4user has entered the data for a scenario in which China's economic performance decreases by one percent. So strong was the decline of SARS. The economic consequences that the Coronavirus would have been for Germany would therefore be manageable: the growth in this country would only be 0.05 percent in this case. \"If the current epidemic doubles the Chinese economic growth twice as it was the case with SARS, it is likely to be about 0.1 percent lower in Germany.\" The consequences would be stronger than before, but no drama for the entire economy. The impact could therefore be so glimated \nBecause an epidemic initially dampens consumer demand: travel, restaurant visits, purchases. Much of this is away now and will not be made up. \"For Germany, however, it is practically irrelevant if consumption goes back to China,\" says Wollmersh\u00e4user. \"We barely deliver consumer goods there.\" Only when the Chinese order fewer machines and fewer cars - the second way of harming the virus of the economy - would that be noticeable for local exports. Often, however, such large acquisitions are only deferred in a crisis and later made up. Serious could be the consequences when the supply chains are disturbed. So, when China is longer than supplier of products for the local industry. About a tenth of all pre-products imported from abroad and capital goods relate to German companies from China. But it is not foreseeable how far actually delivery bottlenecks arise. This is difficult to say, because in China itself, the professionals swords to estimate the economic consequences. Roads and shops are now not only empty in Wuhan, where the infection began, but also in other major metropolises. Many companies have - partly at the arrangement of local authorities, partly due to their own decision - their offices still closed. In some regions, for example in Shanghai, the workers should stay at home until the 9th of February, in others, such as Beijing, the officially extended holiday season ended at the beginning of this week. \"Probably you will be able to refrain from the beginning next week, to what extent the workforce can work in the companies and to what extent it comes to problems in the supply chains,\" says Jens Hildebrandt, Managing Director of the German Chamber of Commerce in Beijing. Hildebrandt itself is currently working from home. This comes: Most predictions are still based on the assumption that the new virus calls a regional and temporally limited crisis \nhighlighted. If that should not beware, if the standstill in China lasts longer or Germany is more likely to be infected by the virus, then the economic damage can be predicted much harder.

to defer tax payments without interest or penalties for certain individuals and businesses negatively impacted, saying it would provide more than $200 billion of additional liquidity to the economy. trump also said he was ordering the small business administration to provide capital and liquidity to firms affected by the coronavirus by providing low-interest loans to small businesses in affected states and territories, effective immediately. and he suspended all travel from europe, with a few exceptions, to the united states for 30 days starting on friday. earlier, trump signed a $8.3 billion emergency spending bill to combat the spread of the virus and develop vaccines for the highly contagious disease. the u.s. federal reserve has cut interest rates by half a percentage point in its first emergency rate move since the height of the 2008 financial crisis. investors expect more cuts in the weeks ahead. china china said it had earmarked 110.5 billion yuan ($15.9 billion) to fight the epidemic. beijing has ramped up funding support for virus-hit regions and the country's central bank has cut several of its key rates, including the benchmark lending rate, and has urged banks to give cheap loans and payment relief to exposed companies. china will modify the environmental supervision of companies to help the resumption of production disrupted by the coronavirus epidemic, giving firms more time to rectify environmental problems. japan japan unveiled a second package of measures worth about $4 billion in spending to cope with the fallout of the coronavirus outbreak, focusing on support to small and \nmid-sized firms, as concerns mount about risks to the fragile economy. separately, bank of japan governor haruhiko kuroda has pledged to pump more liquidity into markets and step up asset buying. japan's central bank may also take steps to ensure companies hit by the coronavirus outbreak do not face a financial squeeze before the end of the current fiscal year in march, according to sources familiar with the central bank's thinking. european central bank the ecb, the central bank of the euro zone, has so far avoided cutting interest rates. policymakers did hold an unscheduled meeting on march 3 but it was to discuss operational responses to coronavirus, such as whether to hold events and staff shortages, rather than any policy response, sources close to the matter said. the ecb has asked euro zone banks to review their business continuity plans and the actions they can take to prepare for and minimize the potential adverse effects of the coronavirus, a letter seen by reuters shows. the european union european union leaders have so far failed to agree radical measures to tackle the crisis. the head of the bloc's executive ursula von der leyen said the european commission will set up a joint investment fund with firepower of 25 billion euros ($28 billion) from existing resources to cushion the blow to vulnerable sectors of the bloc's economies. germany germany's centre-left coalition agreed to increase public investments by 12.4 billion euros by 2024 and to make it easier for companies to claim subsidies to support workers on reduced working hours to counter the effects of the coronavirus epidemic. chancellor angela merkel's conservatives are split over whether germany should rush out a fiscal stimulus package to counter any impact of the coronavirus on europe's largest economy. budget experts estimate the government has the fiscal room for additional measures worth at least 17 billion euros ($18.9 billion). some officials say that berlin could even put together a \nstimulus package worth up to 50 billion euros, without ditching the government's policy of no new debt. britain britain launched a 30 billion-pound ($39 billion) economic stimulus plan just hours after the bank of england slashed interest rates, a double-barrelled package aimed at warding off the risk of a coronavirus recession. the bank of england cut interest rates by half a percentage point and offered banks cheaper funding and a reduction in capital buffers in an emergency move to bolster britain's economy against disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak. france french finance minister bruno le marie has said that europe needs to be ready to use fiscal stimulus to deal with the impact of the coronavirus. the government is allowing companies to suspend payments of some social charges and taxes, and is activating state-subsidised short-time work schemes. it has ordered the bpifrance state investment bank to guarantee loans needed to overcome short-term cashflow problems. paris has also allowed companies to declare force majeure due to the outbreak if they cannot honor a contract with the public sector, and is putting pressure on big companies to show similar leniency with subcontractors. india the reserve bank of india (rbi) plans to infuse fresh cash liquidity into the system through a second round of long-term repo operations (ltro), government officials told reuters, amid fears that the coronavirus outbreak will derail any revival of economic growth. one official said the rbi might inject as much as 1 trillion rupees ($13.6 billion) in the round that will begin as early as april. the rbi has said it stands ready to act to maintain market confidence and preserve financial stability. the government is, meanwhile, pushing state-run banks to approve new loans amounting to 500-600 billion rupees by the end of march, according to government sources. italy italy has doubled the amount it plans to spend on tackling its coronavirus outbreak to 7.5 billion euros \n($8.4 billion) and is raising this year's deficit goal to 2.5% of national output from the current 2.2% target. payments on mortgages will be suspended across the whole of italy and italy's banking lobby abi said lenders would offer debt moratoriums to small firms and households grappling with the economic fallout from the virus. canada finance minister bill morneau said on march 9 that the government was \"looking at taking some initiatives this week,\" as canada reported its first coronavirus death, with a steep decline in oil prices expected to hit the world's fourth-largest crude producer hard. the bank of canada lowered its benchmark overnight rate to 1.25% from 1.75% in response to the epidemic, prompting money markets to price in a better-than-even chance of another reduction next month. the last time it cut by 50 basis points was in 2009 during the financial crisis. south korea the government announced a stimulus package of 11.7 trillion won ($9.8 billion) to cushion the impact of the largest outbreak of coronavirus outside china. finance minister hong nam-ki said the supplementary budget, subject to parliamentary approval, would channel money to the health system, childcare, and outdoor markets. an additional 10.3 trillion won in treasury bonds will be issued this year to fund the extra budget. seoul has also dramatically tightened rules on short-selling for three months. starting march 11, stocks with a sudden and abnormal increase in short-selling transactions will be suspended from

malaysia more prepared to deal with such situations, and this included having more thermal scanners which have been placed at all entry points into the country, as well as its actions in isolating coronavirus cases and placing suspected cases under quarantine.he said swift measures such as these were important in reducing potential local transmissions of the virus in the country.\"compared to sars in 2002, when we took weeks to trace the infections, now we have managed to do so much earlier due to our experience, expertise and the technology employed.\"we are now in a containment phase, to prevent any local transmission. the seven cases that have been detected were not infected in malaysia but overseas, and imported into the country. it is important that we prevent the infections from spreading within the country,\" dr lee explained.the new coronavirus, named 2019-ncov, was first detected in december, in wuhan, china, causing pneumonia and symptoms such as fever, cough and breathing difficulties. as of last night, malaysia had seven confirmed cases.the specialist added that apart from thermal scanners, the dissemination of information to every tourist entering malaysia,

the future of covid-19 in india? for how long coronavirus will infect people here? how many people are going to fall sick with covid-19 in india? and how many people may die of covid-19 here? no one has a sure answer to these questions. possibly because no one can have an answer to these questions. but in case you are curious there is an online tool created by a machine learning expert that shows the course covid-19 pandemic may take in india. it is a simple tool, but one based on seir model that scientists and public health experts use to predict epidemic in a given region. the tool has been created by gabriel goh, a machine learning researcher. there is nothing official about the tool but during a time when the information from government experts may not be coming or coming fast enough it can shed some clarity on what covid-19 can do to india. depending on what measures the country takes, and what impact these measures have on covid-19 infections in india, coronavirus may end up killing around 1000 people to 5 million people in india, according to the epidemic calculator. why such gap between these two numbers? according to the epidemic calculator, it all depends on flattening the curve, bringing down r0 the rate at which infections spread and at what stage the lockdown was enforced and ordered. at the time of writing, the coronavirus disease of 2019 remains a global health crisis of grave and uncertain magnitude. to the non-expert (such as myself), contextualizing the numbers, forecasts and epidemiological parameters described in the media and literature can be challenging. i created this calculator as an attempt to address this gap in understanding, notes goh. this calculator implements a classical infectious disease model -- seir (susceptible > exposed > infected > removed) -- an idealized model of spread still used in frontlines of \nresearch. by default the tool already has the relevant data, based on the research reports that have come out on covid-19 from china and other countries so far, in the required fields. to see how covid-19 will progress in india on the basis of this available data about coronavirus, and how it infects people, how many it kills, for how long it keeps people sick, all you need to do is change the population of the region to india\u2019s population. here are some projections this tool gives as far covid-19 and its future progression in india is concerned: covid-19 in india with default data with default data, which considers the infection rate r0 of 2.2 it means a coronavirus patient is likely to infect at least two more people the coronavirus epidemic calculator indicates that in a year the disease will infect a little over 1 million people in india. of these, it will kill little over 20,000 people. while you look at these numbers, there are a few important bits to remember. -- by default the epidemic calculator assumes that on the 100th day after the first reported case the government has forced the region or country into a full lockdown. -- the lockdown or intervention in some other way, brings down the r0 to less than 1. this is very important. -- if the lockdown or intervention has brought the r0 lower earlier, say just 50 days after the first case was reported, the total number of cases will be significantly less and number of fatalities exponentially lower. -- it is also important to remember that by default the epidemic calculator considers fatality rate for covid-19 as 2 per cent. in china, it has been slightly more. in south korea and germany it is significantly less. in italy and spain, it is alarmingly high, particularly in italy where it is above 8 per cent. if you consider other figures for india depending on which one you do the covid-19 picture will change. the covid-19 case fatality rate for india is something neither experts nor epidemic calculator can \npredict. the global fatality rate for swine flu is less than 0.1 per cent. but in india, in the previous swine flu epidemics, the death rate has been close to 6 per cent. for covid-19 only time will tell what is the fatality rate in india. covid-19 in india a best case scenario so, what is the best case scenario for covid-19 in india. if everything works well in india, if government mounts a good response, and death rate is not above 2 per cent, health care system holds up, quarantine is effective, then covid-19 may end up infecting a little above 15,000 people. this also takes into account the fact that in india the first case was detected on january 30 and the lockdown was ordered on march 24. assuming that the coronavirus became infectious in india a few days before the first patient was detected, we can say that the country mounted effective response on around day 65 of the disease. this can potentially limit number of ccovid-19 cases in india to around 15,000 and deaths to around 300. let's hope this is the case. covid-19 in india worst case scenario now, take the worst case scenario. this is the one where the data that we have so far from the government is not accurate, the quarantine is not effective, the health system is not ready and will not be able to hold up well, that the disease is spreading in india undetected for far longer even though the first case was only found on january 30. in this case, also assume that india\u2019s poor health system will not be able to cope up with covid-19 when cases start to rise and let\u2019s move the case fatality rate to 4 per cent, which is still significantly lower than what covid-19 is showing in italy and spain but is higher than the global rate. let\u2019s also assume that the quarantine doesn\u2019t bring down the r0 much. may be a half per cent or so but not enough to flatten the curve in one year. in this case, given that population of india is little over 1.3 billion, we may end up seeing around 180 million infected in the \ncountry this year and little over 5 million dead. this is all projection it\u2019s important to note that covid-19 epidemic calculator is a tool that creates projections on the basis of data you feed into it. and as far as covid-19 and novel coronavirus are concerned, right now not enough data, and not accurate enough data, is available. everything is an approximation. what is the real fatality rate of covid-19? different countries are showing different numbers and they are all over the place, with extremely huge gaps between them. how quickly and how widely this is r0 that covid-19 spreads? again, we don\u2019t know the exact number. some studies say it is 4. some say it is 2. some even say that it is 6. then there are other unknowns. can covid-19 re-infect people who were sick with it and then got better? we don\u2019t know for sure. does temperature india is a very hot country and dry air summer is coming in parts of india affect this coronavirus? and if it does, how much? we don\u2019t know for sure. there are many more factors, like real world conditions. how long covid-19 patients take to recover? for how long they are infectious? for how long they have to be in a hospital? for how long a country can care for its icu patients? these are the figures that government experts and policy makers probably know. an online epidemic calculator doesn\u2019t. so if you are giving the online epidemic calculator created by gabriel goh a spin, keep this in mind. "}, {"content": "China prohibits trading with wild animals by Wuhan Coronavirus. It was enough to use some keywords: \"Hunting\", \"wild flavor\", or \"totally natural\". On some most popular Chinese e-commerce platforms until now it was possible to find, investigating a little, the most exotic meats. Like the civet, the feline who served as a transmitter to human beings of the SARS-causing virus in 2003, at 350 yuan (46 euros) kilo. or peacock. o Giant salamanders. It is no longer as easy, at least for a while. As a result of the new Coronavirus of Wuhan, transmitted to human beings by an animal sold in one of the markets of that city, the Chinese government has just prohibited - although at the moment, only provisionally - the trade and transportation of wild species. The joint order issued by three official entities, including the Ministry of Agriculture prohibits any type of trade with these animals, alive or dead, on any platform, although it specifically mentions electronic commerce, restaurants, supermarkets or markets. Local authorities will increase inspections and punishments to those who violate the prohibition will be \"severe\". The breeding farms of these animals will be quarantine. \"Consumers must fully understand the health risks of eating wild animals, they have to stay away from the wild flavor and eat healthy,\" says the norm. The passage has occurred after scientists trace the origin of the new Coronavirus, which has caused the death of at least 56 people and infected more than 2,000 only in China - and more than thirty in the rest of the world - to a Market in the city of Wuhan, the epicenter of infection. Although theoretically the market Huanan-well closed at Cal and singing - was dedicated to the sale of seafood and fish, all kinds of caged animals were also sold. A price list that has circulated by social networks included a \nA hundred species, from wolf cubs or camel meat. Also marmots, foxes or monkeys. or snakes, mice, cats and dogs. Scientists have not managed to safely identify the species, but they have determined that Coronavirus 2019-NECOG passed to humans through an animal. A group of Chinese scientists has published that it was probably a snake; Others consider that it could be a bat. A situation identical to which triggered the SARS epidemic in 2003: scientists determined that the transmitter of that coronavirus -remparmed with that of Wuhan-had been civetic meat sold in a canton market. That focus ended up infecting 8,422 people and causing death to almost 800. Then, as now, trade with wild animals was banned. But, as now, temporarily. The interest in the consumption of these meats also decreased. But temporarily. China remains a voracious consumer of wild animal products, to the point of increasing the risk of extinction of some species. The demand, either as food or for its use in traditional medicine, has grown in parallel with the prosperity of the country. Among certain sectors, eating meats the more exotic and difficult to obtain Sean is a way to exhibit social position. In other cases, such as dog consumption at the Yulin Festival, in the south, eating that meat is almost an act of claiming supposed national roots. Markets like Wuhan's are not rare. An investigation that the Beijing News newspaper published last week found that, a month after the first contagions were detected in Wuhan, it was still possible in different provinces markets willing to sell, restaurants willing to prepare and, in Internet forums, consumers willing to pay what it was necessary for this type of food. the problem in those markets are not only the conditions of hygiene in which \nKeep animals, often deficient. Also the difficulty of establishing the origin of the copies. Although there are farms that are dedicated to the breeding of these species with a license - it is estimated that those of Tigre welcome some 6,000 copies - activists denounce that it is not infrequent that wild animals captured end up in any of them; or that the licenses have been obtained illegally. Although the virulence of Wuhan Coronavirus outbreak has made the voices against these practices multiply. Last week, 19 prominent scientists sent an open letter to the government to request the limitation of that trade. \"It is not only important for ecological conservation, but because of its great importance to control public health risks,\" they Alertaban. Experts also request that \"legal gaps\" be resolved in permits for domestication and breeding wild animals, which allow traffickers to hunt animals released and sell them in the market through farms. \"The viruses transmitted by animals are human pathogens that appear more frequently. They represent less than 15% of all known species of human pathogens, but more than 65% of discovered pathogens since 1980, \"says Christian Walzer's statement, the Executive Director of the NGO Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), based in New York The consumption of wild meat has also been on debate on Chinese networks. \"If humans do not live in harmony with nature, of course nature is going to return the blow!\", Commented a Weibo user, Chinese Twitter. At the moment, the prohibition that arrives from Beijing is only temporary. The order issued this Sunday requires that it will last only \"until the epidemic situation throughout the country disappears.\" Organizations such as WCS claim that it be permanent. Not only in China, but throughout the world. \"If those markets continue, and consumption \nHuman wild animals illegal and without reglar continues, the public will continue to face greater risks of new viruses, potentially more lethal and sources of future pandemics, \"Walzer says.

Then it was found that, per person, the rate of transmission of undocumented infections was 55% in relation to documented infections. and non-detected cases were even the source of the infection of 79% of the detected cases.\nFinally, it is stressed that the drastic measures of the Chinese government and the understanding of people reduced the rate of spread of the virus in China.

Exempted from the prohibition, Australian citizens and people with permanent residence permit and their relatives, said Prime Minister Scott Morrison. The Foreign Ministry has exacerbated its travel instructions for China and recommends australians now to give up traveling to China. The ban on entry is now implemented by the border authorities, announced Morrison. The travelers exempt from the ban would have to go to the country in their return to a two-week \"self-quarantine\", he said. This means that Morisson follows the example of the US government, which had already imposed a similar entry ban a day before. The exceptions to the US ban are the same as the Australian regulation, also the USA gave a travel warning. The Chinese government had criticized the US because of the travel ban. She witness \"certainly not of goodwill,\" said a speaker of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. While the World Health Organization (WHO) had advised by travel restrictions, the US would have \"overruned the opposite way\". The \"words and actions of certain US representatives\" do not correspond to the facts or be \"reasonable\". Criticism had also confessed US commercial minister Wilbur Ross. As the New York Times reports, he said in an interview with the sender Fox Business, the outbreak of the virus could help to relocate jobs in China back to the United States. Companies would need to comply with the virus when planning their supply chains. The WHO had proclaimed the international health nightstand because of the virus. Connected, above all, is the publication of concrete recommendations for action to all countries to curb the virus. WHO General Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had at the \nAnnouncement of the decision emphasized, it is not a \"mistrust vote\" against China. Travel and trade restrictions are not necessary. At the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities of the World Health Organization WHO reported an accumulation of pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause in the Central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the diseases. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days then a group released a group of the virologen Christian's premier from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 the first diagnostic test for the new virus, the researcher provisionally call 2019-NCOV. With the test, the virus can be detected in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, on which, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected. Both the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as well as Mers (MIDDLE East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses which have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more than 750 died. With the MERS virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronaviruses. Many of them relate to respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example. In China, several thousand persons are suffering from them, some of them - most of them with pre-existing conditions - have died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first infection cases outside of China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been in Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist, who from Wuhan \nCamus, on January 24, the first cases were known in France. Meanwhile, first cases were confirmed in Germany. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. The virus can cause pneumonia that can endally end. Since it is a viral illness, antibiotics do not help. Meanwhile, it is clear that the virus can be transferred from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transfers after a dozen cases were known in medical staff. Medizors assume that the virus is transmitted above all over droplet infection. The World Health Organization calculates, as announced on January 24, at the moment that an infected one cuts 1.4 to 2.5 other people. Contest these numbers, the virus is less contagious than SARS and also the viral flu. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals. That can not be said yet. The World Health Organization said on 28 January that about one-fifth of the reported cases through the virus will be seriously ill, so in case of doubt must be treated intensive care. According to reports, the first death pots were patients who had some severe pre-existing conditions. Even with other infectious diseases, people with pre-existing diseases are particularly endangered - for example at the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so change their genome. This can cause you to become more dangerous for people in the course of an outbreak - but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) expects no similar mortality to the current time as the outbreak of SARS. Australia had the first last Saturday \nThree coronaviruses reported, meanwhile, the number of infected in the country is nine. In total, just under 12,000 cases have been registered worldwide.

At least six of them are in good condition according to doctors, for a case there has been no information yet.

Already in Italy, the greatest European focus of the new disease, only last weekend the affluence to the Italian cinemas fell 75% in relation to the same weekend of 2019, for example. This week in Italy there are about 850 screens without working - the total in the country is 1830, recalls Variety. The premiences of some American films were postponed. Also in China the premises of Americans for the next few weeks and months are suspended: Mulan's debuts were postponed, 007: No time to die, Dolittle, 191, Jojo Rabbit, Sonic the film; In South Korea, the premiere of Bora there, from Pixar, is also undatected.

wuhan virus but more research needed. pittsburg, pennsylvania: snakes \u2013 the chinese krait and the chinese cobra \u2013 may be the original source of the newly discovered coronavirus that has triggered an outbreak of a deadly infectious respiratory illness in china this winter.   the illness was first reported in late december 2019 in wuhan, a major city in central china, and has been rapidly spreading. since then, sick travelers from wuhan have infected people in china and other countries, including the united states.   using samples of the virus isolated from patients, scientists in china have determined the genetic code of the virus and used microscopes to photograph it. the pathogen responsible for this pandemic is a new coronavirus.   it\u2019s in the same family of viruses as the well-known severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers), which have killed hundreds of people in the past 17 years.   the world health organization (who) has named the new coronavirus 2019-ncov.\u00a0but there are many questions that need to be answered to curb the spread of this public health threat.   the deadly wuhan coronavirus   the name of coronavirus comes from its shape, which resembles a crown or solar corona when imaged using an electron microscope.   coronavirus is transmitted through the air and primarily infects the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract of mammals and birds.   though most of the members of the coronavirus family only cause mild flu-like symptoms during infection, sars and mers can infect both upper and lower airways and cause severe respiratory illness and other complications in humans.      this new 2019-ncov causes similar symptoms to sars and mers. people infected with these coronaviruses suffer a severe inflammatory response.   unfortunately, there is no approved vaccine or antiviral treatment available for coronavirus infection.   a better understanding of \nthe life cycle of 2019-ncov, including the source of the virus, how it is transmitted and how it replicates are needed to both prevent and treat the disease.   the problem with zoonotic transmissions   both sars and mers are classified as zoonotic viral diseases, meaning the first patients who were infected acquired these viruses directly from animals.   this was possible because while in the animal host, the virus had acquired a series of genetic mutations that allowed it to infect and multiply inside humans.   now these viruses can be transmitted from person to person.   field studies have revealed that the original source of sars and mers is the bat, and that the masked palm civets (a mammal native to asia and africa) and camels, respectively, served as intermediate hosts between bats and humans.   in the case of this 2019 coronavirus outbreak, reports state that most of the first group of patients hospitalised were workers or customers at a local seafood wholesale market which also sold processed meats and live consumable animals including poultry, donkeys, sheep, pigs, camels, foxes, badgers, bamboo rats, hedgehogs and reptiles.      however, since no one has ever reported finding a coronavirus infecting aquatic animals, it is plausible that the coronavirus may have originated from other animals sold in that market.   the hypothesis that the 2019-ncov jumped from an animal at the market is strongly supported by a new publication in the journal of medical virology. the scientists conducted an analysis and compared the genetic sequences of 2019-ncov and all other known coronaviruses.   the study of the genetic code of 2019-ncov reveals that the new virus is most closely related to two bat sars-like coronavirus samples from china, initially suggesting that, like sars and mers, the bat might also be the origin of 2019-ncov.   the authors further found that the rna coding sequence of 2019-ncov spike protein, which forms the \u201ccrown\u201d of the virus particle that \nrecognises the receptor on a host cell, indicates that the bat virus might have mutated before infecting people.   but when the researchers performed a more detailed bioinformatics analysis of the sequence of 2019-ncov, it suggests that this coronavirus might come from snakes.   from bats to snakes   the researchers used an analysis of the protein codes favoured by the new coronavirus and compared it to the protein codes from coronaviruses found in different animal hosts, like birds, snakes, marmots, hedgehogs, manis, bats and humans.   surprisingly, they found that the protein codes in the 2019-ncov are most similar to those used in snakes.   snakes often hunt for bats in wild.   reports indicate that snakes were sold in the local seafood market in wuhan, raising the possibility that the 2019-ncov might have jumped from the host species \u2013 bats \u2013 to snakes and then to humans at the beginning of this coronavirus outbreak.   however, how the virus could adapt to both the cold-blooded and warm-blooded hosts remains a mystery.   the authors of the report and other researchers must verify the origin of the virus through laboratory experiments. searching for the 2019-ncov sequence in snakes would be the first thing to do.      however, since the outbreak, the seafood market has been disinfected and shut down, which makes it challenging to trace the new virus\u2019 source animal.   sampling rna from animals sold at the market and from wild snakes and bats is needed to confirm the origin of the virus. nonetheless, the reported findings will also provide insights for developing prevention and treatment protocols.   the 2019-ncov outbreak is another reminder that people should limit the consumption of wild animals to prevent zoonotic infections.   follow us on telegram for the latest updates: https://cna.asia/telegram   haitao guo is professor of microbiology and molecular genetics at the university of pittsburgh. shou-jiang gao

How do you know in the event that the pulmonary infection from China will also become an epidemic in Europe? The boss of the British Wellcome Trust, the world's two-riding foundation for the promotion of medical research, tweeted a few days ago: \"One thing that would help is to vaccinate against flu.\" First of all, that seems strange. Because a flu prototype does not protect against infection with the virus called 2019-NCOV, which spreads from the city of Wuhan since the turn of the year in China and across country borders. Located it has already been introduced to Europe. Also in Germany, a person has become infected with the pathogen. The idea behind the call of Jeremy Farrar for flu vaccine was another: because the symptoms of a real flu (see box) and the lung disease triggered by the coronavirus may be similar at the beginning, influenza patients would quickly become corona in case of doubt. Suspected cases. with all the consequences that would have that. Also, they would then have to be isolated and tested for the pathogen they infected them. Last but not least, those affected would be offset in fear and terror. In this respect, milling vaccinations mitigued the pressure on the health system, which the new pathogens could develop, he should also lead to an epidemic. In short, the milder the flu, the fewer additional problems would have epidemics. The flu, caused by the influenza virus, usually starts suddenly with fever, dry irritant cough, muscle and / or headache. Other symptoms can be general weakness, sweat eruptions, but also nausea / vomiting and diarrhea. The disease period is usually five to seven days. The current flu in Germany can be found on the website of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Influenza \nsee. By far, not all influenza infected illicit so typical. Depending on the severity of the flu sail, a few hundreds of up to more than 20,000 people die each year in this country (source: Robert Koch-Institut) a contagion is predominantly due to droplets, as they are especially in coughing or sneezing. They reach a low distance on the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract of healthy people. In addition, a transmission is also possible via hands and surfaces, which are contaminated by virus-containing secretions. The Standing Vaccination Commission (Stiko) of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) recommends influential vaccination for all persons from 60 years, all pregnant women with increased health risk (eg individuals with chronic diseases of respiratory organs, cardiovascular diseases, liver or Kidney diseases, diabetes or other metabolic diseases, multiple sclerosis, congenital or acquired immunodeficiency) as well as for residents of age or nursing homes. In addition, persons with increased threatening (e.g., medical personnel) and persons should be vaccinated, which could infect risk officers supervised by them. Likewise, people should be vaccinated with direct contact with poultry and wild birds (the vaccine does not protect against bird flu, but there are problematic double infections avoided). Similarly, it sees the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), even though its President Lothar Wieler the recommendation to vaccinate against flu, at a press appearance with Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU) on Tuesday, limited to special risk groups. Those for which the Standing Vaccination Commission (Stiko) of his Institute recommends a flu for a flu in anyway, they should now also perceive them, he said. This refers to people from 60 years, pregnant, chronically ill and employees as well as inhabitants of Alten- or \nNursing homes as well as persons with greatly increased risk, and others with an influenza - ie, for example, medical staff or people in facilities with a lot of crowd traffic. The RKI gets support from politicians. \"A flu vaccine always makes sense, which is now right now,\" said Health Policy Deputy Group Chairman of the Union, Georg N\u00fcselein (CSU) in conversation with time online. Whether the Stiko is therefore due to their vaccination recommendations on all citizens and citizens, the professionals would have to decide for themselves. \"We currently have no reason for compulsory measures or interventions of any kind. There is no reason to panic,\" emphasized N\u00fc\u00dflein. In particular, the domestic courses should now be increasingly pointing to patients to the flu. \"This also serves the sense of security and the well-being of the people,\" said N\u00fc\u00dflein. At the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities of the World Health Organization WHO reported an accumulation of pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause in the Central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the diseases. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days then a group released a group of the virologen Christian's premier from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 the first diagnostic test for the new virus, the researcher provisionally call 2019-NCOV. With the test, the virus can be detected in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, on which, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected. Both the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as well as Mers (MIDDLE East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses which have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic \nInflected in 2002 and 2003 about 8,000 people, more than 750 died. With the MERS virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronaviruses. Many of them relate to respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example. In China, several thousand persons are suffering from them, some of them - most of them with pre-existing conditions - have died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first infection cases outside of China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been in Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection with a tourist, who came back from Wuhan, on January 24, the first cases were known in France. Meanwhile, first cases were confirmed in Germany. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. The virus can cause pneumonia that can endally end. Since it is a viral illness, antibiotics do not help. Meanwhile, it is clear that the virus can be transferred from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transfers after a dozen cases were known in medical staff. Medizors assume that the virus is transmitted above all over droplet infection. The World Health Organization calculates, as announced on January 24, at the moment that an infected one cuts 1.4 to 2.5 other people. Contest these numbers, the virus is less contagious than SARS and also the viral flu. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals. That can not be said yet. the \nWorld Health Organization said on January 28, that about a fifth of the reported cases by the virus will be seriously ill, so in case of doubt must be treated intensive care. According to reports, the first death pots were patients who had some severe pre-existing conditions. Even with other infectious diseases, people with pre-existing diseases are particularly endangered - for example at the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so change their genome. This can cause you to become more dangerous for people in the course of an outbreak - but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) expects no similar mortality to the current time as the outbreak of SARS. Similarly, it sees his SPD colleague, faction province B\u00e4rbel Bas. \"A flu vaccine makes sense. In my view, more people should vaccinate,\" she said online. However, the politician does not see a reason to extend the flu vaccination recommendation. The effort to test a person with suspicion of a coronavirus infection is manageable: \"If symptoms are available to the coronavirus infection and the person concerned has been in a risk area in China in the last 14 days or had contact with a diseased person, Then this person is tested in compliance with hygienic measures such as a mouth-nose protection on the coronavirus, \"said BAS. A test then deliver a result in a few hours and is also sufficiently available in Germany. The test could also make people who were Hubei in the Chinese province - from their capital Wuhan, the pathogen had continued to spread in January - or had contact with a detected infected person, even if they had no symptoms yet. Generally, according to physicians, the best time is to vaccinate in the October or November, so before the influenza time begins. but also \nNow a vaccine may still be useful, Stressed RKI President Wieler. The time after the turn of the year is generally considered the one in which very many flu infections are recorded. However, until the vaccine can deploy your protective effect, it will take ten to 14 days. Of course, people who do not belong to the risk groups can be vaccinated. Many health insurance companies - including the three largest, namely technician health insurance (TK), German employed health insurance (DAK) and the Barmer Replacement Fund (Bek) take over the costs for all insured persons who wish for. For healthy young people, the vaccine reduces the risk of falling to flu 80 percent, in older people, which vaccine is particularly recommended for the statistically higher death risk through the infection, it is still 41 to 63 percent. According to the researchers at the RKI, despite moderate vaccine rates, the 400,000 influenza diseases are prevented annually by the 400,000 influenza diseases in the over 60 years. Depending on the severity of the flu seam and type of pathogen - which converts each year, which is why the vaccine must always be further developed and re-administered annually - die in this country between a few hundred and more than 20,000 people per year at a flu. 2017/18 it was even 25,100. Anyone who wants to protect themselves and others in front of a contagion, for the RKI vice-President Lars Schaade also beyond vaccinations still a few practical tips: in the elbow sneezing, often washing the hands, keeping a distance to people who are cold. \"This protects against influenza and also applies, we should get more cases of the new coronavirus in Germany.\" Read more about the new coronavirus here.

"}, {"content": "Spanish hospitals are anticipated at the arrival of the Coronavirus. Form the emergency personnel and equip themselves with tools for rapid diagnosis of patients who can enter with the Wuhan Coronavirus. Thus, the large Spanish hospitals are prepared at the outbreak that stalks to China and that has reached nine other countries aboard international flights. It is not for now the case of Spain: The Ministry of Health reported this Friday that two cases suspected under study, people with respiratory ailments recently arrived from Wuhan, have given negative to the tests carried out. But at the last minute the Basque Country notified that they had a patient with some suspicious symptoms that she was under surveillance and that she had recently visited Wuhan. \"We are following everything with great interest, but also with tranquility. It is very unlikely that the new virus will become a relevant problem in Spain, \"says Santiago Moreno, head of the Service of Infectious Diseases of Ram\u00f3n and Cajal Hospital (Madrid). This position coincides with that maintained by the ministry. \"The population has to have a very low risk perception level,\" said Fernando Simon, director of the Health Alerts and Emergencies Coordination Center, in the presentation of measures agreed for health and autonomous communities. Three ideas are the most repeated by the specialists consulted by this newspaper. The first is that what is known about the virus is still little. \"We do not know the transmissibility rate, which tells us how many people contagiate each case. Nor do we know if there are asymptomatic cases or with very mild symptoms, \"explains Jes\u00fas Rodr\u00edguez Bath, head of the Service of Infectious Diseases of the Virgin Macarena Hospital (Seville). The second is that, with the available data, Wuhan seems less virulent than the other Coronavirus who have caused epidemic outbreaks since 2002. \"Mortality does not reach 5%, while with the \nsars and mers were much higher [10% and 35%, respectively], \"says Juan Carlos Galan, spokesman for the Spanish society of infectious diseases and microbiology (SEIMC). In addition, \"although it has been demonstrated transmission from person to person, does not seem very high, less than the sars\" says Magda Campins, chief of preventive medicine at the Hospital Vall d'Hebron (Barcelona). as a third important idea, experts conclude that, until the investigations progress and international agencies establish more precise recommendations, it is advisable to \"adopt here the necessary steps to be prepared if a case goes,\" said Jos\u00e9 Cisneros Miguel, head of service infectious diseases hospital virgin dew. \"And rest assured, because our public health system and our hospitals are amply prepared to deal with an episode like this,\" he adds. the first steps taken by hospitals are to \"prepare protocols for emergency personnel, which is the gateway to the hospital,\" says Campins. \"The goal is to determine if the patient suffers symptoms consistent with the virus and if she has recently traveled to Wuhan,\" she adds. If two events coincide, \"the patient should be admitted in isolation and medical personnel take precautionary measures usual until you discard or confirm that the disease is caused by the virus,\" says Rodriguez bathroom. These measures go through \"hand protection and respiratory barriers, such as masks high degree of protection in case there airborne,\" she adds. the instructions are finalizing the Ministry of Health and the Autonomous Communities establish that samples of all suspected patients will be sent to the National Microbiology Center (CNM), which will be the reference and have the results in about a day. but large hospitals have a technology called PCR, \nIt allows to advance the diagnosis in very few hours. \"We are acquiring the specific kits to genetically identify the Wuhan virus with the PCR,\" Campins account. \"We have ordered the purchase and we will arrive on Monday,\" explain from Ram\u00f3n and Cajal. Fernando Simon explained Friday that if a positive case is detected, contact tracking will be monitored, although the virus does not have \"a lot of transmissibility\". On a flight, for example, the evolution of the two passengers seated at his side would be followed. The objective is that the public network has the sensitivity to detect cases without blocking the health system. Health does not arise for now taking exceptional measures at airports, since there are no direct flights from Wuhan and is a measure \"that has not been utilized\", according to Simon. This explained that it is very frequent that passengers who come from long flights suffer respiratory symptoms, more in winter, so applying controls to arrivals \"would not contribute a sufficient benefit.\" Health concludes that \"it is not very likely, but it can happen\" that the virus arrives in Spain. \"That is why we are prepared to act,\" explained Simon, who recalled that the most important thing in these outbreaks are the performances in origin and that he considers that quarantines in China reduce risk. "}, {"content": "chinese president xi jinping, under fire, says he led covid-19 fight early on. beijing \u2014 under fire for its response to the coronavirus epidemic, china\u2019s authoritarian government appears to be pushing a new account of events that presents president xi jinping as taking early action to fight the outbreak that has convulsed the country.   but in doing so, authorities have acknowledged for the first time that mr xi was aware of the epidemic and involved in the response nearly two weeks before he first spoke publicly about it \u2014 and while officials at its epicentre in the city of wuhan were still playing down its dangers.   that new account risks drawing the president, china\u2019s most powerful leader in decades, directly into questions about whether top officials did too little, too late.   in an internal speech published saturday, mr xi said he had \u201cissued demands about the efforts to prevent and control\u201d the coronavirus jan 7, during a meeting of the politburo standing committee, the highest council of the communist party, whose sessions are typically cloaked in secrecy.   in the speech, he also said he had authorised the unprecedented lockdown of wuhan and other cities beginning jan 23.   \u201ci have at every moment monitored the spread of the epidemic and progress in efforts to curtail it, constantly issuing oral orders and also instructions,\u201d mr xi said of his more recent involvement.   mr xi\u2019s advisers may have hoped that publishing the speech, delivered feb 3, would dispel speculation about his recent retreat from public view and reassure his people that he can be trusted to lead them out of the epidemic. the virus so far has officially infected more than 68,000 people and killed more than 1,650 worldwide, the vast majority in mainland china.   \u201cthe overall tone of the speech appears to be defensive,\u201d said dr minxin pei, a professor of government at claremont mckenna college in california. \u201che wants to change the narrative, which until this point has been very \nunfavourable to the top leadership.\u201d   delivered at a meeting with top party officials, when the epidemic had already spiraled into a national crisis, the speech could expose mr xi to criticism that he didn\u2019t treat the initial threat urgently enough and make it difficult for him to shift blame onto local officials for what many see as the government\u2019s early mishandling of the epidemic.   the remarks also raise questions about what top leaders knew at the time and what instructions they issued based on that knowledge.   that mr xi convened a meeting of china\u2019s highest political body in early january indicates that the coronavirus was already being seen as a matter of high-level concern \u2014 making his subsequent silence even more conspicuous, experts said.   an official account of the jan 7 standing committee meeting issued at the time by xinhua, the state news agency, made no mention of a discussion of the coronavirus.   \u201cit seems like he\u2019s trying to indicate that \u2018we weren\u2019t asleep at the wheel,\u2019\u201d said dr jude blanchette, the freeman chair in china studies at the centre for strategic and international studies. \u201cbut it comes off like, \u2018we knew this was a problem, but we weren\u2019t sounding the alarm.\u2019\u201d   in the speech this month, mr xi signaled his displeasure with lower-level bureaucrats for their \u201cshortcomings\u201d in implementing the party\u2019s top-level directives.   in early january, officials in wuhan were giving open assurances that human-to-human transmission of the virus was unlikely. some government experts agreed.   \u201cfor now, it seems there is no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission,\u201d dr xu jianguo, a senior expert on communicable diseases at the chinese centre for disease control and prevention, said in an interview in early january with ta kung pao, a hong kong newspaper. \u201cthis shows that the threat level from this virus is limited.\u201d   the new information places mr xi\u2019s involvement in fighting the epidemic much earlier than was previously known. his \nearliest public comment on the epidemic came jan 20, when he gave brief instructions that were published in state media.   in the days after mr xi\u2019s jan 7 orders were issued, politicians in wuhan met for the annual meeting of the city\u2019s people\u2019s congress, its party-controlled legislature. over that time, the wuhan health commission\u2019s daily bulletins on the outbreak said repeatedly that there were no new cases of infection, no firm evidence of human-to-human transmission and no infection of medical workers.   but signs were growing that politicians and government experts underestimated the potency of the new coronavirus. on jan 9, a 61-year-old man surnamed zeng died \u2014 the earliest confirmed fatality from the virus. already, some doctors in wuhan hospitals were worried enough to warn friends and propose special wards for patients showing symptoms of infection.   even after mr xi made his first public remarks about the epidemic jan 20, he mostly kept it at the bottom of his public agenda. on the day before the chinese new year holiday began in late january, he took the stage at the great hall of the people in beijing and declared his success in guiding china through a difficult year \u2014 making no mention of the virus that was already spreading fear throughout the country.   in the days after, he all but disappeared from public view, emerging only a handful of times to preside over communist party meetings and to meet foreign visitors, including the director-general of the world health organization and cambodia\u2019s autocratic leader, mr hun sen.   in the meantime, he directed china\u2019s no. 2 leader, mr li keqiang, to lead the group handling the emergency, effectively turning him into the public face of the response.   for days, mr xi\u2019s absence from public view fueled speculation that he was trying to shield his own reputation by taking a back seat in the fast-unfolding crisis. in the past week, he has returned to centre stage in an apparent effort to swat away such talk. \nthis past week, mr xi went to a neighbourhood centre in beijing, a hospital and a centre for disease control in what state media billed as a visit to the \u201cfront line\u201d of china\u2019s efforts to combat the epidemic. he has yet to visit hubei, the province at the centre of the epidemic.   a few days later, mr xi fired two top communist party officials in hubei, a move intended to calm simmering public anger and contain the political fallout.   by publishing the feb 3 speech now, experts said, mr xi appears to be staking his reputation on the outcome of the epidemic fight.   \u201cwhat\u2019s really interesting in the speech is, there\u2019s a lot of the word \u2018i\u2019 in it,\u201d said dr blanchette, of centre for strategic and international studies. \u201cthis is clearly putting himself at the centre of beijing\u2019s response to this while also falling back on the old excuse of blaming cadres for long-standing pathologies of china\u2019s political system.\u201d   the feb 3 speech was published by qiushi, or seeking truth, the communist party\u2019s top doctrinal journal. it is rare for such an internal speech to be published in full so quickly. the new york times "}, {"content": "breakingviews - breakdown: coronavirus goes global. new york (reuters breakingviews) - it\u2019s not time to panic, but it is time to face reality. the coronavirus is spreading around the world. china\u2019s unprecedented efforts slowed the spread of the new disease officially known as covid-19, but that\u2019s merely won some time. infected people have now been detected on every continent except antarctica. competent and open government is the best defense against hospitals and society being overwhelmed. but nations will probably have to deal with recurring outbreaks. no. china helped reduce transmission by shutting down public gatherings, factories, and schools. mass testing is also key to figure out who has the disease, and track who may have been exposed. china now claims the number of new cases is falling. while the country\u2019s official statistics are notoriously unreliable, it makes sense such methods would slow the spread of the disease which has afflicted more than 78,000 people in the people\u2019s republic and killed around 2,700. while the world health organization has declined to call it a pandemic \u2013 a deadly disease which is spreading worldwide \u2013 the cat is out of the bag. cases have been found in 50 countries, and the list is rapidly growing. on wednesday the number of new cases reported outside china exceeded those inside the country for the first time since the disease was identified in early december. what\u2019s especially alarming is that one of the first indications of a mass outbreak in iran came from a traveler being diagnosed in canada. if countries that appear uninfected are spreading the disease, many other outbreaks are presumably underway. nearly every country neighboring iran has now been affected. for a disease to be truly worrisome, it needs to be both highly contagious and dangerous. ebola has caused a lot of suffering in central africa, but the disease often kills its victims before they can infect many others. the odds of it spreading widely are therefore low. \nby comparison the 2009 flu \u2013 the last pandemic \u2013 spread all over the earth but was surprisingly mild. america\u2019s centers for disease control estimates over 60 million americans were stricken. it swamped medical offices, workplaces were short-staffed, and schools emptied. but it only killed about one out of every 5,000 people who were infected. the new coronavirus appears to spread easily. the experience of the diamond princess cruise ship suggests it can be explosive. out of 3,700 passengers and crew, there have been about 700 confirmed cases and that number continues to rise. more broadly, cases outside china are more than doubling every week. it\u2019s also dangerous. the estimated death rate for covid-19 is about 2%, making it about 20 times deadlier than typical influenza. healthcare systems aren\u2019t designed to deal with pandemics, because they are so unusual. the united states has about 900,000 hospital beds, about two-thirds of which are occupied on average according to the cdc. the world health organization estimates about 80% of coronavirus cases are mild, with others serious or critical. so if just 1% of america\u2019s population of 330 million contracted the virus at the same time, there wouldn\u2019t be enough hospital beds. an uneven outbreak could lead to more overcrowding in some cities and critical-care units. hospitals would probably run short of protective gear. the u.s. department of health and human services has said the government has stockpiled 30 million masks, but it needs 300 million to protect front-line healthcare workers alone. doctors would be overloaded, because many would become sick, and because people who have not been infected would still seek help. stretched medical systems will kill more patients. this dynamic helps explain why the death rate in the city of wuhan, the center of the outbreak, has been higher than in other parts of china. countries with poor medical care will be hit harder. they lack the ability to find clusters of disease and dampen \nthe outbreak, while patients won\u2019t be treated. closed factories and housebound consumers have already depressed chinese economic activity. companies ranging from apple to yum china have warned of supply chain issues and decreased demand. these will cascade as more countries embrace drastic measures. japan on thursday closed all its schools early ahead of an upcoming spring break. it\u2019s notable that three of the four flu pandemics in the past century were followed shortly by u.s. recessions. the exception was the 2009 outbreak, which occurred when the world economy was already in the dumps. closed factories and offices reduce output, restaurants and cinemas suffer revenue shortfalls, corporate debt weighs heavier, while small businesses may fail if the owner falls sick or dies. the world bank estimated in 2014 that a pandemic of similar size and effect to the 1918 flu would knock 5% off global gross domestic product. that disease was both widespread and probably more virulent \u2013 it killed over 50 million people \u2013 so that\u2019s a worst-case scenario. allowing information to flow freely is the best way to identify clusters early. when local officials cover up, or doctors are afraid to disclose cases, outbreaks fester. the epidemics in china and iran probably would have been caught and acted upon earlier in less authoritarian countries. measures such as shutting down society or closing borders can slow transmission, but can\u2019t be sustained for months on end. democratic societies may not allow the kind of intensive surveillance china has practiced. workers and businesses can only go so long before the financial crunch becomes unbearable. china is now revving back up, and that will almost certainly result in more infections. mass testing of the exposed and isolating the sick can be sustained and might keep clusters manageable. but this requires a functioning system with competent leadership. south korea said on wednesday that over 20,000 people were being tested. the united \nstates has not started surveillance and has only been testing about a dozen people a day. that means undetected outbreaks are probably underway. past pandemics have spread in waves. the virus may propagate more effectively when the weather is cold and dry. behavior changes too; people wash their hands more often when evidence of sickness is around them. as the proportion of the population with immunity rises, the disease spreads more slowly. however, immunity may wane over time. the most likely outcome is that the disease becomes endemic with smaller outbreaks following the initial flare. several anti-viral medicines and vaccines are already being tested. showing efficacy, safety and scaling up production will take time, though. a drug to treat the coronavirus probably won\u2019t be widely available for at least a year; developing a vaccine will take longer. in the meantime, the world can only prepare for the worst, while hoping for the best.

In a press conference, the Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghreyesus stated that the outbreak that has already affected this Friday near 60 countries is increasing. With many questions yet unanswered, the main concern of the various countries is to try to brake the transmission of the virus and find a possible cure or specific treatment. Ghreyesus said it would be a \"big, big mistake\" to abandon the new coronavirus mitigation strategy, adding that each country must do \"aggressive containment.\" The WHO Director-General also advised that more than 20 vaccines are being developed and that there are already some clinical trials in accordance. Expect results in the coming weeks. 23 million extra budget Germany sums from the beginning of the crisis 48 cases (until this Friday), of which 18 have recovered. There was not until this afternoon record of deaths. The German Ministry of Health has on your site permanently updated information. A special budget was created to deal with the outbreak: EUR 23 million for measures to prevent, communication and repatriation of citizens, among others. In the field of prevention the rules are these: people who have been in countries or risk areas (the identification of the same fits, Germany, Robert Koch Institute) should avoid, \"regardless of whether they have symptoms,\" \"unnecessary\" contacts with Other people and should \"stay at home whenever possible\". Symptoms should be developed to go to the doctor, taking care to warn you before, by telephone, providing information on the visited countries, the ministry continues. Risk zones are considered: China, South Korea, Iran and Italy. Passengers coming from China, Hong Kong and Macau have, still on the plane, fill out a document with information on where they will stay in the 30 \nFollowing days in Germany, giving its contacts so that cases can be found some case among those who have traveled together. They also have to inform in which accurate sites were in China and in which health conditions are. All traveler information should be made available by airlines to the German health authorities. Airplane pilots have instructions for before landing communicate the health status of passengers. Some suspicious case should be communicated so that at the airport is a doctor who should enter the plane, examine the traveler concerned and decide what to do. The same rules should be applied to the trains and buses that cross terrestrial boundaries. Germany will \"continue to try to isolate people as much as possible treat them in clinics and provide care for possible contact people,\" said the Minister of Health, Jens Spahn. There have already been precautionary measures such as the closing of schools and day care centers in a city, Heinsberg, North Rhine-Westphalia, whose authorities ordered the domestic quarantine for all persons (between 300 and 400, according to the different media) that Participated in a carnival event this month. To these people can be requested samples of blood. This has been confirmed that a couple who has been to this party is infected. Other cases, 14 in total, confirmed on Thursday in Heinsberg, do not need hospitalization but remain isolated in their homes. People without symptoms should lead a \"normal life\" The Spanish Government recommends normal life for all people, even those returned from zones of risk. Spain recorded until 16:25 yesterday 34 positive cases, two of these have already been discharged. Only one 77-year-old man was in a serious condition. And even with these cases all confirmed, the recommendations are similar to those in Portugal. Whoever comes from risk areas, which Spain considers \nbe those of China Continental, Singapore, Hong-Kong, Japan, South Korea, Iran and Italy (Regions of Lombardy, Veneto, Emilia-Romana and Pijamonte) and is in good health should lead a \"normal, family life with friends and, in general, in the school space and work \". If in the 14 days after arrival they develop respiratory symptoms such as fever, coughing and sensation of lack of air, \"must remain at home and contact health services\" through the Spanish telephone line that exists for this purpose. Regarding trips to risk areas, the Spanish government recommends \"not traveling to the affected areas unless it is strictly necessary.\" There are no active quarantine measures in Spain at this time. There was a situation in a hotel in Tenerife where positive cases were identified, but these people have left the hotel and returned to their homes. The Spanish Public Health Department maintains the \"level a\" containment, of three possible levels. And it only ponders to raise this level, which can lead to more tight measures if there is an uncontrolled Community transmission. \"In this case, Spaniards will choose to choose \"Basic Social Distance Measures How to Reduce Agglomerations of People.\" But for already, this is only a hypothetical scenario. Thousands of quarantine the balance this Friday of the Italian Ministry of Health was this: 888 Infected so far, 21 dead, close to 50 people recovered. A special site was created where information about coronavirus is updated daily. There remains the decree of February 21 which commands, for example, that all people who have recently been In areas of China affected by the epidemic are forced to communicate this to the health authorities. It is also established that they should stay at home quarantine and that, in case of refusal, they will be \"ad opt measures with similar effectiveness. \" Since January 30 that are suspended Flights to Continental China, Macau, Hong Kong \nand Taiwan, by order of the Minister of Health. There are still specific measures in different regions. Since northern Italy has become the number one focus in Europe that the country has taken drastic measures. Eleven cities with a total of 55 thousand people are quarantined. Schools, universities and cinemas were closed and various public events canceled, such as the official festivities of the Venice Carnival or the Bologna Book Fair. The Italian region of Lombardy announced this Friday that will extend for another week the emergency measures adopted to try to contain the outbreak of the new coronavirus affecting the region - including the closing of schools and banning public gatherings. An inhabitant of San Fiorano, one of the quarantine cities, counted this Friday to the BBC that is no longer mandatory to use mask in supermarkets, that the situation is calm, but that the streets remain almost deserted. Volunteers guarantee the supply of food and medicines to older people (or patients) who can not leave home. to \"avoid the suspension\" of companies and production centers, the decree of February 21 allows companies and employees to opt for \"remote work\" until March 15 in six regions of northern Italy (but companies may reject the measure \" for organizational reasons \"). Italian public administration officials may also resort to this type of work. License for parents staying with children in France, precautionary measures included cancellation of events such as Nice Carnival and an international trade fair in Paris. The government decided to suspend all school trips to and from the zones where the virus circulates: China Continental, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, South Korea and the Italian regions of Lombardy and Veneto. Children and young people who return from these zones should not go to school for the next 14 days. Parents of these children will benefit from a 20-day paid license by means of a \nMedical certificate. In the case of adults workers, the government determines that during the 14 days subsequent to the return of risk zones these people work from home if they are in health. But if it is determined its isolation or if they have to remain at home, they immediately receive compensation for 20 working days. The French advise all people who return from risk zones to use a mask. The use of the mask is only recommended in these cases or if people are sick. At the Paris-Charles de Gaulle and Saint-Denis airports the passengers from China, Hong-Kong and Macao are greeted by a civil protection team that is in contact with the airport medical service concerned. Recommendations for those who are isolated at home About nine thousand people have been tested until this Friday in the UK, but only 20 cases were positive, according to the Ministry of Health in a release of this Friday. The government has warned for the hazards to react exaggeration in response to an epidemic and is increasing the number of tests even to people who have not traveled for risk zones in Italy, will or China, and who do not have symptoms. The official guidelines are for those who returned from 11 Italian cities quarantined is in isolation at home. The same applies to that the last days of Iran and certain areas of South Korea. Avoid contacting other people and phoning for the lines of the National Health Service are the recommendations. But measures such as the closure of borders are now removed. \"If you see the case of Italy, they stopped all flights from China and are now the most affected country in Europe,\" said Secretary of State for Health, Matt Hancock this week. Already who presents symptoms should remain at home, isolated while does not have the results of the exams. There are a number of recommendations for these people (for example, there are \nSpecials to have the domestic waste of these patients who must be properly packaged and not placed abroad to collect until there is certainty that the person is not infected; People should keep in a room with window to the outside and closed door ...). On 10 February the government announced the \"strengthening of legal powers to protect public health.\" And it is possible to order the isolation of individuals if there is reasoned reason for such. There are monitoring of passengers at airports (for those who come from China), a special team was placed at Heathrow Airport to support those who arrive and do not feel good, beyond the doctors who are permanently at all airports in the country.

"}, {"content": "novel coronavirus outbreak raises spectre of sars. many have drawn parallels between the current novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) epidemic and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) outbreak in 2002 and 2003.   it would be difficult not to.   both outbreaks are caused by novel animal coronaviruses that ended up infecting humans. both originated in china, can cause severe human disease and have resulted in deaths. both have been declared \u201cpublic health emergencies of international concern\u201d by the world health organization (who).   but there are significant differences between the two outbreaks and let\u2019s guard against seeing the 2019-ncov from an old lens.   first, let\u2019s consider why sars is deeply entrenched in many singaporeans\u2019 psyche.   the sars outbreak was a seminal event for singapore and its healthcare system in particular. while the 238 cases and 33 deaths here between march and july 2003 may seem small when compared to most other serious medical conditions, sars caused considerable fear and uncertainty among the people, with outsized economic and public health impact.   these include the ramifications from the closure of tan tock seng hospital \u2014\u00a0a large general hospital \u2014\u00a0to non-sars patients for almost three months.   then prime minister goh chok tong described the sars epidemic as a \u201cdefining moment\u201d for singapore.   while who had praised singapore for its exemplary handling of the epidemic, the outbreak also highlighted how unprepared our country was for a novel respiratory virus outbreak.   in its aftermath, fundamental changes to hospitals and outbreak management in our country were made that have been extensively described elsewhere.   as a result, singapore is now far more prepared for 2019-ncov and other epidemics compared to 2003.   the collective psychological impact and institutional memory of sars has meant that we have a tendency to view each new epidemic through the lens of the sars experience.   when the pandemic influenza a (h1n1)pdm09 \nvirus appeared on the horizon in april 2009, the initial planning in singapore that i could observe revolved around containing the disease \u2014\u00a0early detection of infected persons for hospitalisation and prolonged isolation, as well as quarantining their contacts.   this was triggered when the first patient in singapore was diagnosed in may 2009.   however, the pandemic influenza a (h1n1)pdm09 virus \u2014\u00a0like all influenza viruses \u2014\u00a0is a markedly different beast compared to the sars coronavirus (sars-cov).   it spreads far more easily in the community, and poses a far lower risk of death.   fewer than one per thousand will die after being infected by influenza compared to slightly more than one in 10 persons infected with sars.   what this means is that pandemic influenza could never have been contained in singapore, but the consequences of failing was not dire.   the ministry of health (moh) stepped down control measures for the influenza a (h1n1)pdm09 virus over a short few months and changed its disease outbreak response system condition alert level to green (normal) in february 2010, by which time an estimated several hundred thousand had been infected by flu.   doctors and public health professionals also believe the influence a (h1n1)pdm09 virus caused more deaths than sars.   did the initial measures slow down the spread of the influenza a (h1n1)pdm09 virus in singapore sufficiently so that the healthcare system was not overwhelmed and people had time to be socialised to the idea that the pandemic was not worse than the usual seasonal flu?   we do not know the answers to these questions.   fast forward to today, and it is clear now that there are crucial differences between sars and the current coronavirus outbreak that started in wuhan as well.   during its approximate nine-month course, sars infected 8,096 persons \u2014\u00a05,327 in mainland china \u2014\u00a0and resulted in 774 deaths.   a significant proportion of its spread occurred in hospitals (40.8 per cent in singapore). \nwithin a third of that time, the 2019-ncov has infected as of feb 3 over 16,000 persons \u2014\u00a0more than 98 per cent of whom are in china \u2014\u00a0and resulted in over 300 deaths.   almost the entirety of its spread has been in the community. part of the heightened case count is due to timing.   the wuhan outbreak occurred just before chinese new year, a period where the largest human migration on earth occurs.   the world is also far more connected today than in 2003. however, it is also apparent now that the novel coronavirus is more infectious\u00a0than the sars-cov, with several family or travel clusters among those diagnosed overseas.   asymptomatic infections have been reported, which did not happen with sars-cov, with germany reporting a plausible case of asymptomatic transmission of the virus.   the silver lining is that the 2019-ncov appears far less deadly compared to the sars-cov.   the case fatality rate of the 2019-ncov is currently estimated to be around 2 per cent (i.e. 2 out of every 100 infected will die), although the actual figure might be lower depending on the number of persons with mild disease who did not present to a healthcare facility and were thus undiagnosed.   so currently the 2019-ncov is shaping up to look less like sars-cov, and more like a virulent form of the influenza a (h1n1)pdm09 virus, although more data is required before we can be completely certain.   one important lesson is that the initial information obtained at the start of epidemics is incomplete and can be misleading.   in early january 2020, there was little to suggest that the 2019-ncov was different from the sars and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronaviruses in terms of how it spreads and the severity of infection.   similarly, the influenza a (h1n1)pdm09 virus\u00a0was initially believed to be as deadly as the spanish flu of 1918, which was estimated to have wiped out between 3 and 5 per cent of the human population.   within a few short weeks, however, sufficient information \nbecame available for a more concrete re-assessment in both 2009 and 2020.   we do not know at present whether the 2019-ncov epidemic can be contained.   china has instituted incredible control measures \u2014\u00a0in effect virtually quarantining an entire province \u2014\u00a0that would be unthinkable anywhere else in the world.   however, the virus has already spread to more than 25 countries worldwide, including several that will not be able to mount as robust a response as china and other high-income countries should community spread occur.   it is likely that the threat of 2019-ncov will be present far longer than the nine months of sars, while an effective vaccine will take far longer than a year to become commercially available.   it is useful to look at the 2019-ncov outbreak not through the lens of sars, but entirely on its own characteristics and calibrate measures and policies towards minimising impact and living life as normally as possible during this period.   \u00a0   about the author:\u00a0\u00a0   associate professor hsu li yang heads the infectious diseases programme and is co-director of the leadership institute for global health transformation at the saw swee hock school of public health, national university of singapore.

and a s$1.6 billion care and support package to help households with cost of living.   the special packages come on the back of lacklustre economic growth last year \u2014 0.7 per cent, the weakest since the 2008 global financial crisis.   on monday, the ministry of trade and industry downgraded its economic growth forecast to between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, down from 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent.   in his budget speech on tuesday (feb 18), mr heng, who is also finance minister, noted that covid-19 hit singapore \u201cjust as the global economy was beginning to recover\u201d.   \u201cthe outbreak will certainly impact our economy,\u201d said mr heng, adding that this is especially so since singapore\u2019s economy is now much more integrated with the economy of china, where the virus originated.\u00a0   the government is monitoring the situation and it is ready to do more if necessary\u00a0to help singaporeans cope with the economic impact, mr heng reiterated.\u00a0   comprising broad-based measures, the two packages will also feature targeted support, with the less well-off and industries more impacted by the outbreak getting more help.   \u00a0      broad-based help for firms, workers    jobs support scheme    under the stabilisation and support package, a s$1.3 billion jobs \nsupport scheme will be rolled out to benefit all enterprises and their local employees which total more than 1.9 million people. the government will pay for 8 per cent of the wages of these workers, up to a monthly cap of s$3,600 for three months, said mr heng.   this scheme will help businesses retain singapore workers and will be given to employers by the end of july. the measures are directed toward singaporean citizens and permanent residents, as well as both full-time and part-time hires.   enhanced wage credit scheme   the wage credit scheme currently co-funds wage increases for singaporean employees earning a gross monthly wage of up to s$4,000.   the cap will be raised to s$5,000 for qualifying wage increases given in 2019 and 2020. the government will also co-fund five percentage points more, raising the levels to 20 per cent for wage raises in 2019 and 15 per cent for those in 2020.   the enhancement will cost the government another s$1.1 billion, benefitting 90,000 enterprises and more than 700,000 singaporean employees, mr heng said.   other initiatives    a corporate income tax rebate at the rate of 25 per cent of tax payable, capped at s$15,000 per firm, will also help all tax-paying companies in singapore. this will cost the government s$400 million.   \u201cwe will also support tenants and lessees of government-managed properties,\u201d said mr heng.   tenants and lessees under the jtc corporation, the housing and development board (hdb), the singapore land authority, the singapore tourism board and the sentosa development corporation will receive help with rent, including more flexible rental payments.   firms can apply to the relevant agencies which will assess each request individually.   several tax treatments under the corporate tax system will also be enhanced for one year, such as allowing a faster write-down of investments in plant and machinery, renovation, and refurbishment under the 2021 year of assessment.   \u201cthis will put more cash in the hands of \nour enterprises. for example, hotels can now take advantage of this lull period to carry out upgrading work, and be better prepared for the rebound,\u201d said mr heng.   to help enterprises access working capital more easily, the working capital loan component under the enterprise financing scheme will be boosted for one year, with the maximum loan quantum doubled to s$600,000.   the government will also bear greater risks for these loans, with its share of risk upped to 80 per cent from the current range of 50 to 70 per cent.   \u201cwith the large part of the risk taken up by the government, i trust that our financial institutions will do their part to support our viable smes (small- and medium-sized enterprises),\u201d said mr heng.   targeted help for sectors directly hit by outbreak    additional help will be given to sectors directly affected by the outbreak \u2014 tourism, aviation, food services and retail, as well as point-to-point transport sectors.   these sectors will be given help to retain and reskill workers. the funding period for reskilling workers through redeployment programmes under the manpower ministry\u2019s adapt and grow initiative will be increased to a maximum of six months.   said mr heng: \u201ctogether with the jobs support scheme, we will support employers in these sectors to retain and train more than 330,000 local workers. these workers can make full use of the down time for training and upskilling to prepare for the recovery.\u201d   for the tourism sector, a property tax rebate of 30 per cent will be granted this year to accommodation and function room components of licensed hotels and serviced apartments, as well as venues for mice (meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions).   international cruise and regional ferry terminals will receive a 15 per cent property tax rebate, while integrated resorts will get a 10 per cent tax rebate.   a temporary bridging loan programme for the tourism sector will also be rolled out for a year, with a loan quantum of up to \ns$1 million and interest rates capped at 5 per cent. the government will also bear 80 per cent of the risk of the loan.   the aviation sector will benefit from a range of measures, including a 15 per cent property tax rebate for changi airport, as well as rebates on aircraft landing and parking charges, assistance for ground handling agents and rental rebates for shops and cargo agents at changi airport.   a transport ministry spokesperson said that the impact of the covid-19 outbreak on singapore\u2019s aviation industry has been significant, with more than 80 per cent of all scheduled flights between singapore and mainland china cancelled.   \u201cthere are now fewer than 80 services per week, compared with over 400 prior to the outbreak. passenger traffic has dropped,\u201d said the spokesperson, who added that traffic to singapore from other regions has also started to decline.   food services and retail businesses will also receive rental waivers or rebates. tenants at national environment agency-managed hawker centres and markets will get a full-month of rent waived, and other government agencies such as hdb will provide a half-month rent waiver to their commercial tenants.   those that operate out of private properties will also not be left out \u2014 landlords will be granted a 15 per cent property tax rebate for commercial properties that qualify.   \u201ci strongly urge landlords to pass this on to their tenants by reducing rentals,\u201d mr heng said.   for the point-to-point transport sector, which include taxi operators and private hire car firms, mr heng noted that the transport ministry had recently announced a support package for these businesses. many firms in this sector have come forward to support the initiative by matching the government\u2019s contribution, he added.   said mr heng: \u201cthis spirit of partnership is what we need to weather this challenging period together.\u201d   more details of the various measures will be revealed in the upcoming debates into the respective \nministries\u2019 budgets.   mr heng added that he will elaborate on the s$1.6 billion care and support package in the later part of his speech.   s$800m boost for frontline agencies   separately, apart from the two special packages, another s$800 million will be injected to support the frontline agencies dealing with the outbreak. the bulk of the amount will be channelled to the ministry of health.   \u201cthis is on top of the substantial resources already committed each year to public health,\u201d said mr heng, who then thanked all frontline officers who have been working tirelessly to fight against the outbreak \u2014 prompting other members of the house to thump\u00a0their armrests in support.\u00a0   paying tribute to the group, he said: \u201cyou exemplify the resilience and indomitable spirit of our people. but please take care of yourselves. i am confident that together, we will stay strong and get

"}, {"content": "weapon-brothers. moves you in these days in the abysses of the right to extreme right-wing US media landscape, it looks as though their propagandists just waiting for an event such as the corona pandemic. ben shapiro, chief editor of the website daily wire and podcaster, warned a few days in his show before that in future \"every four or five years,\" a virus in China would break out, and therefore it was not racist when donald trump the coronavirus \" the Chinese virus \"call. one week before the ultra-conservative radio presenter rush limbaugh said in his broadcast: \"nothing beats the destruction of the entire us economy by biobedrohung from China, right?\" and then there's stephen bannon, trumps former chief strategist and ex-chief of the white-supremacy-platform breitbart. In his podcast war room, the bannon leads since October last year, is all about since the end of January almost corona, a private format has bannon for established, whose title sounds like action game, war room: pandemic. as the epidemic in the Chinese province hubei its beginning took speculated bannon with its guests about the fact that it was virus emerged wuhan in a secret biological weapons program in the local provincial capital (this conspiracy theory has long been recognized as such and refuted). he claimed that the world health organization was bought by China. in another episode bannon said the fantasized for years about an imminent war in the South China Sea that China's communist party with the same methods as hitler and goebbels work. Bannon are conspiracy theories grotesque. he may after his brief gastspiel in the white house and near the now accounts back to a political outsider have developed a clown actually. However, the fact remains that figures as in the usa have a multi-million audience. bannon was in the \nLast weeks several times invited to shipments of the Trump favorite station, the news channel Fox News. And should vote what the magazine New York reported in January, then his podcast is also heard of the White House staff. Two years after Trump grew the Bannon bannon bannon from his team later \"Sloppy Steve\", it almost seems like the two approached slowly. Donald Trump is not only transmitter, he is more than any of its predecessors also willing recipients of media messages. Who wants to understand what Trump says, why is not a new realization - that's just what TRUPM is doing best: Fox News look. The most widely strongest news channel of the United States regularly set topics that the President picks up shortly thereafter; The turn regularly fabricates messages (including a barely manageable amount of untruths), the Fox News spread quickly. Both need each other. Both also need the constant enemy delay to keep their own voters or spectators in a mood. At first glance, it looks like this symbiotic relationship continued in recent weeks of the retracting and now seemingly unbraked corona crisis as usual. Trump initially denied - synchronously with the on-air statements of most Fox news presenters - the dangers of the coronavirus and accused the political opponent, the Democratic Party, again, to operate a conspiracy against him and the country. According to the Mueller investigations, according to the impeachment procedure, Corona should be the next alleged \"Hoax\", the next invented history to reduce the president and its supposed performance. In the course of the month of March, Trump's rhetoric changed, again in line with his home station. The sound was temporarily more careful, sometimes even in the conventional one \nPresidential. Until Donald Trump lost patience a few days ago, apparently he takes everything to him with this virus: after Easter, so in the middle of April, the country must be \"opened\" again, called Trump (and commanded Fox News. The President, apparently, wants to see the initial restrictions in which existing in vast parts of the United States would preferably be repealed. The economic engine should be deforized, by cold start from zero to a hundred. Trump, who explained the state of US stock indexes to the degree knife of his political work, can not use recession. not a few months before the presidential election. Trump is going, which have confirmed the past few weeks impressively, primarily for one thing: his re-election in November. In short, it looked as if at least the interpretation sovereignty about this crisis - that his administration had important weeks, passed almost two months without developing a federal prevention strategy against the spread of the coronavirus is obvious. Now it's about keeping at least the spin on the crisis to determine the narrative. Since Trump has positioned itself as a strong leader in the daily corona press conferences in the White House, its popularity rises again. Depending on the survey, Trump's approval values \u200b\u200bare up to 49 percent, which are amazingly high levels in view of the obviously poor crisis management of his administration. Looking at the past three months since the Customer of the Corona outbreak in the Chinese province of Wuhan, a matter in political-medial America was different this time than usual. There was a top-class Fox news presenter, which is much earlier than the others The subject of Corona has fallen. Already in January, when his colleagues, the president and even most competitors were still mainly busy with the impeachment procedure, Tucker Carlson hit Corona \nalarm. Carlson sends every night to the Prime Time at 8pm and is one of the most influential atmospherics of the country. It was even more memorable that Carlson had already found a guilty before the mass dissemination of Covid-19 infections in the US had ever started. Carlson was responsible for the \"Chinese culture\" when Trump Via Twitter thanked Chinese President Xi Jinping for its handling of the virus. In a sense, Carlson was \"Trumpesker as Trump\", as the Vanity Fair formulated a few days ago: Carlson saw a chance in the virus, but a racist. He laid the foundation for what since then has always been stronger in the US: the right instrumentalization of the pandemic. that Trump, who talked about the end of February, the number of infected in the US will soon be at \"near Zero\", now sees his country in a \"war\" against the \"Chinese virus\" and itself as \"President in War Times \"Apparently, Tucker Carlson has decided to decide an extraordinary intervention at the beginning of March. After the moderator had observed for weeks of trump's obvious denial of the upring Corona crisis, he traveled to Florida on March 7, to convince Trump there, in his private club Mar-A-Lago, ahead of the seriousness of the situation. He had a \"moral commitment feeling,\" Carlson said later in an interview. For two hours, the conversation should have taken between the two men. Apparently with effect. Much of what TRUPP has been doing since then follows Carlson's script. This is: find a simple story for a complex situation. More than three million Americans have already lost their work in the past two weeks due to the factual freezing of the US economy, the country moves on a recession that hospitals in particularly affected major cities such as New York City and \nSeattle are long overloaded. Trump now tries to find answers as well as deflections. The direction is becoming increasingly evident: still harder protecting the national borders; even more vehemently emphasize the alleged enemies of the country; Summon even stronger American patriotism and exceptionalism; Even more furious the domestic economy praise - and at the same time warn against her downfall. In short: Trump will probably get even more Trump. And the right media will help him in particular Fox News. The figure Tucker Carlson is not only interesting to understand trump's tactical change. Carlson's daily program also shows how panic production works. In the monologists who hold the 50-year-old at the beginning of each program, he damn everything that is somehow left: principal approval of immigration, feminism, climate protection, political correctness, globalism, diversity. What Carlson distinguishes from the other Fox-News-Anchors is his occasional assault against Republicans. Carlson gladly stages as an empinded loudspeaker of the simple worker. But the supposed opposition to the establishment fulfills - just like Trump - ultimately only the purpose of playing the chauvinist part of the White America against minorities and immigrants. Already in the first broadcast, where Carlson reported about the Corona virus, on January 23, he let realize which message to arrive at his spectators. \"I know we have to do so as if all cultures and all behaviors were the same,\" Carlson said, but that was not the case. \"The mistreatment of animals, the food of koalas and snakes and bats and dogs, that is in this city, Wuhan, apparently usual,\" he continued. What Tucker Carlson hammered his millions of viewers daily in the next two months, can be twisted about this story that he summarized in his broadcast on March 6th \nDay before his trip to Florida: The communist China has only taken control of the global pharmaceutical business, then released a virus to the world, and because liberal media and left-wing activists in the USA antiracism and identity policy is more important than safe limits, would now have to be a few people die. Not for climate change is the existential US threat to the USA, but the alleged dependence on China. \"The people who told us that life in a boundless world do not make disadvantages,\" so the moderator. \"Trump was right with everything: trade, immigration, production, globalization.\" Carlson's Embassy was unmistakable: the Corona crisis is a chance to finally implement Trump's slogan \"Make America Great Again\". The message seems to have arrived. \"I believe that we have learned a lot. We have learned a lot. This crisis has made it clear how important it is to have strong limits and a robust production sector,\" said Trump recently at a press conference. A few days earlier his staff had sent an e-mail to Trump Supporters, in which it was called the US, \"not only attacked by an invisible virus, but also by the Chinese\". The fact that the number of attacks on Americans with Asian origin history has increased sharply in recent weeks, it is likely to be a direct consequence of these propaganda. \"I've never felt like that in this country in my 27 years,\" Jiayang's fan wrote an author of New Yorker, in mid-March at Twitter. One can no longer accuse Trump after over three years in the White House: that he is difficult to read. Let's follow his impulses, he follows Fox News. He knows no shame, content contradictions do not care. First and foremost, it is always about saying his power. In the way it is remarkably transparent. As far as the Corona-Narrativ is concerned, the \nPresident and the right media makers obviously agreed. The narrative is called war. That that is not only meant rhetorical is becoming increasingly clear. On March 26, the magazine The nation reported that the government in Washington will send additional 1,500 soldiers to the Mexican and Canadian border. While cities like New York have been waiting for Washington's support for weeks, the government sets up the already overmilitarized limit. \"I'm a president in war,\" Trump said a few days ago at a press conference. And told: \"This is a war. Another kind of war when we ever had it.\" "}, {"content": "chinese doctor who first found out about coronavirus was censored. now, he's dead due to virus. the chinese doctor who first warned his government of the coronavirus outbreak but had his claims dismissed has now died of the virus.\nli wenliang, who had first shared suspicion of a sars-like illness spreading in wuhan, died on thursday after he was infected by the coronavirus, the state-run global times reported.\n34-year-old wenliang, an ophthalmologist at the wuhan central hospital, first told his friends about a viral infection spreading through the district via private messages as early as december 30.\nhe was the first to report about the virus way back in december last year when it first emerged in wuhan, the provincial capital of china's central hubei province.\nhe had told other doctors through a chat on the chinese messaging app wechat that seven patients admitted in his hospital were exhibiting sars-like symptoms. the ophthalmologist said all seven patients had eaten animal meat from the same seafood market in hubei.\nli explained that, according to a test he had seen, the illness was a coronavirus -- a large family of viruses that includes severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) which led to 800 death in china and the world in 2003.\nchina has a troubled history with sars (severe acute respiratory diseases). a sars outbreak in 2003 in southern china had left more than 8,000 people infected and 774 dead over 17 nations.\nli's message was meant to be a cautionary note for his medical school friends to take care of their loved ones. but within hours of wenliang revealing the information, the chats spread like wildfire on chinese social media.\nhis name was exposed to hundreds of citizens. \"when i saw them circulating online, i realised that it was out of my control and i would probably be punished,\" li was quoted as saying by cnn recently.\nand that is exactly what happened.\nauthorities silence news of outbreak\non january 3, chinese authorities summoned li and seven other doctors and accused them of spreading rumours. a stern message calling for an end to rumour-mongering was broadcast across china.\n\"the police call on all netizens to not fabricate rumours, not spread rumours, not believe rumours,\" the message read.\nli was made to sign an affidavit acknowledging his crime and had to promise he will not engage in any such activities in the future.\nbut li's troubles did not end there.\nthe ophthalmologist returned to work soon. while treating a patient affected with coronavirus, the infection was also transmitted to li. over the coming days, he showed the same symptoms -- coughing, shortness of breath and fever.\nby january 12, he was admitted to a hospital. his condition continued to deteriorate and he had to be shifted to the icu.\nit was not till january 20 that china would take stock of the spread of coronavirus and declare a national emergency. on the same day, chinese president xi jinping said, \"people's lives and health should be given top priority and the spread of the outbreak should be resolutely curbed.\"\nli's diagnosis of coronavirus was only confirmed on february 1. he died five days later.\ntoo much censorship led to virus outbreak\na too-harsh crackdown on online rumours during china\u2019s deadly viral epidemic had undermined public trust, china's top court said in a highly rare rebuke of the police force.\nsupreme court judge tang xinghua wrote wednesday that officers should have been more lenient with those informing of the outbreak.\nif the public had believed these rumours\u2019 at the time, and carried out measures like wearing masks, strictly disinfecting and avoiding wildlife markets it might have been a good thing, he said.\nwuhan police responded in a post on the social media platform weibo that they had only given education and criticism to the eight and had not meted out harsher punishment such as warnings, fines, or detention.\nbut some users were unhappy with the reply, with one demanding the police apologize and asking: is it so hard to acknowledge you have done wrong?\nauthorities in wuhan have already been criticized online for withholding information about the infection until the end of last year, despite knowing about the new illness weeks earlier.\noverall 564 people have died in china due to the virus and 28,018 confirmed cases have been reported from 31 provincial-level regions, the national health commission reported on thursday.

A black swan is walks through Asia and its global impact should still be determined. The Wuhan Coronavirus is an example of an unexpected event manual that affects health and economics. Protein consumption in emerging countries has skyrocketed as its economy and standard of living have grown. The interaction between animal viruses and human diseases as well. A known risk, but unfortunately increasingly frequent. It may be fried, but there is also a risk that it becomes a world pandemic. The most similar previous experience was that of the SARS virus in 2002-2003. Since then, the mechanisms of prevention and reaction to sanitary alerts throughout Asia have improved. In countries such as South Korea, I have been able to appreciate personally a few days ago that, even though the incidence is almost null, public messages in networks and sanitary measures are considerable.\nWhat is now managed is a significant uncertainty that already has a significant negative economic impact. To date, the consequences of this type of events have not been extended beyond a few months. It is not a great relief, in any case, because if the coronavirus becomes a pandemic, the effects can be serious at a time of a certain decay. The resistance of a weak global economy by 2020 goes through the evolution of the Chinese economy and coronavirus does not help. The first reflections are already appreciated. They have come for the price of crude. The fall in demand - among other issues for lower industrial activity and land and air traffic in China - reduced the price of Brent barrel by 6% only last week.\nBrackets value and volatility indexes have not yet reacted to these fears appreciably. But in the market analysis forums the risk of contagion is in all the mouths. If this and other geopolitical hazards - such as tensions with Iran - are no more reflected in markets it is because these are more pending from central banks. The laxity of monetary policy seems to have diminished the ability to issue warning signs.\nIf you reach a pandemic, the experience dictates that the values \u200b\u200bof emerging companies could be affected, with falls of up to 20%. SARS took the lives of 800 people and had an estimated cost of 50,000 million dollars.

In just over three days, Italy attended an exponential increase in positive cases: if until Friday, only three people infected with the virus, and all of them identified as newcomers of the Chinese city of Wuhan - where the outbreak began By the end of last year - this Tuesday died three more people, raising the total balance to 11. The cases of recent days are provoking a race to the masks. This Tuesday, the Italian judicial authorities have opened an investigation to the rapid climbing of online sales prices of products such as clinical masks and disinfectant gel jars, with vice-attorney general of Milan, Tiziana Siciliano, to report \"absurd prices.\" \"The online price of the masks rose from a cent for ten euros each and that of a bottle of a liter of disinfectant gel that a week cost seven euros went up yesterday for 39 euros\", exemplified, quoted by Reuters.

However, nearby, Austria, Croatia and Switzerland confirmed cases of infection. Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovi\u0107 confirmed the first case of infection in the country of the Balkans. \"The patient is in a clinic of infectious diseases in Zagreb. He is a younger person and has light symptoms. He is in isolation and his condition is positive, at the moment, \"explained the ruler quoted by The Guardian. minutes before it was Austria to confirm the first two cases detected. A spokesman for the health authority of Tirol Province - which borders the northern region of Italy - confirmed that two Italians accused positive in coronavirus control. Local Social Communication Agencies affirm that the governor of this Austrian province, Guenther Platter, said that the two men had recently traveled to the Lombardy region, one of the most affected in the neighboring country, pointing out this displacement as the likely cause of infection.

About a thousand tourists inside are in isolation and will undergo medical examinations. This is because, on Monday, an Italian tourist who was staying there was diagnosed with the new Coronavirus Covid-19. Despite the detection of new cases in recent days in some European countries, the neighboring countries of Italy decided not to replace their borders, \"we agreed to keep the boundaries open, since it closes it would be a disproportionate and poorly efficient measure at this point,\" said the \nItalian Minister, Roberto Speranza, following a meeting with European counterparts, quoted by Reuters. Portugal is to strengthen the prevention and network of laboratories and hospitals available to receive suspected cases of infection by new coronavirus, Covid-19. Also the information at airports is being strengthened and flights from Italy, which is living the greatest outbreak of the disease in Europe, will have a distribution of pamphlets with the indication of the criteria for the suspect case and the number of the SNS 24, where People should call. So far all suspected cases in Portugal had negative results. At the time of closing of this newspaper, two suspected cases were being analyzed in Portugal - two citizens who have recently returned from Milan.

But it is not only in Europe that struggles against Covid-19. However, the South Korean authorities are preparing to submit to medical examinations more than 220,000 people belonging to a religious worship. The government considers that this organization, the Church of Jesus of Shincheonji, played a key role in the spread of the new Coronavirus (Covid-19) in the country. The leader of this group agreed to give up the authorities the identification of members, so that they can be targeted by clinical control. On Sunday, South Korea declared \nThe highest level of alert, due to the number of cases of infection by the new coronavirus, which reached 602, with six dead.

After three meetings, the World Health Organization (WHO) decided that the outbreak of coronavirus should be classified as a public health emergency of international interest. What can this change in relation to the various containment measures applied throughout the world? little or almost nothing. Obviously, health authorities were not waiting for the WHO decision to advance with all control measures under the precautionary principle. The fact that the new coronavirus has already entered 18 countries after the identification of the outbreak in December in the city of Wuhan, China, and the confirmation of transmission of the disease between humans outside the Chinese territory will have been two factors that led to WHO to convene The experts once again. The Emergency Committee met for the third time in the period of a week to discuss the need to declare a global public health emergency. Currently, there are 98 cases in 18 countries outside China, including 8 person's person transmission cases in four countries: Germany, Japan, Vietnam and USA. When the meeting was still taking place on the daily Bulletin of WHO on Coronavirus on Thursday he updated the numbers rising from 15 to 18 countries affected in relation to the previous day. It was further underlined that the new cases detected in Finland, Philippines and India have some connection to travel to the city of Wuhan. In the bulletin, WHO referred to 7818 confirmed cases and 170 deaths. However, the numbers updated at night pointed to 8235 infected patients with 171 dead, according to a team at Johns Hopkins University (in the US) that accompanies the situation. \"We have to remember that they are not just numbers, they are people,\" said WHO Director-General. Invoking an international public health emergency (Pheic, in the acronym in English) is basically the most important signal that WHO can give the world. The rules of this \nProcess say that to declare a Pheic the situation in analysis has to comply with three criteria: it must be an extraordinary event, with a risk that represents a high danger to the public health of other countries and requiring a coordinated international response. It is the sixth time WHO resorts to this global warning instrument. \"Let's be clear, this statement is not a vote of lack of confidence in China,\" said Tedros Adhanom Ghreyesus, Director-General of the WHO to journalists. \"Our biggest concern is the potential of the virus spread to countries with more fragile health systems,\" he added. The WHO panel, presided over by Didier Houssin, from France, is composed of 16 independent specialists. \"The main reason for this statement is not what is happening in China, but what is happening in other countries,\" he emphasized. With this new designation to classify the new coronavirus epidemic that was detected in December in China, WHO can make recommendations to all countries to control the outbreak. Something that has begun to do a long time ago. You can also issue passenger travel and surveillance recommendations at international airports and other arrival ports. Something that also will not be necessary because many countries have advanced for such contention measures. \"WHO does not recommend travel restriction, trade and [people] movements and oppose all travel constraints,\" said WHO's Director-General at the press conference that took place this Thursday At the end of the day, at the headquarters of the organization, in Geneva, Switzerland. The WHO decision can also lead to an increase in funding and resources to contain the outbreak. This is at first glance the main difference we can see in relation to the last few days. But it is not easy to imagine how countries can further strengthen the effort they have shown in surveillance, detection and follow-up of new cases. This one \nNew Coronavirus manifests itself with a variable gravity, from light symptoms similar to a flu or constipation to more severe symptoms such as pneumonia (among the 7818 infected for 1370 in a situation considered serious). The incubation period varies between two and 12 days the money could serve to impose more measures on the ground, but also to invest in the scientific \"machine\" that has been working in this field too early. The first virus genome was shared by China's team with the international community earlier this month. This Thursday, once again, WHO Director-General praised China for collaboration throughout the process. \"We would have seen many other cases outside China - and probably deaths were not going to be the government's efforts and progress they have made to protect the population from China and from all over the world.\" \"The only way to defeat this outbreak is with all countries to work together in a spirit of solidarity and cooperation,\" concluded Tedros Adhanom Ghebrueysus, leaving the warning in a call: \"This is the moment of facts, not fear. This is the moment of science, not rumors. This is the moment of solidarity, not of stigma. \" It will be cooperation between all countries that will be possible to reduce the number of infected people. And this is the key to catching the epidemic, says to the public Nuno Faria, a professor associated with genomic epidemiology of the University of Oxford, United Kingdom. Thus, it continues, \"there are two ways to reduce the number of infected people.\" \"One is through vaccines and treatment, which unfortunately are not yet available to the new virus. Although there are already teams in continental China, the United States and Hong Kong, working in a vaccine will take some time until we have an effective vaccine. The other involves control of the epidemic through a serial interventions aimed at reducing contact between infected persons and persons still susceptible to the new virus. \" The alliance \nFor innovations for readiness for epidemics (CEPI, in the acronym in English) announced a short time after three different research teams are trying to develop vaccines against the new coronavirus. The aim is to begin in June clinical trials for at least one of the vaccines. Research teams will have different approaches: one will be led by modern pharmaceutical company together with the National Institute for allergy and US infectious diseases; another by the innovative company; And the third by a team at the University of Queensland in Australia. \"There are no guarantees of success, but we hope this work is a significant and important step in the development of a vaccine for this disease,\" said Richard Hatchett, CEPI executive director.

It is a reflection of increased surveillance. \"In just a week at least seven universities and public health institutions have drawn and shared new diagnostic methods for the new virus. With the increase in cases to be tested, an increase in the number of cases confirmed also \", finds Nuno would. The impact of this new virus will depend on various factors that are not yet complete or completely clear, including the mortality rate and transmissibility, that is, the ease with which it propagates in the population. The current estimates situated the mortality rate of the 2019-Ncov abaffixo of the 3%. \"To contextualize, other coronaviruses that have caused recent outbreaks such as SARS [in 2003] and MERS [in 2012] have a much higher mortality rate in the order of 10% and 37%, respectively. However, one of the concerns regarding the new 2019-NCOV coronavirus is more ease with which it transmits between humans compared to their \n'Primos' Sars and Mers, \"says the Portuguese epidemiologist who collaborates with WHO. The last time the WHO declared a global public health emergency was in 2019 for the outbreak of Ebola virus, which is still underway in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has already killed more than 2000 people. WHO has also considered as international public health emergencies the following epidemics: in 2016, the Zika virus; In 2014, the previous Ebola outbreak in West Africa and killed more than 11,000 people between 2014 and 2016; In 2014, poliomyelitis; In 2009, swine flu (the H1N1 virus).

the s&p 500 by 4.6%, the dow jones by 5% and the nasdaq by 4.5%. world stock markets had a weeklong slide last week on coronavirus fears. new york governor andrew cuomo welcomed a cdc decision allowing new york to test for the virus. there have been more than 87,000 cases worldwide and nearly 3,000 deaths in 60 countries since it emerged in china in december, the world health organization said. \u201ci would like to have a goal of 1,000-tests-per-day capacity within one week because, again, the more testing, the better,\u201d cuomo said at a briefing on monday. federal health officials have said the number of test kits for coronavirus would be radically expanded in coming weeks. the united states appeared poised for a spike in cases, partly because there would be more \ntesting to confirm infections. protective gear and test kits were being distributed to u.s. military facilities with a priority on distribution to the korean peninsula, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, army general mark milley, said at a briefing. south korea is one of the hardest hit countries with 4,335 cases and 26 deaths. u.s. government military laboratories were working to develop a vaccine, milley said. trump said his administration has asked pharmaceutical companies to accelerate work on the development of a coronavirus vaccine, but provided no details. top u.s. health officials have said any vaccine is up to 18 months away and there is no treatment for the respiratory disease, although patients can receive supportive care. u.s. health secretary alex azar said the administration is working on supply chain challenges for pharmaceutical companies in response to coronavirus as many active ingredients come from china. the white house is also expected to meet this week with top executives from u.s. airlines and the cruise industry over the impact of the virus to their businesses, two people briefed on the matter said. as early as this week, the u.s. congress could debate and pass emergency funding, possibly in the range of $6 billion to $8 billion, to help battle the virus and aid businesses.

novel coronavirus (ncov). however, to avoid taking chances, each person has been home quarantined for an additional 14 days, with their respective district hospitals monitoring the situation. with over 80,239 cases worldwide and 2,700 deaths (as of february 26), the human cost of ncov has been making headlines since december 2019, and no country wants to take the threat lightly. the virus was first identified as ncov, then changed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), and finally named coronavirus disease (covid-19) by the world health organization. the devastating effects of a virus pandemic are being felt all the more by the global community this time around, because of the visual outpouring from wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak. this is not a tragedy happening in a forgotten corner of the planet. it is unfolding in the heart of the world\u2019s largest economy. footage of helpless residents not being able to come close to their own family and desperate foreigners begging to return to their home countries have been doing the rounds for over two months. in india, the impact of ncov has been considerably small, with just three confirmed outbreaks in kerala. all of whom have now recovered and are under medical supervision. the state has experienced virus outbreaks before and its health department began precautionary measures for ncov even before they were implemented at a national \nlevel. india might have escaped ncov, but given the worrying trend of virus outbreaks every few years, we need to ask do we have a system in place to handle a wuhan-sized pandemic? the burden of control and eradication of disease when it reaches alarming proportions does not fall entirely on a country\u2019s health system. it is supported by various other agencies. while in india, the ministry of health and family welfare is the nodal ministry handling biological and health emergencies, such crises also come under the purview of disaster management agencies, the ministry of home affairs and the national crisis management committee (ncmc). india has pioneered the delhi declaration on emergency preparedness\u2019 which identifies risks, implements disaster risk reduction measures and prepares and operationalises readiness for a broad range of disasters, including diseases and outbreaks, says professor s.s. vasan, an indian-origin scientist who is leading the vaccine development against the ncov at the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation, australia. however, for a long time, disaster management in india followed no defined path and remained an informal state subject, since after the bengal famine of 1943 it was assumed that the only disasters india could face would be related to food shortages. there was no mention of disaster management in the constitution as a state or a central subject. despite such calamities as the 1950 assam earthquake or the bhopal gas disaster of 1984, it was only after the 2001 bhuj earthquake and the setting up of the national disaster management authority (ndma) in 2005 that disaster management protocols and policies were evolved. an outbreak of ncov, a biological disaster, would be part of chemical biological radiological and nuclear (cbrn) defence. as such the states or the health ministry can request additional assistance from the ndma, the national disaster response force (ndrf) as well as the armed forces. a nation \nalerted the standard procedure for a health emergency would start at the point of outbreak, then be tackled from a state perspective and, finally, be seen through a national lens. however, when the threat is coming from an international source, like ncov, the system is reversed. the first level of action is national to prevent the virus from reaching indian soil. india\u2019s initial response to ncov was slow compared to other countries. the outbreak in wuhan began to show signs of a serious epidemic in early january, and the european countries, singapore, japan and the us began to trace and isolate their china returnees almost immediately. in india, the national centre for disease control (ncdc) only monitors public health. we are yet to establish an organisation meant to watch health emergencies around the world, a practice followed by many countries in the west. as a result, india began rolling out its emergency health machinery to tackle ncov only by the end of january. a group of ministers (gom) was constituted on the directions of prime minister narendra modi on january 30 and held its first meeting on february 3 for the management of ncov. members included the union health minister dr harsh vardhan, minister of civil aviation hardeep s. puri, external affairs minister s. jaishankar, minister of state for home g. kishan reddy, minister of state for health and family welfare ashwini kumar choubey, and minister of state for shipping mansukh lal mandaviya. following the first meeting, the health ministry addressed four key issues a risk advisory, travel screening, lab testing and quarantine facilities. screening posts were set up at 21 international airports and 12 major ports. staff at these entry points were trained to screen for possible infections after the ebola outbreak in 2014, when the directorate general of health services (dghs) outlined the roles of health officers at airports to handle future infections. passengers from suspected routes are given a leaflet \nto check if they are displaying certain symptoms and then screened on deboarding. immigration officers and security personnel have been sensitised on how to handle passengers and equipped with personal protection equipment. around 4,214 flights and 448,449 passengers have been screened till date. the second step was to isolate china returnees and suspected cases. a total of 23,259 people have been brought under community surveillance. every state is equipped with a rapid response team and government hospitals in each district are marked as isolation wards. the health teams can also ask for private hospitals to be on standby in delhi, for instance, both rml hospital and safdarjung hospital have 25-bed isolation wards for ncov cases. in case of a pandemic, hospitals will suspend regular work, which takes up about 80 per cent of the beds, to accommodate more patients, says dr jagdish prasad, former director general of health services. zika and ebola, he says, were major turning points for health emergency services in india. we started to rethink our requirements for disease control at a national level, adds prasad, who is also the founder principal of safdarjung hospital and presently a principal consultant with the dghs. the national institute for virology (niv) pune, one of the 15 global laboratories identified by the who to provide reference testing for the ncov, was also put on alert. though india has a long way to go for native virological studies and vaccine development teams, we are not too far behind either in terms of laboratory training and testing. the us\u2019s centre for disease control and prevention, for example, has been training lab staff in india to handle, test and identify viruses. the ncdc, too, is equipped to support labs in testing. there are 105 viral research and diagnostic labs across india to support niv if needed. for ncov, 2,707 samples have been sent so far to niv for a full report; only three from kerala have tested positive. the health \nministry has issued advisories for the public, health workers and airport and lab staff, including travel and discharge advisories, guidelines for managing infected persons, isolating patients, and packaging and transporting test samples. disaster management agencies on stand by in the event that a health outbreak is identified as a national threat, each state has a disease surveillance programme which sends a daily report to the ncmc and the ndma. the latter then view the crisis from a national and inter-state perspective and work with state teams to recommend measures, check resources and connect states to border and central agencies, if needed. the first step was to have screenings at all porous and non-porous borders, and identify isolation wards. in kerala, for example, there were two hospitals in each district where isolation wards for ncov cases were set up, says saurabh dalal, consultant for medical preparedness and biological disasters, ndma, who was in kerala to monitor ncov management. going forward, we plan to have a pandemic preparedness plan for each district. only when all community resources have been exhausted will assistance from ndrf be requested. as it was during the nipah outbreak of 2018, the ndrf is on stand-by were ncov to turn into a serious health pandemic. the ndrf functions as a force of assistance to states under the assumption that there is a requisition made, says s.n. pradhan, director general of ndrf. we have 12 battalions and 18 specialised teams, two of which are specifically trained to handle biological emergencies. once ncov was identified as a possible threat, we distributed about 100 suits to our battalions and sent our doctors to sensitise the immigration bureau that would be dealing directly with passengers from high-risk routes. in china, a 1,000-bed hospital was set up within 10 days and wuhan was cordoned off. in india, the army can rapidly deploy such resources and shut down a state if needed. but it can be decided only \nat the cabinet level, along with the ministry of home affairs, says pradhan. state action plan states can use disaster response funds from the ndma to detect and handle a crisis. each state is also equipped with district emergency centres, and district magistrates become incident commanders. a private limited company under the state health department and the national health mission maintains stockpiles of personal protection equipment, masks and biological suits. kerala became the first state to declare a state emergency for a public health disaster. it was lifted within the first week of february. widely praised for its handling of the ncov crisis, not only did kerala ensure mass isolation for suspected cases, it also made sure that 4 million children in schools were educated about the virus. special advisories were issued for the blind, elderly, illiterate, differently-abled and health workers (demographic segments often overlooked during disaster communication). however, it is important to note state discrepancies in cases of health crises. kerala enjoys a better quality of public healthcare and better health indicators than several northern states. not every state has the capacity to handle a virus outbreak in the same manner. the ndma has plans to document kerala\u2019s management of ncov as a future example to other states. overall, our health disaster management largely rests on short-term steps for control and eradication. the long-term repercussions still need to be considered. there are other aspects of a pandemic that could have crippling effects on morale and economy. food shortages, financial loss, miscommunication and human rights abuse are aspects of disaster management that have never been handled before. the 2003 sars outbreak, for instance, is estimated to have resulted in global economic losses to the tune of $30-100 billion, according to the asian development bank; ncov is predicted to have a similar impact. another loophole in the system is the \npresence of multiple agencies the health and home ministries, ncmc, ndma, ndrf, ncdc and state health departments each with a stake in biological disaster management. having too many bureaucratic players inevitably leads to longer decision time, confusion and overlap in responsibilities. while we have the guidelines on paper, real life implementation is an altogether different story. "}, {"content": "a black swan arrives: investors keep watch as covid-19 outbreak changes market sentiments. the coronavirus outbreak has been very much in the news and, apart from its impact on public health and the economy, is\u00a0also affecting\u00a0investments.   investors should position their portfolio carefully and watch markets closely during this period.   impact on stock markets   concerns about the covid-19 coronavirus\u00a0in various countries continue to roil the markets with a heavy dose of volatility, financial advisory firm etf database observed.   british newspaper the guardian reported that financial markets remain confident the crisis will soon blow over, as share prices have been rebounding because investors think the coronavirus can be contained.   yet, it also noted that mohamed el-erian, the chief economic adviser to insurance company allianz, thinks that the economic damage could be a black swan event equivalent to the collapse of the us sub-prime mortgage market.   black swan events is a term popularised by writer nassim taleb and based on a\u00a0saying that black swans did not exist (until they were discovered in the wild).   they are events that come as a complete surprise, have profound consequences and are rationalised by people who never saw the crisis coming and who then say after the fact that it was glaringly obvious that there was trouble ahead.\u00a0   the epidemic in china caused by coronavirus covid-19 and the infections spreading in other\u00a0countries have already become a black swan event for the asia-pacific tourism industry, business information company ihs markit says. it could hit other sectors as well.   market forecasts   while investors understandably want to know what to do at this time of uncertainty. financial advisory firm evergreen gavekal\u2019s adviser arthur kroebel says that it is a \u201cfool\u2019s errand\u201d to come up with highly specific forecasts for the ultimate impact on chinese, regional or global gross domestic product (gdp) given the uncertainties involved.   if \nit does turn into a global pandemic, he said, global supply chains would face more disruption, commodity prices would fall more severely, and central banks would face pressure to offset the impact.\u00a0   already, though, financial services firm ing expects that potential spreading of the virus across the globe could last until march or april and mark a new downside risk to the global economy in the first half of 2020.   investment bank jp morgan said that the coronavirus remains in its early stages and \u201cis likely to worsen before getting better\u201d.   here in singapore, dbs bank said that the outbreak has thrown the singapore economy a curveball.   supply chain disruptions such as extended factory closures within china will have a significant impact on singapore\u2019s manufacturing sector, for example, and consumer spending is expected to be dampened as residents take more precautionary actions in their daily lives.   as a result, \u201cwe are downgrading our 2020 real gdp forecast to 0.9% (from 1.4%) in response to the potential impact. the concern is that the impact could be deeper than sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome).\u201d   over in hong kong, the guardian said that the economy risks being plunged deeper into recession as the outbreak wreaks havoc, with consumers panic-buying staple goods and airlines stopping flights.\u00a0  position your portfolio protectively   amid all these uncertainties, a key question for investors is how to position their investment portfolio well and prepare effectively for whatever the next several months may bring.   \u201cwhen you don\u2019t know,\u201d mr ray dalio, founder of hedge-fund giant bridgewater associates told marketwatch, \u201cthe best investment strategy is to be smartly diversified across geographic locations, asset classes, and currencies.\u201d   so far, he said, \u201cfears of the spreading coronavirus have triggered a \u2018flight-to-quality\u2019 that continues to pressure stocks while giving a lift to hedges such as gold, bonds and the (us) dollar.\u201d   british \nfinancial research firm trustnet similarly said that some investors have started taking more defensive positions, with government bonds and gold being preferred options.   for stocks, it could be advantageous to avoid vulnerable companies in the tourism sector such as airlines and cruise lines or hotels and to buy companies such as e-commerce or food delivery firms that will benefit even if consumers stay at home.   investors can also benefit by taking advantage of shifts in the market.   while jpmorgan chase analysts noted that previous global health scares such as sars and zika did not unsettle equities for an extended period, the msci hong kong index lost about 9 per cent during the sars epidemic and then jumped17 per cent in the three months after the disease faded from view.   investment brokerage schwab similarly said that although there is always a chance that this outbreak could have greater consequences, the global economy and markets have been relatively immune to the effects of past viral epidemics. \u201ca short-term dip in stocks tended to be followed by the continuation of the upward trend,\u201d it said.   while there is uncertainty about the impact on investments and a panicked rush to buy less risky assets is not appropriate, investors would be well-advised to examine their portfolio and ensure that it is sufficiently diversified.   given the uncertainties, it could also be advisable to take a more defensive posture than usual over the next several months and increase the allocation to investments in bonds while reducing the allocation to stocks and potentially shifting the types of stocks in the portfolio.   even though the timing of an upturn is uncertain, watching trends and taking advantage of dips to buy if markets rebound could also be beneficial.

non-essential travel abroad with immediate effect, the ministry of health (moh) said. \n about 40 per cent of international arrivals into changi airport are from asean countries, almost four times more than chinese travellers, said mr paul chew, head of research at phillip securities. \n asean comprises indonesia, the philippines, vietnam, cambodia, laos, thailand, malaysia, brunei, myanmar and

Four continents has already achieved the new coronavirus: from China, people have worn it in other parts of Asia, to Australia, Europe and North America. In Africa but it has not arrived yet. But what if? The pathogen, who has already killed 500 people and has infected tens of thousands, would meet countries here, whose health systems are as weak as perhaps nowhere else in the world. In the worst case, this could mean one epidemic with hundreds of thousands of infected and many thousands of dead. For many regions in the Africa south of the Saharan have already great problems: epidemics of malaria, HIV and tuberculosis and an increase in chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension weaken not only people, but overload countries where there are clinics, physicians, nurses and medical care is missing. Even if you are swording with numbers and predictions, many experts have a great fear before this scenario. At the meeting of the Executive Council of the World Health Organization WHO on 3 February, the mood among the African Member States had been very nervous, reports present. And John Nkensgasong, who leads the African Union epidemic authority founded only three years ago, said time online between two telephone conferences: \"We are confronted with an unprecedented danger.\" Even with the SARS epidemic 2003, the states of Africa south of the Sahara were largely spared, only South Africa registered a single case. But in the new coronavirus, nobody should hope that it is so glimated - too closely the connections between China and many African states have become. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese guest workers work on the African continent, thousands of African students travel annually with a university scholarship to China. the air traffic of Africa to China and back \nSustainable in the past ten years. At the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities of the World Health Organization WHO reported an accumulation of pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause in the Central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the diseases. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days then a group released a group of the virologen Christian's premier from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 the first diagnostic test for the new virus, the researcher provisionally call 2019-NCOV. With the test, the virus can be detected in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, on which, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected. Both the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as well as Mers (MIDDLE East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses which have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more than 750 died. With the MERS virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronaviruses. Many of them relate to respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example. In China, several thousand persons are suffering from them, some of them - most of them with pre-existing conditions - have died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first infection cases outside of China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been in Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection with a tourist, who came back from Wuhan, on January 24, the first cases were known in France. Meanwhile, too \nFirst cases in Germany confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. The virus can cause pneumonia that can endally end. Since it is a viral illness, antibiotics do not help. Meanwhile, it is clear that the virus can be transferred from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transfers after a dozen cases were known in medical staff. Medizors assume that the virus is transmitted above all over droplet infection. The World Health Organization calculates, as announced on January 24, at the moment that an infected one cuts 1.4 to 2.5 other people. Contest these numbers, the virus is less contagious than SARS and also the viral flu. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals. That can not be said yet. The World Health Organization said on 28 January that about one-fifth of the reported cases through the virus will be seriously ill, so in case of doubt must be treated intensive care. According to reports, the first death pots were patients who had some severe pre-existing conditions. Even with other infectious diseases, people with pre-existing diseases are particularly endangered - for example at the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so change their genome. This can cause you to become more dangerous for people in the course of an outbreak - but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) expects no similar mortality to the current time as the outbreak of SARS. Many countries of the continent have strong economic relations with China. Kenya and Ethiopia for example. For Ethiopia, China is with one \nTrading volume of more than five billion US dollars of the most important business partners. In Kenya, the Chinese government sponsored one of the largest infrastructure projects in the history of the country, a high-speed train that connects the capital Nairobi with the coastal metropolis of Mombasa. The train is part of the new Silk Road initiative, which called the Chinese President Xi Jinping 2013 into life. In order to build up trading bases worldwide, China invests trillion euros in infrastructure projects. And both in Ethiopia and in Kenya there was several Coronavirus suspected cases last week, says Michel Yao, who is responsible for Emergency programs at the Who Africa for emergency programs. \"We already had many alarms,\" \u200b\u200bsays Yao. But that is a good sign, because it shows that the monitoring systems worked in many places. But that's true? Or are there any cases in individual African states that nobody has registered? A 2019 report of Global Preparedness Monitoring Boards at least found global gaps in preparation for epidemics and an investigation of the Center for Health Security of John's Hopkins University showed: The worst-prepared countries are almost all in Africa. Actually, it is important to everything: on laboratories to prove pathogens, to isolation rooms and staff. But in turn: In order to suffocate an epidemic as possible in the germ, it first needs good reporting systems. Because the faster cases are tracked, the fewer people can infect the infected infected. John Nkensgasong says the African epidemic protection authority has already set up a Taskforce, which the countries should support. In addition, each country should have a quick engaging force, and already wanted today at all airports after infected, with questionnaires and temperature scanners. Such a screening would be due to the Ebola lasting for one and a half \nExhibition in the Congo anyway carried out anyway. How well these measures in the event of a coronafall really grabbing is hard to say. It certainly depends on which country in Subsahara Africa gets to do with the first coronaviruses. Some countries - such as Ghana or Nigeria - are better prepared as regions where war rules and governments are unstable, for example the South Sudan or the Central African Republic. There, for example, the virus is likely to have virtually free train. Also, the finding of new cases will not be easy, says G\u00e9rard Krause from the Helmholtz Center for Infection Research: \"In many parts of Africa, people first think of malaria if someone has a fever.\" It is therefore about school health professionals to train that, in addition to diseases such as malaria, Lassa, Ebola and a meningitis by meningococci, the coronavirus could hide behind a fever thrust. Krause has been helping since 2017 in Nigeria and recently also set up a system in Ghana, which means SORMAS. You have to imagine it as a platform that combines all involved in a health system digital: the laboratory, the district staff, the health helper on the village and the health authority. For example, if a health helper has the suspicion of infection with the new coronavirus, deposited on a tablet and taking a blood sample, explains Krause, different things simultaneously happen: The laboratory will notify that a sample is on the way. The health authorities and the district entertainment get an alarm and the health resin is instructed to isolate suspected cases and looking for people with whom he had to do. If it succeeds in finding suspicion, the question remains as confirmed. In early February, there were only two laboratories throughout Africa, testing samples of patients on the 2019 NCOV virus. the \nSamples of an suspected case in the Ivory Coast had to be sent to Europe only explained Michael Yao, Time Online. It took days to fix: false alarm. In the coming days, twelve laboratories should be able to do the test on the new coronavirus in Subsahara Africa, says Yao. John Nkensgasong assumes that he will soon be available in 15 to 20 countries. Patients to find quickly and then isolate is far more important than elsewhere in wide parts of Africa. For most health systems subshara-africa should be too weak to take care of the suffering with a larger coronavirus outbreak. Catering quarantine stations with ventilation machines, which are used in the case of severe pneumonia by the coronavirus, there is no. In addition, there are sub-sahara Africa's skills shortage in almost all countries. While in Germany is statistically about 42 physicians and doctors to 10,000 people, it is exactly one in Ethiopia, in Somalia even only 0.2 *. In many countries, it is missing on the most elementary, the political scientist Ilona Kickbusch, who advised the Federal Government in global health issues: \"It starts with the protective coat and medicines.\" Also, there are logistical problems in many countries with weak health systems. Respiratory masks, for example, to bring in affected areas, can then take days - far too long for the contagious coronavirus. The weakness of some health systems was also the main reason to exclude an international health care room, said the Director-General of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, on January 30: \"We do not know what to do for damage this virus when it comes to a country propagates with a weaker health system. We have to act now to prepare for this opportunity. \" John Nkensgasong says, \"I can only call the international community to help African countries now - and \nnot to wait is completely overwhelmed continent until. \"an eruption as in china would the health systems of most states not withstand. the Gates Foundation, the millions for years invested in global health, has nkengansongs authority already 4.5 million euros pledged to take action against the new coronavirus. on 05 february declared the foundation then that she wanted to invest a further 90 million euros to combat the coronavirus, about 18 million of them will go to African countries. some African states such as sudan requested on 04 february at the meeting of the exeuktivrates the who explicitly for help. \"it went on the one hand to training courses for the prevention of multiple forces and treatment of coronavirus,\" says mathias bonk by the institute for global health in berlin. and on the other therefore, that they materials such as test kits, masks and protective suits would need. some of these problems to a specially to the new cor onavirus solve tailored strategic plan, which the imagined who this week. john nkengansong of the African epidemic Protection Agency has also spoken world bank with and asked the public health agencies of usa and china logistical help. just the us americans had often helped in recent health crises in sub-Saharan Africa. but what if the usa experience even a severe coronavirus-eruption? also this fear drives currently many around: that the donor countries could be so preoccupied with outbreaks of the virus classic that they no longer help. michel yao says the who-emergency team was also with non-governmental organizations such as the red cross and MSF in contact. could locate in some African states, when they reached virus, benefit from such existing partnerships. in the event events could then for example ebola treatment centers in are converted to locate Congo, where \nPeople with a coronavirus infection are isolated and treated. However, Ilona Kickbusch also emphasizes that it does not need money and relief supplies, but also a strategy on how to explain measures such as quarantine and isolation of patients to people in the affected areas. In the case of past Ebola outbreaks, this turned out to be a problem: men in yellow protective suits, so it must have represented many villagers, came, took healthy people and brought back dead. Of course, conspiracy theories arose what it made the treatment team even heavier to win the trust of the population. G\u00e9rard Krause from the Helmholtz Institute for Infection Research is meanwhile in contact with various African states. They think about using his SORMAS system just like Ghana and Nigeria. There, the system has already helped in 2017 and 2018 to get a monkey block outbreak under control, says Krause. Even if it could be too late for the new coronavirus: a next epidemic with a new pathogen is determined. This should prepare for a closer cross-linked Africa.

"}, {"content": "will china learn from covid-19 epidemic?. when the severe acute respiratory (sars) epidemic ended in 2003, many people in china thought that the government had learned its lesson.   sars was the most serious epidemic the country encountered in the reform era, killing 349 people in china.   the government was roundly criticised for its cover-ups in the early phases of the epidemic, leading to some frantic bureaucratic reshuffles, greater transparency and an expensive control and prevention system for infectious diseases.   in march 2019, director of the chinese center for disease control and prevention gao fu confidently predicted that china would never again suffer from another sars-like epidemic.   mr gao is facing a storm of anger for this prediction since the outbreak in december 2019 of new coronavirus covid-19, which has caused infections and deaths than sars.   as of march 7, according to the world health organization, covid-19 has caused 3,073 deaths and infected 80,813 people in china, with hundreds of thousands more under medical observation.   a medical and humanitarian tragedy has wreaked havoc in wuhan city and hubei province, the epicentre of the epidemic.   a widely circulated social-media article describes 11 striking mistakes china has repeated this time around.   the most grievous failings are the government cover-ups and censorship in the early phases of the epidemic which cost the country a precious three weeks in january to fight the virus.   the most notorious cover-up surrounded dr li wenliang, the now renowned whistle-blower who drew attention to early cases of covid-19 infection.   the police admonished him for warning people about the virus on social media and he later died from the infection himself.   as news of his death began to circulate online on the evening of feb 6 feb, there was an outpouring of mourning and anger \u2014 too much for the censors to manage.   dr li is already a martyr in the eyes of his mourners. but will the present \ncrisis tragically embodied by his death spur china to learn any real lessons?   leaning from history is one of the most difficult skills for humankind to master.   german philosopher hegel once cynically remarked that \u201cthe only thing we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history\u201d.   twentieth-century american philosopher george santayana offered a dark warning that \u201cthose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it\u201d.   the value of historical learning is just as venerated in the chinese tradition. the great 11th-century classic work of chinese historiography comprehensive mirror to aid governance by zi zhi tong jian trawls the entirety of chinese history up to that point for lessons in politics and governance.   courageous chinese intellectuals are signing online letters calling for the authorities to respect freedom of speech, supposedly guaranteed by the country\u2019s constitution.   they believe that if freedom of speech as an individual right were protected, voices like dr li\u2019s would have been heard more widely and effectively, perhaps forestalling the spread. if dr li\u2019s death led to real freedom of speech in china, that would be a lesson well learned.   but there is no sign as yet of such learning taking place. no sooner had demands for freedom of expression gained traction than they too fell victim to censors.   information control is hardening, not loosening. truthful depictions of the tolls of the crisis in wuhan are condemned as rumours and swiftly deleted.   this happened to fang fang, a resident of wuhan and professional writer whose first-hand blogs of the humanitarian disaster unfolding in her city have gripped millions of readers.   the length to which the censors have gone to eliminate dissent is extraordinary. on feb 22, authorities killed an article run by the official xinhua news agency for its assertion that \u201cthe sky is not going to fall upon the telling of truth\u201d.   a more promising avenue for learning is governance reform. \nthis is where most chinese discussions on managing the epidemic are centred.   various experts are weighing in on the need for institutional reform. unlike western commentaries which tend to blame the authoritarian system of president xi jinping, chinese scholars raise a multitude of questions beyond politics.   these include concerns about state\u2013society relations, centre\u2013local relations and the role of social organisations (including non-governmental organisations) and professional groups.   while the rigidity of the chinese system and the consequent governance failure are part of their criticisms, their comments are more nuanced and fine-tuned.   some of these views may reach the very top of the chinese system, but it is unclear how the leadership will learn from this crisis.   there are likely to be plenty of technical fixes, such as those recently announced by president xi.   but will the learning be so deep as to inaugurate systemic governance reforms and ensure long-term progress?   as china continues its fight against covid-19, the best hope is that the country can learn real lessons from this crisis and prove hegel wrong. east asia forum   \u00a0   about the author:   feng zhang is professor of international relations and executive dean of the institute of public policy at the south china university of technology, guangzhou.

The Wuhan Coronavirus has not only left isolated to 46 million people who live in the blocked cities of the Chinese province of Hubei, the focus of the epidemic. After the World Health Organization (WHO) declared on Thursday an international health emergency, it is all of which is increasingly disconnected from the rest of the world. Numerous airlines have rushed to cancel their Chinese routes. Different countries have announced the closure of their borders for those who have been in that country in the last 14 days, including third-country nationals. Within China, the situation that the 2019-NECO has created does not return. The number of infected Rounds 14,380; Mortal victims reach 304; People under observation, 163,000, of which of 19,544 is suspected that they have been infected. The positive news: the number of patients cured, 328, exceeds the deceased. The early morning of this Sunday, the Philippine Department of Health announced the death of a 44-year-old Chinese nationality because of Coronavirus. The outbreak has already reached 24 countries, which accumulate more than 150 cases, including one in Spain. Only Africa and South America are still free of the virus. A situation that, according to the United States, justifies a statement of \"public health emergency\" in its territory. This country - the first announced the repatriation of its citizens in Wuhan after the abrupt closure of that city on day 23- will close its borders to any foreigner who does not have family ties with permanent citizens or residents of the US and who has been in China In the two weeks before arrival, the maximum incubation period. The veto will enter into force on the same Sunday. In addition, US airlines have also announced the temporary suspension of their flights to China. Other countries have done the same. This Saturday multiplied the \nFlight withdrawal ads. To those already known from British Airways, Iberia or Lufthansa joined the Australian Qantas, Vietnamese airlines or Uzbekistan flag companies, Turkmenistan or Iran. Travelers who have passed through China in the last two weeks will not be admitted in nations such as Australia, El Salvador, Mongolia, Italy or Singapore. The measures have caused a profound discomfort in the Chinese government, which tries to tackle the epidemic as soon as possible and without repairing costs. Beijing wants to make clear that errors like the management of SARS - the epidemic similar to the current one who killed almost 800 people around the world in 2003 - will not be repeated. \"It is not necessary that the panic is uselessly necessary, or taking excessive measures,\" the Chinese ambassador in Geneva, Xu Chen, declared at a press conference. WHO, has underlined the diplomat, does not stop emphasizing that he has \"full confidence\" in the capacity of the second economy in the world to resolve the crisis. This UN organization does not consider it necessary to restrict travel or trade with the Asian country. For this country, the closure of borders or the exit in Tropel of the foreigners of Wuhan represents a vote of non-confidence in its control measures and its health system, despite the saturation and lack of protective material that the same government has admitted . In many cases, bureaucratic obstacles have delayed hours or whole days the repatriation flights of foreigners. Despite this, a second plane chartered by France landed this Sunday at the Istres Air Base, in the south of the country, with 250 aliens of 30 different repatriated nationalities from Wuhan, two days after the arrival of the first 180 French citizens from The city identified as the zero zone of the coronavirus. None of the new passengers, 65 French and \"many Europeans\", said the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jean-Yves Le Drian, presented symptoms to the \nTime to board the flight. Nor the first repatriate citizens have developed the disease so far, the Secretary of State Adrien Taquet added. While foreigners had planned to be sent to their countries of origin - among others Belgium, Sweden and Norway - according to an unbalanced protocol, the 65 French will be distributed between the 30-kilometer vacation center of Marseille where the first repatriated and A fire school next to Aix-en-Provence totally isolated and accommodated for your arrival, according to the authorities. To a certain extent, there is no doubt that there is a political component, and not only sanitary, in some of the decisions of closing borders or keeping them open. Despite the numerous recommendations of medical specialists, and having already confirmed 13 cases in its territory, the Hong Kong government has so far refused to completely close the border. Yes it has suspended the ferry connections or high-speed train and reduced the number of flights to mainland China. The medical personnel unions threaten to declare themselves on strike this Monday if the head of the government, Carrie Lam, does not declare a complete closure. Other countries with a great economic dependence on China have been decidedly placed next to this power. Pakistan is reluctant to evacuate his university students in Wuhan, despite the appeals of the students, to show \"solidarity\" the government in Beijing. A similar argument uses the Prime Minister of Cambodia, Hun Sen. At a press conference in Phnom Penh on Thursday he insisted that his nationals in China, including Wuhan, \"have to stay there to help the Chinese people fight this disease. Do not run away from the Chinese people in these difficult times. \" but the measures of the United States, specifically, threaten to open a front more in the difficult relations between the two great powers, which had signed a truce in December \nIn his commercial war that lasted almost two years. Before the announcement of the closure of borders, this week the Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross, assured that the Coronavirus in China benefited the USA while would oblige companies to take their supply chains from the Asian country. \"The words and acts of some American heads or are based on facts or adequate,\" has declared the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hua Chunying, in a statement. \"Just as soon as the WHO was pronounced against travel restrictions, the United States hurried to take the opposite path.

the risk-alert level was raised after several novel coronavirus cases were detected in the republic without any links to previous cases or travel histories to china.   to allay public anxiety, prime minister lee hsien loong made a speech a day after the panic buying, assuring singaporeans that there was no need to panic as the city was not being locked down, and there was ample supply of food for everyone.\u00a0   now that a sense of normalcy has returned, questions remain to be answered: what caused all that panic-buying over that fateful weekend, which had left some quarters fuming \u2014 and embarrassed \u2014 over the behaviour of \u201cugly singaporeans\u201d, and others to question whatever happened to decades of efforts aimed at building a resilient society?   and what does it say about singaporeans, many of whom have stoically and quietly got on with their lives, despite the uncertainty and disruptions to daily life?\u00a0   customers picking out instant noodles and other

singapore, there have been no reports of panic buying in places outside of china.\u00a0 residents in thailand for example, which has 33 confirmed cases as of friday, told today that the situation was calm and there has been no run on daily essentials.   some experts believe that events in hong kong, which was gripped by scenes of panic buying recently, had influenced singaporeans\u2019 behaviour.\u00a0   speaking to today, mr wong bai chun, a hong kong citizen, said that two weeks ago, there was a brief but acute shortage of toilet paper and other paper goods in the territory, which was sparked by an internet rumour that the chinese spring holiday was being extended and there would be insufficient supplies of such products.   other triggers   negativity bias   a spokesperson for the singapore psychological society (sps) council said this is a phenomena where our brains tend to focus more on negative information than positive ones.   \u201cour brains are hardwired to register negative stimuli more readily and also to dwell and worry on them for a longer period of time,\u201d the spokesperson told today.   self-preservation and groupthink   whenever there is a life-threatening epidemic or emergency, the notions of safety, protection, and self-preservation usually come into play.   \u201cresearch suggests that when people are in panic, the thinking part of our brain gets hijacked by the emotional system and we start to act illogically,\u201d said the spokesperson. \u201cour ability to decide on our own is minimised.\u201d   the spokesperson added that people tend to follow others in the hope that the latter could get them out of a dangerous situation.   in singapore\u2019s case, this could be a possible reason why people started to hoard or buy things impulsively if everyone else around them was doing the same, or if they were told to do so on social media platforms.   social-media   mr lars voedisch, the managing \ndirector of public relations firm precious communications, said the panic-buying is triggered by one or two initial incidents which then get amplified by social media.   \u201c(this leads) to a snowball effect of more and more people thinking of it, then hearing from the first people acting on their fear, sharing about it and through that fuelling the whole panic,\u201d he said.   singapore management university sociologist paulin straughan said it did not help that the public was seeing these images circulated on social media late in the night. as a result, these became the abiding images for many singaporeans overnight.\u00a0   \u201cfor the next 12 hours, the shelves remain empty (in their minds),\u201d she said. \u201cand that\u2019s 12 hours of festering, and it entrenches (the fear that there are no supplies).\u201d   agreeing with mr voedisch, she reiterated that while technology has helped to disseminate information a lot faster, it has similarly allowed misinformation to spread just as quickly as well.   this was not something that singaporeans had to worry about during the past virus outbreaks, she added.   empty shelves at fairprice finest in bukit timah plaza on feb 7, after the dorscon alert level was changed to orange. photo: raj nadarajan/today   public comms \u2018could have been better\u2019\u00a0   communications experts told today that the panic-buying in singapore might have been avoided if the information disseminated by the authorities had been clearer.\u00a0\u00a0   \u201cthe problem with the message was that it was too bureaucratic at the start,\u201d said nanyang technological university (ntu) assistant professor liew kai khiun.\u00a0   \u201cmuch of the government\u2019s message involved military terms (and) colour codes,\u201d said asst prof liew, who teaches at the wee kim wee school of communication and information (wkwsci).   prof straughan agreed, noting that the definition of dorscon orange was not explained enough as well.   dorscon is a colour-coded framework that shows the current disease situation.\u00a0   orange refers to a \nsituation in which a virus is spreading in singapore but not widely, and is being contained. previously, the risk assessment level was at yellow, signifying that the virus was severe and could infect from person to person, but was chiefly occurring outside singapore. the highest level, red, indicates that the virus is spreading widely and can result in major disruption such as closing schools.   \u201csome people didn\u2019t know what it meant. all they saw was the visual,\u201d said prof straughan. \u201cthere are four levels. green, yellow, orange and red. red is bad, everybody knows that right? green is good. now orange. it is closer to red than it is to green. so visually, it lights up all your flags.\u201d\u00a0   asst prof liew pointed out while the message from the authorities was accurate, it did not cater to the layman. to that end, they could have used dialect or singlish to reach out more effectively, he noted.\u00a0   during the sars outbreak in 2003, local sitcom character phua chu kang was used to educate singaporeans on the importance of washing their hands.\u00a0 this, he said, was an effective way of reaching out to the public, and many people still remember it today.   a leaked moh press release a few hours before the official dorscon orange announcement, which left many befuddled, might have also fuelled the public panic.\u00a0   the press release was circulated on social media and through messaging platforms such as whatsapp.   up till this incident, prof straughan felt that the government had been doing well in being upfront with singaporeans about the virus situation. but when the press release was prematurely leaked out, it created some confusion.\u00a0   she said it did not help that recipients of the leaked document were initially told by others that it was fake news, only to be informed by the authorities a few hours later that it was indeed true.\u00a0\u00a0   such contradictory information would have led some to question if the authorities were trying to hide something, she said.\u00a0   the \nauthorities have yet to announce the source of the leak, but mr chan said on feb 9 that the various agencies involved in tackling the virus will remind their staff that they have a professional responsibility not to prematurely share information that has not been finalised.   despite these short-comings in public communications, some of the experts felt that mr lee\u2019s nine-minute long speech on feb 8 went some way in restoring some sense of normalcy.\u00a0\u00a0   the sps council spokesperson said mr lee\u2019s message gave people very concrete actions that \u201chanded back a measure of control to people whose sense of control felt threatened\u201d.   mr voedisch\u00a0said having the prime minister step in to address the public helped, because it went beyond technocratic statements and directly addressed what people were concerned with.   \u201cwhile authorities should not get emotional when communicating, they have to be empathetic appealing to the hearts and minds of the audience,\u201d said mr voedisch.   however, he was uncertain if an address by mr lee to the public at an earlier juncture would have helped.\u00a0   instead, he said that the authorities should have foreseen the responses from the public as part of proper scenario planning with \u201cready-to-go action plans\u201d.   also, they should have anticipated and addressed the public\u2019s concerns and fears across the different platforms, he added.\u00a0      prime minister lee hsien loong in a recorded message which was televised a day after singapore raised its dorscon alert level to orange.\u00a0photo: mci   \u200bhere comes the good   still, despite the panic buying grabbing the headlines, mr chan and other government leaders took pains to point out that a large majority of singaporeans had been \u201ccalm and rational\u201d.\u00a0   many singaporeans had come forward to thank the cashiers and supermarket staff constantly working behind the scenes to restock the empty shelves, mr chan noted.\u00a0\u00a0   countless others have also stepped in to do their part for their fellow citizens, with \nnumerous ground-up initiatives started in the community.   for example, today had reported about two primary school girls who used their pocket money to buy and deliver breakfast to doctors and nurses. on valentine\u2019s day which fell on friday, community group standupforsg also gave out \u201clove letters\u201d to frontline healthcare workers.   quiet resilience\u00a0   away from the public spotlight and media glare, ordinary singaporeans have got on with their lives, despite the disruptions and worries brought on by the covid-19 outbreak.\u00a0   scores of singaporeans \u2014 such as taxi and private-hire drivers, as well as those in the retail and tourism industries \u2014 have seen their livelihoods taken a hit. others have had to adjust to working from home as business continuity plans swung into place.   cleaners, for example, are putting in longer hours while healthcare workers not only have to work longer each day but are also putting themselves at risk on the frontlines.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0   a 23-year-old outbreak nurse who works with covid-19 patients said that while her family understands the risks of her occupation, it does not stop them from worrying.\u00a0   \u201cmost nurses are worried too, but it\u2019s our job and this is what we do for a living,\u201d said the nurse, who wanted to be known only as sharmaine due to the sensitivity of her role.   when she was first assigned to handle suspected covid-19 cases, sharmaine said she was scared as no one knew what exactly they were dealing with.\u00a0   \u201cbut over time, i grew immune to it, even if a patient were to test positive for the virus. now i don't feel so scared anymore.\u201d   however, she feels disappointed at the discrimination against healthcare workers shown by some singaporeans, even as many others expressed gratitude for their work.   \u201cit truly is demoralising when you hear of such incidents. we feel ostracised at times because all we want to do is perform our job and go home,\u201d she said. \u201cbut we continue to keep an open mind because we are the first line of \ndefence.\u201d   some businesses have had to adjust their operating models due to the outbreak.   ms jazz chong, the owner and director of contemporary gallery ode to art, has noticed fewer people visiting the gallery as well as the raffles city shopping centre, where the gallery is located.\u00a0\u00a0   \u201cwith the virus outbreak becoming more severe, we have now decided to take the extra measure of bringing the art to our clients directly,\u201d she said. \u201cif they like the work then it can remain in their home, making it extra convenient for them as they do not even have to leave their house.\u201d   business owners like ms chong are hoping that people would continue life as normal, albeit taking the necessary precautions.\u00a0   or as ntu\u2019s asst prof liew put it: \u201cwe must have a courageous sense of normality and go on living life normally.\u201d\u00a0   indeed, prime minister lee noted on friday that the covid-19 outbreak is expected to last longer than sars, with a greater impact already hitting the economy.   but he stressed: \u201cwe have to keep singapore going and we have to keep making a living. life has to go

announcement aboard the diamond princess, where 3,700 passengers and crew have been held since feb. 3, told americans to get ready to disembark on sunday evening for charter flights home. passengers wearing masks could later be seen waving through the windows of buses parked near the ship. of the roughly 400 americans on the cruise, more than 40 are infected with the virus and will stay in japan

outside china. fauci told the washington post there were 44 infected americans. within china, authorities reported 2,009 new cases on sunday, noting that this was down from more than 2,600 the previous day. they said this showed their efforts to halt the spread of the virus were bearing fruit. \u201cthe \neffect of the coronavirus controls is appearing,\u201d mi feng, spokesman for the health commission, told reporters. the new cases brought the total to 68,500 in mainland china, with 1,665 deaths, including 143 fatalities reported on sunday. outside china, more than 500 cases have been confirmed, mostly of people who traveled from chinese cities, with five deaths. the coronavirus is thought to have emerged at a wildlife market in china\u2019s central province of hubei. china\u2019s response has included putting hubei and its capital wuhan - a city of 11 million people - on virtual lockdown. mi said the proportion of confirmed cases who were critically ill had fallen to 21.6% on saturday, from 32.4% on jan. 27. he said this showed the authorities were able to treat patients more quickly, preventing cases from becoming critical. mark woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at britain\u2019s university of edinburgh, said if the numbers suggested the epidemic has peaked in hubei, \u201cthen this would be encouraging news for the rest of the world too\u201d. but he added: \u201cwe should be cautious though; it could simply be that reporting is not keeping up with events in circumstances where the health services are under enormous pressure.\u201d declining numbers of reported new infections could mean the virus was being contained, but could also mean it was simply running out of susceptible new hosts in wuhan, he said. restrictions were tightened further in hubei on sunday with vehicles, apart from essential services, banned from the roads and companies told to stay shut until further notice. after an extended lunar new year holiday, china urgently needs to get back to work. but in some cities streets are still deserted. on board the diamond princess, american passenger matthew smith posted a photo on twitter

the ship, owned by carnival corp., has been held in the port of yokohama and those with the disease have been taken to hospital onshore. no one from the ship has died. countries that have announced plans to fly their citizens home from the ship say they will take them only if they are symptom-free, and quarantine them on arrival. the u.s. department of defense is preparing to receive two flights with passengers - one to land at travis air force base, california and the other at kelly field/lackland air force base in texas. the evacuees will be subject to a 14-day quarantine. another cruise

"}, {"content": "a third of coronavirus cases may be \u2018silent carriers\u2019, classified chinese data suggests. hong kong \u2014 the number of \"silent carriers\"\u00a0\u2014 people who are infected by the new coronavirus but show delayed or no symptoms\u00a0\u2014 could be as high as one-third of those who test positive, according to classified chinese government data seen by the south china morning post.   that could further complicate the strategies being used by countries to contain the virus, which has infected more than 280,000 people and killed nearly 13,000 globally.   more than 43,000 people in china had tested positive for covid-19 by the end of february but had no immediate symptoms, a condition typically known as asymptomatic, according to the data. they were placed in quarantine and monitored but were not included in the official tally of confirmed cases, which stood at about 80,000 at the time.   scientists have been unable to agree on what role asymptomatic transmission plays in spreading the disease. a patient usually develops symptoms in five days, though the incubation period can be as long as three weeks in some rare cases.   one obstacle is that countries tally their confirmed cases differently.   the world health organisation classifies all people who test positive as confirmed cases regardless of whether they experience any symptoms. south korea also does this. but the chinese government changed its classification guidelines on feb 7, counting only those patients with symptoms as confirmed cases. the united states, britain and italy simply do not test people without symptoms, apart from medical workers who have prolonged exposure to the virus.   the approach taken by china and south korea of testing anyone who has had close contact with a patient\u00a0\u2014 regardless of whether the person has symptoms\u00a0\u2014 may explain why the two asian countries seem to have checked the spread of the virus. hong kong is extending testing to airport arrivals in the city, even if travellers have no symptoms. meanwhile in \nmost european countries and the us, where only those with symptoms are tested, the number of infections continues to rapidly rise.   a growing number of studies are now questioning the who's earlier statement that asymptomatic transmission was \"extremely rare\". a report by the who's international mission after a trip to china estimated that asymptomatic infections accounted for 1 to 3 per cent of cases, according to a european union paper.   \"the number of novel coronavirus (covid-19) cases worldwide continues to grow, and the gap between reports from china and statistical estimates of incidence based on cases diagnosed outside china indicates that a substantial number of cases are underdiagnosed,\" a group of japanese experts led by mr hiroshi nishiura, an epidemiologist at hokkaido university, wrote in a letter to the international journal of infectious diseases in february.   based on their research, mr nishiura put the proportion of asymptomatic japanese patients evacuated from wuhan, ground zero of the outbreak in china, at 30.8 per cent\u00a0\u2014 similar to the classified chinese government data.   but official figures from south korea\u00a0\u2014 which had carried out nearly 300,000 tests on all close contacts of its confirmed cases as of wednesday \u2014 are the most comparable to china's. more than 20 per cent of the asymptomatic cases reported to the korea centres for disease control and prevention remained without symptoms until they were discharged from hospital.   \"korea currently has a significantly higher rate of asymptomatic cases than other countries, perhaps due to our extensive testing,\" ms jeong eun-kyeong, director of south korea's cdc, told a press briefing on march 16.   another useful point of reference is the data collected from the diamond princess cruise ship, which was quarantined for weeks in yokohama, japan. all of its passengers and crew were tested, with 712 people testing positive\u00a0\u2014 334 of whom were asymptomatic, according to official japanese figures.   an \neu report has put the proportion of asymptomatic cases in italy at 44 per cent, but in most parts of the country people without symptoms are not tested.   in hong kong, 16 of the 138 confirmed cases as of march 14 were asymptomatic or presymptomatic, according to mr ho pak-leung, a professor with the microbiology department of the university of hong kong.   all of these numbers point to a significantly higher ratio of asymptomatic cases than indicated by data publicly released by china so far. there were 889 asymptomatic patients among the 44,672 confirmed cases as of february 11, epidemiologists from the chinese centre for disease control and prevention wrote in a paper published online in jama network open on february 24.   the who has said the role of asymptomatic transmissions in the spread of the disease was not clear, but carriers without symptoms were unlikely to be a key factor overall.   however, some scientists are asking whether asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmissions have been underestimated.   a joint study by experts in china, the us, britain and hong kong estimated that undocumented cases of the pneumonia, mostly with mild or even no symptoms, were the source of infection for 79 per cent of documented ones before wuhan was locked down on jan 23.   \"these undocumented infections often experience mild, limited, or no symptoms and hence go unrecognised, and, depending on their contagiousness and numbers, can expose a far greater portion of the population to the virus than would otherwise occur,\" the specialists from columbia university, the university of hong kong, imperial college london, tsinghua university, and the university of california, davis wrote in the report.   a separate study by scientists from the university of texas at austin estimated that people who had not yet developed symptoms transmitted around 10 per cent of the 450 cases they studied in 93 chinese cities. their findings are awaiting publication in the journal emerging \ninfectious diseases.   mr ho from the university of hong kong said some asymptomatic patients had a viral load similar to those with symptoms.   \"of course it is hard to say if they may be less infectious if they don't cough. but there are also droplets when you speak,\" he said, referring to how the respiratory virus is transmitted.   mr benjamin cowling, an epidemiology and biostatistics professor at the university of hong kong, said there was \"clear evidence that infected persons could transmit infection before symptoms appear\".   \"there are many reports of transmission around one to two days before symptom onset,\" he said.   a better understanding of asymptomatic cases could lead to adjustments in public health policy, experts said.   \"the asymptomatic ratio ... could be higher among children than in older adults,\" mr nishiura wrote in the international journal of infectious diseases. \"that would considerably change our scope of the outbreak, and even the optimal interventions can change.\" south china morning post "}, {"content": "Maskendiplomatie.

Not without adding, after the pandemic one should think about more intensive cooperation.\nIn a telephone conversation with Italy's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Xi voice from a \"Silk Road of Health\" as part of China's \"One Belt, One Road\" initiative. A clear indication that the help for distressing Europeans also has a geopolitical aspect (which, of course, will no less valuable). The Chinese Silk Road Initiative is predominantly critical in Europe, as expansionism and as a way to drive the participating countries into the debt dependence of China. The picture should now brighten and forget that the Corona crisis had started with China's inactivity and veil tactics.\nThe fact that China currently drives mass production of protective masks in unexpected heights to provide the material worldwide is prominent in propaganda. \"Trump can not keep his mask promise without Chinese factories,\" tones the websites of the regime. It is even scattered that the virus comes from the US - a baffling plump response to the experiments of the American President, with formulations such as \"Chinese virus\" to instrumentalize the health disaster for nationalist purposes.\nOtherwise, China is full of humanity as a friendly great power. And that depends. For example, the Old Allied Serbia, whose President Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 is quoted with the following statement: \"The European solidarity is not available. It is an ammetical tale. We set our hope into the only country that is able to get us in this difficult situation Help: The People's Republic of China. \"\nHe meets a sensitive point. Did not Germany first banned the export of respiratory protective masks to Italy, and is not it so that a few kilometers from the distressing Alsace removes German intensive care units free capacities? And what has become of America, the land of carepackets and raisin bombers?\nChina wants to take this role. Refractors, with all equal in the world. This is the \"Chinese dream of the big national Renaissance\", the solution Xi Jinpings. For millennia, such a solution is issued in China for domination periods, which should give their name to the respective era. The concept of Chinese renaissance has a century tradition, but now it should be so far under the leadership of the KP China.

In the worst scenario, \"I do not know if flu, but it will reduce speed.\" For the President of the Portuguese Travel and Tourism Agencies (APAVT) Association, Pedro Costa Ferreira, in an interview with the public / Renaissance, which may listen to complete this Thursday from 13h, with regard to the new coronavirus, the important They are the \"figures\" and the \"facts\", follow the advice on travelers from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the World Health Organization indications. The rest is \"noise,\" he says, remembering that, taking China and part of Italy, there is no limitation on travel. Since last weekend that there is literally panic in Europe, the number of affected countries is growing. France, Italy, now Spain, talks about many canceled flights, many customers who do not know whether or not they should keep their travels. Is alarmism or is it enough to shake the sector? It's a bit all this. It is a little panic, of ignorance of the facts, but also a little of the sector to be shaken. I have the feeling that the first thing we have to do before starting to talk about coronavirus is to get out of the \"disco\", there's a lot of noise. The media circus that is mounted around this theme has produced a huge noise and this noise has hampered the configuration, framing, relativization of any problem. Let's set up the problem out of the noise: what we have to date today and knowing that numbers are very dynamic. About 80,000 infected, about 2700 dead, which indicates a frankly low mortality rate, especially compared to other similar events that had higher mortality rates. We have almost 30,000 patients cured or recovered from the infection, something that the media circus never points out. This Tuesday was looking at a television that spoke of 80,000 infected, 2700 dead and nothing else. It must be added: and 30,000 recovered. And then there is to relativize and frame. per \nYear in Portugal should die about 3,000 people [of flu], per year in Italy - where we count, at the moment we are talking, 12 dead - die about 8 thousand people in the flu. Does this mean that we have no problem? Surely no. We have to frame it. I understand that you want to sereno, being the president of APAVT, but Tuesday we heard a world specialist who has returned from China to say that the world is not prepared for such a thing. If the world is not prepared according to a specialist, it may be good the sector to prepare yourself. But I'm not saying that the sector is not prepared. First, I am relativizing and moving away the circus. Let's talk about numbers. This is not to say we do not have a problem. But what is the main problem for already? It is the lack of knowledge of the virus, its way of transmission, its consequences, its moment of transmission, whether seasonal or throughout the year, is unpredictability. It is the unpredictability that causes this chaos and panic. For this unpredictability I think there is a path, or several. I think there is a path that is right, the rationality, the prudence, and I would even say that of humility. Rationality: Let's study, let's keep up, let's check the numbers, how's it streaming, where this will stop. For example, in China recoveries are happening at a much higher pace than new infected ones, it's a good thing. But in Europe we are starting a transmission process that will probably be aggravated in the next few days, which is a bad thing. We must have some humility regarding this lack of knowledge. It is a certainty that within two months, most likely, we are not all stuck at home without living, but we can be with our lives relatively affected. It is also maybe a certainty that we will not have a normal life, but we can have a very close life of normal. And if we have a \nJourney already bought for China? If I have a trip to fifteen days from now, I bought a travel agency, is the agency available to reimburse me from the trip? Not available, you are legally and already. But this for all year or short-term? Speaking of repayments must be on a case-by-case basis. But there are some cases that we can determine. Reservations conducted before the outbreak of the problem, which will be traveled by the end of March, can be reimbursed, are legally framed. In June, maybe can not be reimbursed already, we have to wait for evolution. And when do you consider the outbreak of the problem? I think it's December 31. One thing is certain, a trip that was reserved yesterday is not entitled to refund today. Even because a book reserved yesterday had to have on the part of the travel agent, and that's what they dictate the good practices of the travel agency, all the information to the customer. The customer will aware of what he will find. And reserved for eight days for Italy? At this time it is early to say. If it is north of Italy, including Milan, it is very likely that the answer is a refund. It is likely - but, once again, it has to be on a case-by-case basis. When the reservation was made, what is the goal, why is it that the person wants to cancel. If it's just a flight you're not entitled to reimbursement, you have at least two services purchased from a travel agency. Only flight has no right to refund. Never? Not for China? Legally, it is not framed. What is framed by the Law of Travel Agencies is two services sold at the same time, flight hotel, the most transfer flight. What we call organized trips. We continue to speak short term, that is, still in the \"wait to see\", both by the association, and the agencies themselves. The decisions referred to are an association advice to all agencies or each agency can otherwise decide? It is more than that. In the case of China, it is a case of force majeure, there is a \nDeconsing in the Communities Portal, so if the trip is organized, and with more than one service, it is entitled to repayment. And it is necessary to say that travel agencies are very prepared for this because they have insurance. A trip to Italy, today, for Milan, if it was reserved before the infosion of the problem and if it will be traveled until the end of March, this trip, organized and reserved at a travel agency, [is framed]. If it was reserved outside an agency is not framed, it has no protection. The problems of travel agencies today are also the opportunities for travel agencies. It is in an agency that the consumer has greater protection. Between reason and some alarmism, which is natural, because we look at our interactive map on the public site, in which we see each case to emerge and the cases approach and surround Portugal, people naturally enter some alarm . Will there be people already canceling travel even for Europe, with fear of coronavirus? Do these people have the right to cancel the trip already? I would like to take advantage of alarm, with or without reason, that someone has the duty here to cite the World Health Organization: the current situation asks for facts, does not ask for fear; Ask for science, do not ask for rumors; Ask for solidarity, do not ask for stigma. We started to have the Chinese stigma, probably at the end of this process let's thank them the way they solved their problem. would you like that in portugal was happening something, that the government had already adopting preventive measures, something like that? Let's talk about the effect: at the macroeconomic level, to date today, if we talk about travel, I think the effect is not significant For the sector, there was an effect on travel to China, which ended up, on China's trips here, which ended up. This is the effect until last week. And what was the greatest effect? The Chinese who did not come? After all, the Chinese who did not come. despite the market \nChinese emitter is important, being growing, has a quota less than 2.5% in the Portuguese market. And therefore had the effect he had, it is a period, let's see when they return. And if we talk to China destination, it still has less effect. Because it is not a very important destination in the Portuguese market and because this moment is not a very important time of holidays of the Portuguese. Of course there are problems. If you ask China there are no bookings? '- Of course there are no reservations at this time, there are cancellations, there will still be some cancellations. for Italy, are we waiting for bookings this week? Surely there are no bookings this week for Italy, it seems logical. Will there be cancellations? There will be a lot of dialogue, \"Can I go?\", \"Should I go\"?, \"Should I change destiny?\", \"Can I change tall?\", \"Can I wait to see?\", \"Until height I can wait before of having or not paying something without refund? \"There is all this dialogue, but all this dialogue does not include new reserves. Do we have a problem for Easter? It seems reasonable to say yes, that the sector will have a problem at Easter. The major reservations start now during March, Easter is in April and a peak of reserves is not expected with all this environment, which has not yet reached its peak. And the Easter effect? The Easter effect will have a negative effect on the sector. Because obviously if there are no reservations and there are no trips there will be fewer recipes, less invoicing. Is the Easter worth as in the sector? Let's imagine that the crisis worsens even Easter, does that mean what? Easter even for leisure is an important point. Let's say it's still not critical. If we recover until the summer - and we had other epidemics in that two months later things were clarified - I think that if we have a normal summer, the effects will feel, but they will not be so significant. Can you count? I can not give an exact number. It is still possible to think of a non-absolutely negative year, but \nWe will lose opportunities at Easter and the summer we will see.

We are, as I said, in the area of \u200b\u200bunpredictability, we do not know what will happen in the next few days in the coming weeks. If it was my travel agent and I arrived at this point and asked \"I'm thinking of traveling Spain, France, Italy, I do not know, for Easter, for the summer, I do not know. Is it worth making the trip? What right do I have to cancel? \"We have to have some organization here, would not say cool, but at least mental. We have to follow and we follow with very rigor the information of the portal of the communities, these are the basis of existence or not of a legal possibility of reimbursement, if the communities portal does not advise the trip for a certain region or advises. The great truth is that the portal today, because of coronavirus, does not advise to China and north of Italy and Milan, some Southern areas, for young people. Outsides these two regions, today there is no limitation to travel. The Ministers of Health of Italy and the countries that with Italy borders gathered and decided that borders remain open. WHO says there are no restrictions on travel or trade. Passing to tourism as a spring of growth in recent years, still with coronavirus: if this crisis reaches the summer, or extend beyond the summer, do you think the engine of our growth flu? I do not know if flu, but it will reduce speed. In the worst scenarios, the whole world economic model will have difficulties. At the outset, and ahead of all, tourism, because it is the circulation of people and therefore if tourism will have difficulties in worse scenarios, also in Portugal we will have a reduction of speed. I'm not saying it's going to happen. In the worst scenario, or in several more negative scenarios, surely yes.

"}, {"content": "getting ready for covid-19.  a recent sunday afternoon at the bangalore international centre featured dastangoi (storytelling), an avant garde dance performance and an uplifting talk on improving public education. the thursday of gautam menon's talk on covid-19 in late february is also a busy one that coincides with the opening day of an exhibition of artisanal work inspired by mahatma gandhi. as soon as menon, a professor of biology and physics at ashoka university and a leading authority on the spread of viruses, has tested the audio-visual system, i ask him if the government's public campaigns on how to avoid becoming infected have been too muted. \"you have to balance the fact that you don't want to scare the public,\" he says, before going on to say that the public health messaging on adopting different types of behaviour such as, say, not shaking hands had been inadequate. in the past few days as the numbers of infected in india have escalated, there has been a greater sense of urgency. \"the pm cancelling his attendance at holi functions sends out the right message,\" menon said in an e-mail. one of the problems for health officials worldwide in slowing the infections is that the symptoms do not show for several days. this makes isolating the infected quickly and tracing people they have been in contact with extremely difficult when compared with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) outbreak that infected 8,000 people and killed 800 in 2003. temperature tests at airports have proved inadequate, leading to long quarantines that may need to be even longer. \"the medical science is still to be established; 14 to 21 day (quarantines) is probably optimal,\" he says. globally, covid-19 has been less lethal than sars or the middle east respiratory syndrome (mers), but it has been incredibly virulent. in addition to droplets from coughs and sneezes, a less typical mode of transmission could be faecal-oral because the virus has been found in stool samples, which \n\"would be a problem in a country with poor sanitation like ours\".  tea for attendees is laid on by the bic, and is a choice of tea and 'instant' true south filter coffee decoction and salty biscuits. menon, who worked at chennai's institute of mathematical sciences before joining ashoka, is quickly surrounded by friends from academia. as menon's lecture begins, he seems an academic who, like the dastangoi artistes, dispenses wisdom through storytelling. menon then details how the first victim from korea travelled across the middle east before returning home and infecting his wife, people who had visited him in the hospital and other visitors to the hospital. a rapid history of viruses, before pausing to reflect on the spanish flu in 1918-1919, which infected 500 million worldwide and killed 17 million in india, follows. \"infectious disease is a given of humankind. there will always be another around the corner.\" a poster of the hollywood film contagion pops up on a slide. \"it's not a bad film,\" he says -- in case we wish to download it that evening. the covid-19 belongs to the family of coronaviruses that is \"the second leading cause of the common cold\", he says. he then briskly explains why sars and covid-19 originated in wet markets in china: the killing of animals and sloshing of water on the floors to clean up the blood allowed a mixing of fluids and made it easier for the virus to \"spillover\" from species such as civet cats, bats and pangolins to human beings. menon enthuses about the \"groovy nature\" of studying viruses because this spans virology, geopolitics and mathematics. menon uses numbers to highlight that the disease is progressing rapidly into a pandemic, but also to reassure the audience that the chances of dying from it is \"minimal\". the fatality rate of 2 per cent to 3 per cent is well below that of mers, which was as high as 37 per cent, and of sars at 10 per cent. the covid-19 death rate also obscures that the elderly suffer much higher fatality \nrates (15 per cent). \"children tend to be hardly affected,\" he tells me.  demystifying the epidemic, he debunks the effectiveness of masks when worn by the average person. \"the mask has to be worn and taken off in a specific way and one should take care not to touch it. (it provides) more psychological than real protection.\" american doctors on twitter have argued that the stampede to buy masks by people not trained to use them will leave medical personnel on the frontline short of them. on stage, menon regrets not having a bowl to demonstrate how thoroughly one has to scrub one's hands -- on both sides, fingernails included and all the way up to the elbow. in a country where public toilets are often devoid of soap and people eat with their hands, this seems of mission-critical importance. a canadian public official has likened it to washing one's hands as if one had chopped chillies and was about to put on contact lenses.  how prepared is india? the first health system to be tested was kerala's, which, menon points out, enjoys immense public trust. this is required when administering stay-at-home rules or quarantines such as those seen in china, where 60 million people were in lockdown for a month after the outbreak was made public on january 23. people accept these extraordinary conditions for the most part, he observes, when such rules are perceived to be \"for the greater good and everyone is seen to suffer equally. one analogy could be demonetisation\". while kerala dealt with the nipah virus effectively and india handled the quarantines of returnees from wuhan well, \"the number of cases was small\". a wuhan-sized outbreak involving tens of thousands would likely overwhelm india. china has many more doctors and hospital beds relative to its population than india and is a single-party government administered by technocrats. \"even the chinese system was creaking at the seams,\" he says.  india's high levels of pollution leave large numbers battling coughs. coughs in \nthe audience punctuate menon's talk, and he himself was suffering from one. this is an additional challenge for overloaded hospitals in india. \"respiratory distress as one possible symptom of the coronavirus infection in a country that contains 18 of the 20 world's most polluted cities, isn't particularly useful,\" he wryly points out. after questions about how long a vaccine might take and whether covid-19 came from a biological warfare lab, which menon dismisses, the talk is wrapped up. menon is surrounded by people who want the professor to play doctor. is it safe to fly? (yes.) are vegetarians immune? would cow urine help?...  menon is taken for a brisk tour of the centre. in an illustration of the energetic private sector/appalling public infrastructure dichotomy that characterises bengaluru especially, i am pursued by mosquitoes from the stinky nallah nearby and dust from a giant construction site as my uber taxi drives away. the philanthropy of nandan and rohini nilekani and corporate managerial smarts has made the bic a unique place. bengaluru, however, is characterised by dust pollution that rivals delhi's as the city's pavements and roads are dug up in a manner that suggests an earthquake has struck. this has created a slow-motion crisis of recurrent coughs, asthma and lung ailments. with the covid-19 epidemic upon us, years of apathy about pollution may have handicapped india's ability to fight it.

"}, {"content": "Lung disease in China: What travelers need to know. In China, more and more cases of fatal lung disease occur. With the currently running travel wave to the Chinese New Year Festival next Saturday (January 25), the risk of transfer is growing. At the greatest annual migration, a few hundred million Chinese are on the way. In the fight against propagation, the Chinese capital Beijing has now deleted all major events and temple festivals on the occasion of the Chinese New Year. The municipal tourism authority informed that \"the collections of people should be reduced\". Health is priority. The statement applies from immediately and also concerns traditional fairs in the temples of the capital, which usually take place over the two weeks of New Year celebrations. The Emperor's Palace and parts of the great wall are closed from Saturday for visitors. This is affected by the tourist wall portion Badaling in the north of Beijing. China's health commission declared the initial infections were associated with a now closed fish market in Wuhan, where wildlife were sold. Most of the infections continued to focus on the 11 million metropolis. In the fight against a dissemination of lung disease, strict movement restrictions for around 37 million people have been adopted in the seriously affected Central Chinese Province of Hubei. When the most recent three metropolises were stopped in Jingzhou (5.6 million inhabitants), Xiaogan (5 million) and in Dangyang (470,000) public transport and trains to other places, as the city governments reported. Thus, with the provincial capital Wuhan at least eleven cities have been practically chamfered. Coronaviruses often cause harmless diseases such as colds - analyzes of the ergot had the Berlin virus researcher Christian \nHowever, it shows that the pathogen is a SARS variant. SARS stands for \"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\", ie heavy acute respiratory syndrome. A SARS virus had resulted in a worldwide pandemic with 8,000 infected from China, starting with 8,000 people, about 800 people. At Frankfurt Airport, travelers from and travelers are enlightened to the region near Wuhan about the symptoms and how to deal with it, a spokesman for the health department in Frankfurt explained. This happens about large information boards at the airport or on the website of the Foreign Office. \"You just have to look at how the events developed globally and then of course we have to adapt the information,\" explained the speaker. Currently travel and behavioral recommendations are sufficient. In the case of justified suspected cases, affected people would be isolated as well as being observed, it was said from the Office. German tour operators and Lufthansa are in exchange with the authorities because of the spread of the new lung disease in China. \"The organizers keep close contact with the Foreign Office and observe the development,\" said a spokeswoman of the industry association DRV. According to a speaker, Lufthansa noocuts no restraint of customers at the bookings. You can always start planned emergency measures at any time, said the speaker. According to own information, the German industry prime of TUI currently has very few guests in China. \"Accordingly, we currently have no increased information needs,\" said a spokeswoman. Guests were informed on site via SMS on the travel and safety instructions of the Foreign Office. For tourism, only a few requests from customers to the Corona virus went according to their own information. Even the organizer Berge & Sea has not yet recorded any increased queries or cancellation requests. China travelers can leave their flat rate \nNot alone for fear of new lung disease cancel free. A resignation from the travel contract purely fear is currently not possible without cancellation fees, explains the travel right expert Sabine Fischer-People from the law firm Karimi in Berlin. \"One exception only then would if a quarantine measure would be proclaimed for a concrete destination or hotel, so you can not vacation there or only with major restrictions,\" says the lawyer. This is not the case right now. Fischer-Volk advises China travelers to inform themselves regularly about the travel and safety instructions of the Foreign Office (AA). This advises currently not from China travel - an important condition to cancel a flat-rate holiday free of charge. In the travel and safety instructions it is only: \"Avoid contact with sick people and all animals, avoid markets with animal products and pay attention to their hand hygiene.\" Besides, travelers should immediately become a doctor if they have fever and signs of a Develop airway infection. Individual travelers who do not want to fly can not be reimbursed by the airline. For the time being, the EU Prevention Authority ECDC sees a moderate risk that the pathogen is introduced into the European Union. This shared the European Center for Prevention and Control of Diseases in Swedish Solna. To protect against the lung disease North Korea closed according to travel agencies for the time being its limits for foreign tourists. North Korea Lasse No tourists arriving since Wednesday (January 22nd), the agencies-based agencies of Young Pioneer Tours and Koryo Tours said to their websites. From North Korea, there was no official confirmation. China's Asian neighbors, the USA and Great Britain have meanwhile introduced fever controls on the entry from Wuhan because of the lung disease.

There are currently 60 million Italians under a tight quarantine. A closed country at home that can only go out by \"proven motives of health or work\", as dictated the decree of the Giuseppe Government Count. They are extreme measures to try to lock the progression of the new coronavirus, because in 17 days Italy went from having three patients diagnosed with Covid-19 and became the country with the largest number of cases and deaths outside China: 17,660 and 1266, respectively . As if the pressure that these numbers put in the health system and the government was not enough, Italy is also facing an above-average lethality rate - about 7% of the infected population (or at least diagnosed) has already died. At 31 January 2020 the first cases were identified in two Chinese tourists visiting Rome. And this number remained stable for weeks, with the authorities to try to perceive the course of the infected in Italy. only almost 20 days later, on February 22, the first case of internal contamination in a city is about 60 kilometers from Milan: the small codogno, in northern Italy, confirmed six cases of infection by the new coronavirus and decided to All public and private places, including schools, services and supermarkets. The next day, the \"alarms\" sounded again: the Italian authorities confirmed two deaths by coronavirus and about six dozen of new infections, when 24 hours before there were less than ten confirmed cases. And since that day the numbers do not stop multiplying. The regions of northern Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia Romagna are being the most affected by the outbreak - 85% of the infected ones are from that region, which registers about 90% of the deaths. But the virus has already been confirmed in all 20 regions of the country. This Thursday, the count of the outbreak of the new Coronavirus rose 250, to \n1266 deaths. The total number of cases increased to 17,660, compared to 15.113 on Thursday, a rise of 16.8%. It is the largest daily rise in absolute numbers as long as the contagion accelerated. In order to have evolved in such a quick way, the Italian authorities believe that the new coronavirus entered the country long before the first case has been detected, as Time Flavia Riccardo magazine, investigator of the Department of Infectious Diseases of the National Institute Health from Italy. \"All this happened exactly when we were dealing with our flu peak, when citizens had symptoms of this pathology,\" she says. Still before the confirmation of the first cases, there were an abnormally high number with pneumonia in a hospital in codogno and these health facilities may have become infection foci. As the virus spread for a few weeks without being detected, the authorities believe that this can be one of the reasons they explain why italian numbers in covid-19 are so high. \"At the moment we realize [the disease], there were already many active transmission chains,\" says researcher to the team. In addition, advancing the specialist, Italy may have a greater number of cases registered as a result of stricter testing than the remaining countries: has already tested more than 40,000 people. However, this does not explain the lethality. For now, the pattern of deaths registered in Italy is similar to that verified in China. They are the elderly and with associated diseases such as cancer, diabetes, respiratory diseases and others that depress the immune system that are being more affected. According to revealed the National Institute of Health, the average of the ages of patients with coronavirus that died in Italy is 81 years. But the numbers are high: Germany, with 2369 infected sum only five dead, while Italy, with a similar number (2502 to 4 March) already registered \n80; Spain has 4209 cases and 120 deaths, while Italy with 4636 cases (on 7 March) had 197 deaths. As you already knew, the elderly are one of the groups particularly susceptible to the virus and Italy has the most aged population in Europe, with 23% 65 years or older. In world terms, it is only outdated by Japan. But can this help explain such a high number of deaths? Constantine Sakellarides, former General Director of Health, Jubilant Professor of the National School of Public Health and Current Member of the National Public Health Council, explains that the Italian case may be related to the fact that Northern Italy is one of the more regions \" prosperous \"in the world. \"It's not by chance this happened in Milan and not in Lisbon. have to do with the intense relationships that China maintains with the most developed business nuclei in the world, among these Milan, \"says the specialist, highlighting that, however, the fact that northern Italy is a rich region makes it Very well served in terms of health services. On the virus-associated deaths and recorded to date in the country, in particular among the older persons, the public health specialist prefers to focus on the method of calculating the deaths. \"It is difficult to associate the deaths in Italy only to an aged population, and we can not speak of mortality rate, but rather at lethality rate. The first is the number of dead in the population and the second are the victims in the infected population. When we say 6%, we are talking about 6% of patients and not 6% of the Italian population, since this would be a catastrophe, \"explains the former General Health Director. Constantine Sakellarides argues that the situation in Italy is \"dramatic\", but it is difficult to base it only on the aging of citizens, because South Korea or Japan are so (or more) aged. According to the latest data disclosed, South Korea registers, so far, 7979 confirmed cases and 66 deaths, and Japan detected 639 cases and 16 \ndeaths. The specialist rejects Italy as a special case compared to the other exporting countries of the new coronavirus and considers that the Italian case, the most serious epidemic case outside China, relates to \"loss of containment capacity.\" In the light of the recent measures taken by the Italian Government, in a unimpeded effort to contain the virus, Constantine Sakellarides explains that while other countries have had time to learn and study the way SARS-COV-2 is transmitted, Italy did not have that luck . \"We, like other countries, have already had more than two months from Chinese experience and other weeks of Italian experience to deal with the virus. Chinese measurements were very muscled, and most countries are not able to implement such efforts, \"explains the public health specialist. \"Italy did not have the benefit of learning from other countries without being China and I have the impression that it acted later; Hence now several countries are acting earlier, as is the case of Portugal. \" According to the specialist, this virus, due to its transmissibility and its incubation period, is circulating much faster than it seems. \"There is a small increase at first and then an exponential increase, as we have seen in several countries, such as Spain, Denmark and Italy itself. We took the decision to close many public spaces and schools to the 80 cases, Denmark at 500, and Spain to the 2000. Although \"benefit\" is a dangerous word at this time, we have been able to benefit from the examples and make a decision of these much before Of others \", believes the former consultant of the former Minister of Health. \"And we can not forget that social pressure also has a lot of impact on these political decisions to close schools and other public spaces.\" According to a published study this Friday in the scientific journal The Lancet by two Italian researchers, the number of patients infected since February 21 in Italy is the \nfollow an \"exponential trend\". \"If this trend continues for another week, there will be 30,000 infected patients,\" advance. According to this investigation, which provides updated information on the Italian scenario, the average of the ages of people who died in the country was 81 years and more than two-thirds of these patients had diabetes, cardiovascular diseases or cancer. \"Although it is true that these patients had other health problems, it is also important to note that because of Sars-COV-2 needed respiratory support and would not have died otherwise\", the study advances. of the first 827 mortal victims, 14.1% were more than 90 years, 42.2% were between 80 and 89 years, 32.4% between 70 and 79 years, 8.4% between 60 and 69 years and only 2, 8% between 50 and 59 years. There are in Italy about 5200 beds in the intensive care units. Of these, the researchers are advancing, more than a thousand are already being occupied by citizens infected by SARS-COV-2. \"In the near future, this number will progressively increase to the point where thousands of beds will be occupied by patients with Covid-19. Given that the mortality of serious patients is high, the number of people infected in Italy will probably put great pressure on the intensive care of hospitals, some of which do not have adequate resources or teams to deal with this emergency, \"they believe Researchers. This factor can rise to mortality. The two experts believe that restriction measures have to continue to be imposed so that what happened in China does not happen in Italy. \"If the Italian outbreak follows China's similar trend, we can expect the number of newly infected patients to start decreasing. Likewise, we can predict that the cumulative curve of infected patients will reach their peak 30 days later, \"the authors suggest. While other countries deal every day with new cases of SARS-COV-2, China registered this \nFriday only eight new cases of infection, the lowest number since it started the daily count in January. By midnight on Thursday (16h00 hours on Wednesday, in Lisbon), mainland China recorded 3169 deaths and a total of 80,793 infected. But 62,793 people received discharge after having overcome the disease, to date, remaining 14,831 under treatment. The roles seem to have been inverted: in the face of imported cases, one of the priorities of the Chinese authorities is now \"protecting itself against importing\" infections from other countries. The numbers have fallen sharply from last month, when the number of new cases amounted to more than a thousand per day. The spokesman for the National Health Commission, Mi Feng, said Thursday that the peak of the epidemic has passed in China, but that \"the rapid development of the outside epidemic has brought new uncertainties.\" Subscribe newsletters for free and receive the best of the publicity and the deepest jobs of the public.

eventually be traced back to bats.   dr peter daszak, president of ecohealth alliance, who has been working in china for 15 years, studying diseases that jump from animals to people, said: \"we don't know the source yet, but there's pretty strong evidence that this is a bat-origin coronavirus.\"   \"it's probably going to be the chinese horseshoe bat,\" he added, referring to a common species that weighs up to 28g.   if he is right, this strain will join many other viruses that bats carry. the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and middle east respiratory syndrome epidemics were caused by bat coronaviruses, as was a highly destructive viral epidemic in pigs. one bat can host many different viruses without getting sick.   they are the natural reservoir for the marburg virus, and nipah and hendra viruses, which have caused human disease and outbreaks in africa, malaysia, bangladesh and australia.   they are thought to be the natural reservoir for the ebola virus. they also carry the rabies virus, but in that case the bats are affected by the disease. their tolerance of viruses, which surpasses that of other mammals, is one of their many distinctive qualities.   they are the only flying mammals, they devour disease-carrying insects by the ton, and they are essential in the pollination of many fruits, like bananas, avocados and mangoes. they are also an incredibly diverse group, making up about a quarter of all mammalian species.   but their ability to coexist with viruses that can spill over to other animals, in particular humans, can have devastating consequences when we eat them, trade them in livestock markets and invade their territory.   learning how they carry and survive so many viruses has been a deep question for science, and new research suggests that the answer may be how the bats' evolutionary adaptations to flight \nchanged their immune systems.   in a 2018 paper in cell host and microbe, scientists in china and singapore reported their investigation of how bats handle something called dna sensing.   the energy demands of flight are so great that cells in the body break down and release bits of dna that are then floating around where they should not be. mammals, including bats, have ways to identify and respond to such bits of dna, which might indicate an invasion of a disease-causing organism.   but in bats, the scientists found, evolution has weakened that system, which would normally cause inflammation as it fought the viruses.   bats have lost some genes involved in that response, which makes sense because the inflammation itself can be very damaging to the body. they have a weakened response, but it is still there.   thus, the researchers write, this weakened response may allow them to maintain a \"balanced state of 'effective response' but not 'over response' against viruses\".   how to manage and contain the current outbreak of the virus officially known as ncov-2019 is, of course, of paramount importance now. but tracing its origin and taking action to combat further outbreaks may depend partly on knowledge and monitoring of bats.   \"the outbreak can be contained and controlled,\" dr daszak said. \"but if we don't know the origin in the long term, then this virus can continue to spill over.\"   scientists in china were already studying the bats carefully, well aware that an outbreak like the current one would most likely happen.   in the spring, in an article on bat coronaviruses, or covs, a group of chinese researchers wrote that \"it is generally believed that bat-borne covs will re-emerge to cause the next disease outbreak.\"   they added: \"in this regard, china is a likely hot spot.\"   this was not clairvoyance, but conventional wisdom.   certainly rodents, primates and birds also carry diseases that can and have jumped to people; bats are far from alone in that regard. \nbut there are reasons they have been implicated in several disease outbreaks and are likely to be implicated in more. they are numerous and widespread. while bats account for a quarter of mammalian species, rodents are 50 per cent, and then there is the rest of us.   bats live on every continent except antarctica, in proximity to humans and farms. the ability to fly makes them wide-ranging, which helps in spreading viruses, and their faeces can spread disease.   people in many parts of the world eat bats and sell them in live animal markets, which was the source of sars and possibly the latest coronavirus outbreak that began in wuhan.   bats also often live in huge colonies in caves, where crowded conditions are ideal for passing viruses to one another.   in a 2017 report in nature, dr daszak, dr kevin j. olival and other colleagues from ecohealth alliance reported that they had created a database of 754 mammal species and 586 viral species, and analysed which viruses were harboured by which mammals and how they affected their hosts.   they confirmed what scientists had thought: \"bats are host to a significantly higher proportion of zoonoses than all other mammalian orders.\" zoonoses are diseases that spill over from animals to humans.   and they do not just survive the viruses they harbour. bats are remarkably long-lived for small mammals. the big brown bat, a common species in the united states, can live nearly 20 years in the wild.   others live closer to 40. one tiny bat in siberia lived at least 41 years. animals like house mice live about two years on average.   while the bats must be studied, their physiology understood, and the viruses they harbour monitored for the sake of public health, that does not mean that the bats are to blame for the outbreak.   as others have pointed out, humans have encroached on the lives of bats, not vice versa.   dr daszak stressed that stopping the sale of wildlife in markets is essential to curtail future outbreaks. but since \nsuch outbreaks are inevitable, he says, monitoring and studying wildlife, like bats, is equally important.   he compared the situation to terrorism. both terrorist attacks and disease outbreaks seem inevitable. to get a jump on them, he said, intelligence is vital.   nytimes "}, {"content": "south korean pm says \u2018turning point\u2019 near in coronavirus fight. seoul (reuters, afp) -\u00a0south korean officials warned against prematurely calling the

The numbers should not stop here and can even be aggravated at the end of the prolonged holiday of the Chinese Lunar New Year. To know that countries the virus can be imported more easily, Germany scientists used a computational model. In the case of Portugal, the risk of importing coronavirus is \"very low\", with the country in the 61th position of the relative risk list of importation of the virus. The Directorate-General for Health (DGS) also announced two more two cases suspected of infection by the new coronavirus - were six so far - and one of them has already negative, learned from the beginning of the night. The second case suspected, which had been sent to the University Center of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o, in Porto, also had a negative result, said DGS already tuesday, a few minutes after midnight. Cases of the new coronavirus have already been confirmed in more than 20 countries. Even though the vast majority of cases are restricted to China, the concern that may spread even more for the world. In order to assess the risk of importing cases to other countries, a team of the Humboldt University of Berlin and the Robert Koch Institute, both in Germany, used a computational model, where they considered the distribution of confirmed cases in China and the Air transport from 4000 airports and more than 50,000 air routes.

In addition to giving indications for each country, the model provides data for specific airports. Although I have already given so much to speak, we still do not know enough about the new coronavirus. Efforts have not missed and scientists from all over the world have been attentive to the virus. Among the latest news is the publication of the complete biomolecular virus code. Samples of the new coronavirus have been processed in laboratories from around the world and raw information on the genetic code has been sent to the repository of the United States National Health Institutes. From there, a team of the University of California in Santa Cruz (US) has collected information from 29,903 nucleotides - adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanine, basic chemical elements that constitute the DNA molecule, represented by letters A, T CEG - and made it available in the Public Database Genome Browser. \"By providing data on coronavirus in the Genome Browser of the University of California in Santa Cruz, this allows researchers to observe the structure \nOf the virus and, even more importantly, investigate how they can attack, \"says in a statement Hiram Clawson, investigator of that university. The way this coronavirus is transmitted has been another major issues. Coronavirus is transmitted by respiratory droplets, direct contact with infected and aerosol secretions in therapeutic procedures that produce them, refers to DGs. But how long does it persist on surfaces and how can it be inactivated? Two teachers from the Greifswald University Hospital, Germany, tried to answer these issues. To find answers, they analyzed studies on the CORONV\u00cdRUS SARS and MERS. It was verified that these viruses could persist on surfaces and remain infectious at room temperature, on average, between four and five days. \"Low temperatures and a high humidity in the air further increases your life time,\" says G\u00fcnter Kampf in a statement from her institution. Regarding the inactivation of the various coronaviruses, in tests with disinfectant solutions, it was found that agents with ethanol, the vulgar oxygenated water or sodium hypochlorite were effective against coronavirus. If these agents were applied at appropriate concentrations, they would reduce the pathogenic particles of a million to 100 in about one minute. For researchers, these results may be extrapolated to the new coronavirus. \"We analyzed different coronaviruses and the results were similar,\" says Eike Steinmann. This Tuesday and Wednesday, Scientists, Public Health Agency Professionals, Health Ministers and Research Financers will be reunited in Geneva (Switzerland) to define priorities in research and development of drugs, diagnoses and vaccines for coronavirus.
