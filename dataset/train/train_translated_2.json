  the health experts interviewed by today said that reinfection among discharged covid-19 patients is unlikely, although they said it is too early to determine the reasons why it happened.\u00a0\u00a0   taking reference from how the coronavirus that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) in 2002 and 2003 behaved, dr paul tambyah, president of the asia pacific society of clinical microbiology and infection, said: \u201cwe found high levels of immunity in recovered sars patients and this is likely to be the case with covid-19.\u201d   associate professor hsu li yang, who heads the infectious diseases programme at the national university of singapore\u2019s saw swee hock school of public health, agrees that patients infected with other coronaviruses do develop an immunity after an infection.\u00a0   \u201c(the immunity) lasts for at least a few years, although this immunity does not appear to be lifelong,\u201d he said.\u00a0   however, assoc prof hsu said that it is not yet known whether covid-19 would behave in the same manner because not enough time has lapsed for more research to be done on the virus yet.   offering his view on the matter is professor tikki elka pangestu, a visiting fellow at the lee kuan yew school of public policy and a former director of the world health \norganization\u2019s research policy and cooperation department in geneva.   he said that a discharged patient who tests positive again could be either a reactivation or reinfection.\u00a0   \u201cboth are possible and hard to differentiate. some viruses remain dormant but can reappear,\u201d prof pangestu said.\u00a0   emeritus professor duane gubler at the duke-national university of singapore medical school said that not enough is known about this virus to know what kind of immune response infected individuals develop.\u00a0   \u201cwe need serological tests to help determine what kind, how much and the duration of protective antibodies.\u201d   what could be causing the positive tests?   health experts told today that there could be several reasons why discharged patients get tested positive again. these include inaccurate tests being done or patients not being tested to confirm that they are free of the virus before being discharged.   emeritus prof gubler said that false positive results are not uncommon with the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test that is now being used for covid-19.\u00a0   a second set of primers \u2014 single strands of dna or rna, which stands for ribonucleic acid \u2014 that are based on a different part of the genome should be used for quality control, he added.   rna carries genetic information, enabling the tests to pinpoint organisms such as viruses.   the pcr test could also have detected viral rna that is not infectious but that can persist for various periods of time, emeritus prof gubler said.   \u201cit is possible for detectable rna to be present even though the patient has recovered clinically but is no longer infectious.\u201d   dr leong said one possibility is that wuhan hospitals discharge covid-19 patients who seem well but are not completely cleared of the virus.\u00a0   \u201cif you look at singapore\u2019s data on coronavirus, some people stay in hospital for 28 days not because they are sick for 28 days. they stay for 28 days but maybe sick for 10 to 14 days.   \u201cas for the rest of time, they are waiting for the test to turn out negative. singapore hospitals make sure it is negative twice before they are being discharged,\u201d dr leong explained.\u00a0   in china, a need for hospital beds, as well as a lack of pcr testing equipment could have pushed the authorities to adopt this procedure of discharging patients who have not been tested negative for the virus.

a player testing positive. a second person who spoke to ap on condition of anonymity said the league expects the shutdown to last a minimum of two weeks, but cautioned that timeframe is very fluid. \"it's a very serious time right now,\" miami heat coach erik spoelstra said. \"i think the league moved appropriately and prudently and we'll all just have to monitor the situation and see where it goes from here.\" the jazz released a statement saying a player - they did not identify gobert - tested negative earlier wednesday for flu, strep throat and an upper respiratory infection. that player's symptoms diminished as the day went along, but the decision was made to test for covid-19 anyway. that test came back with a preliminary positive result. \"the individual is currently in the care of health officials in oklahoma city,\" the jazz said, adding that updates would come as appropriate. for most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. the vast majority of people recover from the new virus. according to the world health organization, which declared a pandemic on wednesday, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. in mainland china, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have been diagnosed and more than 58,000 have so far recovered. it has been a worldwide issue for several weeks. and now, it has hit the nba. \"this is \ncrazy,\" cleveland forward tristan thompson said on twitter. charlotte hornets coach james borrego, speaking before his team's game at miami, said \"these are scary times.\" rapidly evolving times, as well. around 7 p.m., a person with knowledge of the situation told ap that owners - who met by teleconference wednesday - were largely in support of a plan to play games in empty arenas on a short-term basis. about an hour later, the thunder-jazz game was halted before tip-off. and about 90 minutes after that, the season was called off, effective when the last whistle was to blow wednesday night. that came even earlier than planned: the last game of the night's six-game slate, new orleans at sacramento, was called off as well because one of the referees assigned to work that pelicans-kings game, courtney kirkland, worked a utah game on monday. \"the game was canceled out of an abundance of caution,\" the nba said. there are 259 games, roughly 21% of the schedule, left to play this season -

The worst thing that can happen when an epidemic is in a position to spread on an international scale is that panic and each country attempts to apply prevention or containment measures without counting on others, because, in that case, the risk of situating In the worst possible scenario and give an excessive response that aggravates the consequences is very high. It is what could begin to occur with the Epidemic of Coronavirus 2019-NECOP arising in the city of Wuhan on December 31 as they were confirming new cases of contagion outside of China. That is why it is justified that WHO will decree the international emergency on Thursday, since that guarantees a coordinated strategy of the different countries affected under the authority of the United Nations Agency.\nIn the last week, the propagation of the virus all over China has accelerated, until reaching more than 9,500 affected and 213 deaths, 90% of them in the province of Hubei where the epidemic arose. Although the number of affected exceeds 8,096 that caused SARS in 2003, the acute respiratory syndrome caused by another coronavirus that caused more than 700 deaths, the mortality rate in this new epidemic is lower, around 3%. The most disturbing aspect of the new Coronavirus is that it can be spread in the incubation period - which can last 14 days, that is, before presenting symptoms, so it complicates the monitoring of possible contacts. But the measures adopted by the Chinese authorities seem, at the moment, effective ones to contain their expansion. Keep in mind that 15,250 suspected cases on a population of 1,300 million inhabitants have been reported.\nThe return to our country of 21 people who were in Wuhan should not cause a concern, since the necessary protection and quarantine measures have been taken to prevent the virus from spreading.\nThe Coronavirus are living organisms with special capacity for mutation and health authorities work in these cases on different possible scenarios. But at the moment, public health experts see as the most likely scenario that the epidemic is treated from now on. At the moment, the number of cases diagnosed outside of China are very few and are controlled, so, according to WHO, it is not necessary to apply restrictions on trade or travel, and even less the closure of borders.\nThe International Emergency Declaration should not be interpreted as a lack of confidence in Chinese capacity to control the epidemic, as WHO has emphasized. The virtue of this measure lies in that, once the presence of the virus was detected in at least 19 countries, it allows to coordinate the response at an international scale and act quickly if the virus extended to countries with a health system without reaction capacity.\nIn the same way that WHO has learned from previous episodes, also of this should be improved lessons. One of them is to evaluate the convenience of a gradual and flexible statement of the international emergency to avoid the insecurity that has caused the fact that the Emergency Committee was divided when deciding last week that this statement still It was not justified.\nYou can follow the country review on Facebook, Twitter or subscribe here to the Newsletter.

The coordinator of the Medical-Surgical Intensive Care Unit of the Hospital Pulido Valente, in Lisbon, stresses that although there is still much to know about this virus, this outbreak should be covered or alarmism or indifferently. But it has a certainty: the risk of this type of outbreaks will be permanent for mankind. This virus surprised the world. Is it, in fact, amazing? It is not surprising. In fact, this is a recurring phenomenon. Only in the last 20 years, the same has happened to the family of this virus twice: in 2002 with SARS-COV and in 2012 with MERS-COV. Cyclically, there are viruses that can cross the species barrier, that is, leave an animal species and can pass into the human species, causing diseases. Now we have the ability to detect more frequently and accompany globally. What is already known about this new coronavirus? Probably the main host will be the bat and there is an intermediate host that allowed the passage to the human being. We also know that it has a sequence of genes between 70% to 80% similar to SARS-COV. The incubation period can reach up to 14 days, but in most patients the appearance of the symptoms occurred between the seventh and the eighth day. Although, according to the data made available, it affects more adults and the male gender, there are data that proved has already caused disease in all age groups. So far, according to the information of the Chinese authorities, between 20% to 25% of the cases are associated with pneumonia and between 10% to 15% linked to the respiratory distress syndrome. What characterizes these clinical frames? According to data published in The Lancet magazine, a large majority have a high fever, followed by dry cough. Some of the patients evolve for lack of air and other respiratory difficulties. There is a small percentage of patients who may have diarrhea, but is lower than in other outbreaks such as Mers-COV. We still do not know much information nor if this applies to different populations from China. We have verified that there are only mortality and severe cases in China. To date, none of the cases in Europe, in the US and Canada is serious or no one passed away. SARS-COV had a 10% mortality rate, which is very significant. So far, the new coronavirus is 3 or 4%. Most coronavirus strains circulate between animals and does not infect humans. What has happened here? It happened what is normal in nature: there was a virus that managed to find a key to bind to a human receptor. If there are situations of close proximity to animals - probably of sick animals -, this will allow inhalation of a large viral load of the animal to the human and conditions are created for the virus \nMay Replicate. As it is a completely new virus for the human, it has the ability to trigger diseases. The virulence associated with diversity between animal species makes, at least at first, the virus is more difficult to transmit between humans. As it is adapted, it is transmitted more, but it loses some characteristics that differentiate it in relation to the virus that had [initially] infected humans. Generally, the process of adapting a virus that passes from the animal world to humans walks this way. But there is always unpredictability and its evolution can only be documented in the end. At this point, we are dealing with a situation of unpredictability of the evolution of the new coronavirus. What are the reasons for this outbreak emerged in China? China has an immense dimension and represents a huge population slice with different population groups. Food habits include intake of many different animals and markets where it is possible to sell and purchase live animals. All this provides situations of greater proximity and exposure risk that are not verified in other countries. How is the transmission between humans? For now, it is confirmed that there is effective transmission between humans and that, in some cases, this happened before people have symptoms. What cells affects? The cells of the respiratory apparatus. The main connection element to enter the cells is probably a receiver called ACE2, which is a more predominant receptor in the lower respiratory apparatus. This may explain the largest number of cases of pneumonia and severe forms that may occur [however, with lower ease of transmission]. But we do not know if there will be another receiver. In order to exist greater ease of transmission, more complaints in the upper airways and cases of lesser gravity, there must be another type of receptors or else all this happens in people with higher ACE2 proportions in the upper airways. Is this virus even more infectious than SARS-COV? At this moment, I do not know if we have knowledge that allow us to say that. We do not even know the real number of infected people not all the size of the problem in China. Regarding the number of cases of China, there are a little significant number of cases in Europe, US or Canada. If it were very infectious, it was predictable to happen in these countries what happened to SARS-COV, in which there was a huge outbreak in Canada. In what phase can it be more contagious? Probably must be between the 10th and 12th day. More or less, this will happen two to four days after the beginning of the complaints. Are there people who can have greater contagion capacity? In Sars-COV, there were people who had the particularity of being able to convey the virus with greater viral quantity: they were the superdisseminators. This is not yet documented in the new coronavirus, but may explain that some people may have had more capacity to \ninfecting others and in pre-symptomatic periods. It may have been what happened in Germany: a superdisseminiform [Chinese nationality] had a meeting on the 21st [with the person who infected] and began to have symptoms on the 23rd. People infected in Germany began to complain to Day 27 and 28. In principle, it would be asymptomatic or, maybe, had a very slight form of symptoms that did not value. All this needs to be analyzed. I find it important to be looking at what is happening in China, but the situation in Germany will be important in terms of knowledge. European cases will be fundamental to complement available information and that comes from China. China has been praised for the speed of genome sequencing and data transparency. Did you learn from SARS-COV? Often, compliments relate to what happened precisely in the past with SARS, in which there was censorship and blocking of information. China has even learned a simple thing: no isolated country has the ability to handle an outbreak to this scale. We have much more ability to respond, analyze and understand when we work in a network and transparently. The World Health Organization (WHO) has shown it reluctant to declare a global public health emergency. why? WHO is assessing very well what is happening to take the most appropriate decision in terms of benefit to control of the outbreak and minimization of losses that these measures may have. Declaring Global Emergency has very large implications in terms of travel or trade constraints. WHO must ponder according to the knowledge and severity of the situation. And it has acted well: these decisions have to be taken in the most weighted and rational way possible without alarmism or indifference. But will it be inevitable? What will happen is unpredictable due to the evolution of the virus and the behavior of people. There are different levels of risk. The risk of a country with direct and closest flights from China is different from that of a country that does not have them. What is the risk in Portugal? It's not null. We live in a global world and there may be some case. We must be prepared to detect it early and minimize the risk of transmission in the community. we are ready? At this stage, we are. In theory, we are always prepared. In practice, we will only know when we have a case. What is finding from Measures of China, such as quarantines? You have more information. China is showing a great intention in trying to control the outbreak. At this time, what was done by the Chinese authorities has been effective in the lower transmission of cases out of China. What about the repatriation of Portuguese in Wuhan and non-compulsive insulation? When the Portuguese arrive and according to the knowledge that is at the time, the necessary measures will be adapted. What now may seem insufficient to be adequate or inadequate with what is known at the time. I assume that many \nThese patients will want to be in isolation until they do not infect the closest. In Portugal, it is the Directorate-General for Health that coordinates this process and has so far coordinated well. He had also given evidence of this in the flu pandemic A and the surge of Legionella. If doubts there was about the importance of a National Health Service, these outbreaks dissipate it at all. What measures should still be applied? The most important measures will be the development of specific drugs and a vaccine. In specific drugs, some with experience in patients with HIV infection, which is Lopinavir and ritonavir, as well as the Remdesivir [developed for the treatment of ebola virus]. Probably, until others will have to be tried. There are doubts about the importance and interest of certain types of medicines, namely corticosteroids, because they have an exaggerated response from the immune system and even known that in the flu can be harmful. To treat these patients, we need quickly. Some vaccine investigation lines also resumed the work done for SARS-COV. But a vaccine has to be tested yet in terms of efficacy and safety. The most useful would be a vaccine for a common part of these viruses in order to avoid these outbreaks in the future. How are patients being treated? With organ support therapy, we use in many other diseases. What we do is to keep the patient's homeostasis, often through drugs or devices that ensure the function of the organ in order to give time to the organism to recover. For example, when the lung ceases to have capacity for gaseous exchanges, we ensure these exchanges through the fan. When we do this, let's give time for the lung to be repaired in order to take progressively your physiology. If there is a specific drug, we will have the most easier life. Is this how they will be treated possible patients in Portugal? At this time, what is available in Portugal are intensive care units with organ support and insulation therapy, to avoid the risk of transmission and for visits and family members. How can science prepare us for these outbreaks? It is thought that between two to three microorganisms per year emerge or reissue with capacity to cause human diseases. Now we have means of diagnosis, monitoring and surveillance that allow us to more frequently detect these episodes and accompany them on a global scale. In the case of Legionella, in which the first cases emerged in 1975, the bacteria was only identified almost a year later. Now we had the ability to detect the virus and sequencing it in weeks. All that is done in terms of improving diagnostic, monitoring and acting methods will allow us to detect more of these situations. How can this virus come from? The risk of infections by ancient microorganisms \nemerging or reemergent is perpetual. This will be a permanent risk to mankind. Now we have a greater capacity to characterize [viruses]. From time to time, microorganisms have the ability to cause diseases by novelty, emergency or reprehensible mechanism. We must get used to and realize that this can happen, without alarmism or indifference, but with acting and knowledge. Can we reach a pandemic?

to case 83, a 54-year-old singaporean man, and both did not travel to china recently. husband and wife are linked to the life church and missions singapore cluster. \n through the use of a new testing method, which\u00a0is able to detect past infections in someone who has recovered from it, the singaporean couple\u00a0were identified on tuesday as the missing link between the life church and

method,\u00a0results came back positive for covid-19 on feb 22 afternoon. \n before she was warded, she had mostly stayed home on rivervale drive in sengkang. \n links between previous cases \n further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases, moh said. this was made possible with the assistance of the singapore police force. \n six of the locally transmitted confirmed cases (cases 31, 33, 38, 83, 90 and 91), as well as cases 8 and 9, are linked to the life church and missions singapore (146b paya lebar road). \n

confirmed cases (cases 30, 36 and 39) are linked to the private business meeting held at the grand hyatt singapore from jan 20 to 22. \n five of the confirmed cases (cases 42, 47, 52, 56 and 69) are linked to the seletar aerospace heights construction site. \n update on confirmed cases \n moh said that of the 33 confirmed cases who are still in hospital, most are stable or improving. \n seven are in critical condition under intensive care. \n contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing and as of tuesday noon, there have been 2,846 close contacts who have been quarantined. \n of these,

cause illness in animals or humans. in humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars). the most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease covid-19. covid-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. this new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in wuhan, china, in december 2019. the most common symptoms of covid-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. these symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. some people become infected but don\u2019t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. around 1 out of every 6 people who gets covid-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. people with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention. people can catch covid-19 from others who have the virus. the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid-19 coughs or exhales. these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air. see previous answer on \"how does covid-19 spread?\" the main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. the risk of catching covid-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. however, many people with covid-19 experience only mild symptoms. this is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. it is therefore possible to catch covid-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill. who is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of covid-19 and will continue to share updated findings. the risk of catching covid-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. while initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a main feature of the outbreak. who is assessing ongoing research on the ways covid-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating. while some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of covid-19, there is no \nevidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. who does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for covid-19. however, there are several ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional medicines. who will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings are available. only wear a mask if you are ill with covid-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have covid-19. disposable face mask can only be used once. if you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. there is a world-wide shortage of masks, so who urges people to use masks wisely. while there has been one instance of a dog being infected in hong kong, to date, there is no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can transmit covid-19. covid-19 is mainly spread through droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. to protect yourself, clean your hands frequently and thoroughly. who continues to monitor the latest research on this and other covid-19 topics and will update as new findings are available. yes. the likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes covid-19 from a package that has been moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature is also low. it is not certain how long the virus that causes covid-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the covid-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. this may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment). if you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose. while we are still learning about how covid-2019 affects people, older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others.

Facebook users have been sharing publications that ensure that 5G networks, not Coronavirus, are sick to people.\nThe publications include a list of other affirmations that deny the reality of the virus and mention several conspiracy arguments about the virus.\nThe coronavirus outbreak began in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The centers for the control and prevention of diseases say on their website that the virus is linked to a \"seafood and livestock market\" where humans could have contracted an animal virus. The virus then spread person to person.

The propagation of the coronavirus is given person to person. (here)\nMobile phones use radio waves. They send and receive radio frequency electromagnetic fields (CEM RF). The 5G uses a \"bundle shaping technology\", which allows the radiofrequency electromagnetic fields to go directly where it is needed (here).\nThe International Commission on protection against non-ionizing radiation (ICNIRP) published in 2020 standards to limit exposure to electromagnetic fields, after seven years of research. They include information about 5G networks.\nThe Commission says that the main effect that the radio frequency electromagnetic fields have in the human body is a higher temperature of the exposed fabric. The body can handle small increases in body temperature, as during exercise, but exposure to radiofrequency and the higher temperature can be dangerous on a certain threshold (here).\nAccording to the ICNIRP, \"another general characteristic of the CEM RF is that the greater the frequency, the lower the penetration depth of the EMFS in the body. Since 5G technologies can use higher frequencies of CEM (> 24 GHz) in addition to The ones currently used (<4 GHz), the power of these higher frequencies will be absorbed mainly at a more superficial level than that of previous telecommunications technologies (...) therefore, exposure to 5g will not cause any harm as long as It adhere to the rules of ICNIRP (2020) \"(here).\nEric van Rongen, president of ICNIRP, said in a video that there is no evidence that electromagnetic fields cause effects on health such as cancer, electrohypensability, infertility or something else. The only two effects recognized in health are nervous stimulation over 10 MHz and heat from 100 kHz (here).\nThe World Health Organization said that no research has associated exposure to wireless technology with negative health effects (here). WHO affirms on its website that will continue to review research in this area and performing \"health risk assessments\" of all radiofrequency ranges that will be available in 2022.\nMarvin c.

What it does seem clear at the moment is that the disease is less serious than two other ailments of the family: SARS and MERS. The international alert would mean the implementation of preventive measures around the world, and in the past it has been declared five times: before the H1N1 (2009) flu outbreak, those of Ebola in West Africa (2014) and in the Republic Democratic of the Congo (2019), Polio in 2014 and that of Zika virus in 2016. The WHO meeting has occurred after a press conference of the State Council of China, which announced the hypothesis that the 2019 virus- ncov has mutated, which would complicate their \ntreatment. \"The number of cases identified is increasing because we have a greater understanding of the disease, better methods of diagnosis and more mobilized resources,\" said Li Bin, vice president of the National Health Commission. The growing number of positives could also be attributed to an exercise of transparency by local and regional administrations following the instructions of the Chinese Communist Party, which has threatened to punish those makeup reality. \"Everyone who does not say the truth will be nailed to the pillar of shame for all eternity,\" Chan An Jian proclaimed Monday, official profile of the Central Commission of Political and Legal Affairs, Supervisor Arm of the Party on Legal Party .

Li Bin also recognized that the proximity of the Chinese New Year - which will take place next Saturday - supposes a high-risk factor for the expansion of the outbreak. During the holiday week that follows the festival, it is customary to visit relatives or travel abroad, resulting in more than 3,000 million displacements, the world's greatest human migration. For this reason, the representative has communicated the taking of \"high efficiency measures to ensure the development of a spring festival [as is known to the harmonious and stable celebration\". Both Chinese authorities and WHO experts are on the ground in Wuhan. The investigation has as a priority to identify the sources of the virus, as there could be more focalities in addition to Huanan's fish and seafood market, the original. In this area, where \"it was marketed with live animals illegally\" and in quarantine for weeks, it has been where the pathogen would have come in contact with human beings for the first time, as indicated at the Gao Fu press conference, director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The second objective goes by knowing more about the transmission pathways of the disease, linked to the respiratory tract and causes symptoms similar to those of ordinary pneumonia. \"We are still gathering information about the virus, the more we know more effective we will be in our action,\" the researcher said, adding that \"the existence of superpropagers [highly contagious infected] is not proven\".

In the United States there are three airports that have established specific controls in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. North Korea, directly closed its borders to foreign tourists. The measures come before a drip of cases outside of China: Thailand, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and the United States have confirmed infections on their borders of people who had been in the epicenter city of the outbreak. Andres Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, the president of Mexico, has confirmed this Wednesday that they are studying a patient in the state of Tamaulipas, northwest of Mexico. \"It's under observation\".

american consumers and be a goodwill gesture to china and other trading partners suffering from the economic effects of covid-19,\" the post and courier of charleston, south carolina, wrote in an

301 tariffs and retaliatory tariffs can be suspended or removed to spur economic growth and job creation.\"    derek scissors, a china policy expert at the american enterprise institute who has advised the administration in the past, said mnuchin still favors broader tariff relief as a way to boost economic growth.    \"the wall street representatives in and out of the administration constantly push for tariff cuts, from the time the deal was struck through last week,\" scissors said. \"the risk of a trade deficit jump later in the year, as the china tries to export its way to a v-shaped recovery, has blocked them.\"    white house trade adviser peter navarro, the administration's loudest anti-china voice, denied that tariffs might be lifted.    \"there are no discussions within the white house about that. that is simply a fake news gambit by the usual wall street suspects who never met an american job they didn\u2019t want to offshore for the sake of a buck,\" he said.    even economists who support lifting tariffs say it may not be effective as a short-term stimulus.    \"permanently lifting the tariffs on china is a good idea,\" said heritage foundation

reported in over a dozen countries across the world, from australia to the us, to germany and sri lanka. in china, as of january 28, there have been 106 confirmed deaths. the virus, according to chinese scientists, likely originates from bats with over a decade's worth of research showing that coronaviruses in bats can cause human pandemics with unusual alacrity. this novel (as in new) coronavirus, some scientists argue, might be even more dangerous to humans than others such as sars, the viral respiratory disease that caused hundreds of deaths around the world in eight or so months

under observation had respiratory problems and had contracted coughs, colds and fevers. other patients in hospitals from jaipur to kerala have also been kept under observation. a single case in neighbouring nepal was reported on january 24. government authorities say they are being vigilant, running thousands of checks on travellers from the many countries in which people have been affected by coronaviruses, but some experts have called into question the preparedness of the country's medical system to deal with any extensive outbreak. many have been critical of the chinese government's response, which has veered from lackadaisical in december, when it claimed the coronavirus was not being spread through people to people contact, to panicked now as it has effectively put tens of millions of people in quarantine. a few hundred indians, mostly medical students, are currently in wuhan. according to a tweet by ministry of external affairs spokesperson raveesh kumar, a plan is being put together to evacuate indian nationals, though a waiting air india passenger jet had, at the time of writing, yet to be dispatched. other countries, including japan and the us, have also made plans to evacuate their nationals. any 'rescue' plan, though, needs to be sanctioned by chinese authorities, since wuhan has been sealed off from the rest of the country. on january 27, a man died in beijing, the first fatality in the chinese capital. in response to the coronavirus, many countries have recommended that their nationals not travel to china. the health ministry has recommended that non-essential travel to china be postponed and that indians in china should \"follow simple public health measures\", including frequent hand-washing and covering their mouths when coughing. despite fears expressed about indian preparedness, the \nauthorities in various states insist they are taking necessary precautions. union health minister harsh vardhan pointed out that despite scares and some hundreds of patients being tested and observed, there had still not been any report of a verified case of the coronavirus in india. this may be premature, given the rate at which countries around the world are reporting incidences. nonetheless, the death toll has, so far, been confined to china, with the fatality rate remaining steady at less than three per cent. the centre has also set up a 24-hour helpline, and has been thermal screening passengers at select airports. but the government admits it is also reliant on people -- particularly those who have travelled to china -- monitoring symptoms that are quite broad and can easily be mistaken for a regular cold, cough or respiratory illness, not uncommon in india, particularly in the pollution-ridden cities of the north. the advice given by authorities such as the national disaster management authority has been broad and bland, encouraging good personal hygiene and attention to diet, exercise and sleep patterns. such advice is evidence that the authorities do not yet fully understand the novel coronavirus. work on a vaccine has begun, with the hope that experience gained in dealing with sars will hasten the process. even in a best-case scenario, though, any putative vaccine would take months to develop. as of now, the world health organization has stopped short of describing the coronavirus as an international public health emergency, though it acknowledged that its previous assessment of the risk posed internationally was understated. google trends have shown that while international interest in the coronavirus has led to much internet browsing, people in australia, canada, india and the us, in particular, have been confusing or associating the virus with corona beer, with searches for 'coronavirus beer', 'corona virus beer', and 'virus corona beer' spiking spectacularly over the past couple of weeks. perhaps, a weak smile is still the only appropriate response to worldwide apprehension. alarmingly, a new global health security index, released in october 2019, suggested that \"not a single country in the world is fully prepared to handle an epidemic or pandemic\". india scored above the global average, although not as highly as developed economies, and still its score was only 46.5 out of a possible 100. we are, the chinese experience has shown, uniquely vulnerable to the coronavirus, with

The trend in the cases reported in Wuhan \"widely supports\" mathematical models that the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine is using to predict the transmission dynamics of the epidemic, according to scientists of this institution, cited by the Bloomberg financial information agency. \"Assuming that current trends are maintained, we are designing a peak between mid and end of February\" in Wuhan, told the Agency the associate professor of epidemiology of infectious diseases Adam Kucharski. Kucharski, who analyzes the spread of infectious diseases like Ebola, explained that \"there is a lot of uncertainty, hence it is being cautious in choosing a single value for the peak, but it is possible, based on current data, that we see a peak of prevalence above 5% \". Wuhan, the Chinese city where the 2019-NCov emerged at the end of last year, quarantined since January 23, restricting the movement of 11 million people.

Mapping the outbreak of the new coronavirus worldwide, Kucharski and colleagues from the British institution based their models in a set of hypotheses about the 2019-NCOV. These include a 5.2-day incubation period, delay at the beginning of the symptoms for confirming 6.1-day infection and the risk of infection between the 10 million people who were identified as the most vulnerable in Wuhan. Based on these data, a prevalence of 5% amounts to about 500 thousand infections in total. This is often more than the 14,982 cases that the provincial health authorities had reported in Wuhan until 8pm on Saturday night in China. \"The next two weeks are really critical to understand what is happening,\" said, in turn, Benjamin Cowling, Head of Epidemiology and Bioestatistics at the University of Hong Kong, in an interview in Melbourne on Thursday. They will also be critical, warned, to know \"if the virus is spreading to other locations or if we have avoided what could be a global pandemic because of the control measures adopted and implemented so far.\" The number of deaths resulting from the pneumonia outbreak caused by the new coronavirus (2019-NCOV) amounts to 910, according to the latest Sunday balance sheets, of which 908 occurred in mainland China, where the number of infected exceeds 39 thousand.

Should the Corona epidemic last longer and also affect other world regions more strongly, however, serious impacts, among other things, would become more likely. \"The situation in Italy therefore ensures me.\" The German economy warned of the consequences of the coronavirus crisis in Italy. \"The rapid spread of the virus, especially in the north, meets Italy's Economic Center and currently ensures additional uncertainty of the German export economy,\" said Volker Treier, Foreign Enchief Chief of the German Industrial and Commerce Chamber (DIHK).

At a time when the hypothesis increases that the new Coronavirus called Covid-19 is the result of a US Biological War, a group of Iranian doctors, through a letter addressed to regional presidents, have asked for total destruction Of American biological laboratories throughout the region. As it is public knowledge, the rapid propagation of the new Coronavirus (COVID-19) has severely affected almost all the countries of the world. We, a group of Iranian doctors, experts in infectious diseases, pneumology, asthma and allergy, are witnessing how many of our compatriots are contracted the fearsome virus, and we are doing, day and night, everything that is within our reach to Save the sick, as all doctors are doing in other countries. But numerous evidence and news have been published both in recognized scientific articles in the world, as in the media, citing genetic and biology experts, as well as on Wikileaks documents, which strengthen the hypothesis of the genetic manipulation of Covid-19 In biological laboratories and American biological attack through this virus. China's Ministry of Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Monday in its most serious position, that there is evidence to believe that the new Coronavirus (Covid-19) was produced and propagated by US scientists in 2015. United States put China in the process To collect information about the new Coronavirus, and Chinese scientists found an article published in 2015 by the Journal Nature Medicine which indicates that US scientists could identify a new type of coronavirus that has a direct impact on humans. ladies and gentlemen; Given the controversy raised on the role of the United States in the production of the new Coronavirus, it is essential to take into account the Black Washington History in the use of biological weapons, to reach a correct and comprehensive decision in this situation and for the purpose To preserve human lives and prevent people from the future do not blame us or from us because of the possible silence and ignorance at this great crime in the history of humanity. The history of the United States in the application of biological attacks dates into a research project and the development of biological weapons, directed by a civil organization (the war reserve service) in 1942 under the Order of Franklin d. Roosevelt, the then president of the US, in the Frederick Field (Maryland). This war strategy has been placed on the Agenda (North American) against countries that put at risk the interests of this country. The United States has made several attacks in different parts of the world, producing biological weapons such as Bacillus bacteria \nAnthracis, cause of the carbunco; The Bacteria Francisella tularensis, cause of tularemia or the fever of rabbits; Brucella, the bacteria causing malt fever; The Bacteria of Coxiella Burnetii, the cause of Q fever; The Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus; botulinum toxin, the cause of botulism and enterotoxin B staphylococcal; as well as the Ebola virus. In these cases, the chemical attack against Hiroshima and Nagasaki is also added. The unfortunate thing is that this country has endangered the lives of its own citizens to prove their biological weapons. Only as an example in 2008, the US government office He confirmed that dozens of civilian missiles could have been exposed to biological agents, because of several experiments, among them, those of the so-called \"project 112\" that had been carried out in 1962. The army of this country denied any pollution of people , however, the tests made envelopes these people showed that several of them suffered infectious diseases for years. The centers for the control and prevention of diseases from the USA. (CDC, for its acronym in English) has categorized the microbial agents used in biological weapons in three groups of A, B and C, based on the scope of their risk; and has put viruses such as H1N1 influenza, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which causes a serious respiratory infection, in category c. This category includes emerging and highly pathogenic microorganisms that, given their easy availability and reproduction and spread, may change according to biotechnologies, such as mortal organisms, be used in biological weapons. One of the reasons why COVID-19 can be considered as a production of biological laboratories is its strange similarity to SARS disease. SARS is a serious respiratory disease, originated in China, which infected more than 8,000 people and killed another 774 around the world in 2002. SARS is among diseases that was demonstrated that was caused by genetic manipulation. This disease is a serious respiratory syndrome that begins with high fever, chill, headache, fatigue and myalgia. Later, the patient suffers dry cough that can be aggravated to cause respiratory problems and lack of oxygen in the blood. In the laboratory, chest x-ray shows pneumonia and blood test shows the reduction of white platelets and blood cells. Our observations in hospitals show that the Coronavirus, in the most common way, causes the cold, although in some cases it causes the serious respiratory syndrome, that is SARS.

earlier this week been declared a pandemic by the world health organization.\u00a0   and dinner with the elderly folks was out of the question till the situation improves, the general practitioner (gp) replied to her daughter.\u00a0   the 51-year-old, who works at healthmark medical clinic in punggol, would rather be safe than sorry. since the clinic is a public health preparedness clinic (phpc), a network of clinics providing subsidised treatment and medication during public health outbreaks, she could never be certain if the next patient she sees is a covid-19 carrier, and her worst fear is that she may end up transmitting the virus to her parents who are in their 80s.\u00a0   that is why she has restricted her family\u2019s visits to her parents\u2019 house to less than 30 minutes each time. even then, they would not have dinner together, unlike before.\u00a0   dr leong choon kit, 53, who runs mission medical clinic in serangoon, is keeping a distance of at least one metre from his loved ones, including his wife and teenage daughter.   that means sleeping on a foldable mattress at night, while his wife takes the spot on the bed. and there are no hugs and kisses too, he added.   sacrifices such as these have become part and parcel of life for those working on the frontline in the fight against the highly contagious covid-19 virus in singapore, which has seen a total of 200 confirmed cases as of friday (march 13).   for more than a month now, frontline healthcare workers have been grappling with lost time with family members and disruptions to their personal routines and plans.\u00a0   many have to endure working long hours under a plasticky nursing gown, goggles that could fog up, an n95 mask so snugly-fitted that it could cause a headache over prolonged use, a shower cap and gloves.\u00a0   they also have to deal with the mental strain of having to keep up with constantly changing standard operating protocols and definitions of suspect cases as the covid-19 situation rapidly evolves.    ms ong zh hua, an assistant nurse clinician at tan tock seng hospital who works in both the screening centre and emergency department, writes her

come with it, deputy prime minister heng swee keat announced in parliament on feb 28 that public officers directly battling the disease will get a special bonus of up to one month, while a one-off covid-19 grant will be given to 900 phpcs, including more than 600 gp clinics, which had been activated to deal with the public health crisis.\u00a0   as singaporeans adjust to living with covid-19, today spoke to some 20 frontline workers to get a glimpse of how their lives had been upended by the pandemic.\u00a0   mitigating risk in the family   in the initial days of the outbreak, when alarming numbers of reported deaths from china dominated the news daily and struck fear in the hearts of many, dr leong could sense from chat groups that many of his peers in the gp community were \u201cvery stressed out\u201d.\u00a0   one sunday in early february, dr leong, who doubles up as a leader of a primary care network under the ministry of health (moh), got a call from a fellow gp.\u00a0   the caller asked dr leong to look after his young children should he die from the virus, and to explain to them how he died when they are older.   \u201cit is still early! why are we talking about dying?\u201d dr leong remembered saying in reply.   dr philip koh, 54, a gp with a healthway medical branch in tampines, said a young doctor had also shared with him that for the first time, he had told his father \u201ci love you\u201d, just in case he dies from covid-19.   while such anxiety has since subsided as more scientific information of the virus emerges, some gps today, especially those with young kids and elderly parents, still remain adamant about not taking chances in risking the lives of their loved ones.   among them is dr lee, a gp who goes beyond the moh requirements to wear the full ppe for every single patient he sees.\u00a0   inevitably, his outfit had attracted the attention of some of his patients, said the doctor who declined to give his full name.\u00a0   but the 35-year-old, who practises in an aljunied clinic and works part-time as a locum, would explain to them that it is his way of protecting his two-year-old daughter who is also

the full ppe is all the more necessary for him, as he had observed a trend of patients making false declarations that they had no respiratory symptoms at the front counter of the clinic, only to \u201cambush\u201d him by coming clean to him about their runny nose, sore throat or cough in the consultation room.   typically, a clinic following phpc guidelines would have triage staff segregating patients who better fit covid-19 suspect case definition from other patients to minimise any cross-transmission. the process also ensures that the gp could be forewarned to don the ppe before seeing higher-risk patients.\u00a0   dr lee got so irritated with such irresponsible behaviour that he decided to take a tally during a shift on march 5, and found that five out of the 20 patients he saw within a two-hour period were not upfront about their medical condition.\u00a0   \u201cit beats me why they don\u2019t declare\u2026 they lie even when the triage staff warned them twice about the consequences of what might happen to them if they don\u2019t declare,\u201d said dr lee.   \u201ci put my life on the line to help, so i am asking the public to be more socially responsible.\u201d

\u201cuseful for the patients\u201d, since moh had advised that a patient should be reviewed by the same gp if they continued to develop symptoms after consulting one.   the 47-year-old gp who sees an average of 50 to 60 patients daily \u2014 about half of them coming in with fever, flu or cough \u2014 said he will wait for the number of covid-19 cases here to dwindle before considering taking leave.   asked when that might be, he said: \u201cit is very hard to predict. we can\u2019t say the next month, may, or june.\u201d\u00a0   regardless, he is ready to put in the hours for as long as the outbreak drags on.   in his second televised address to the nation on the covid-19 situation on march 12, prime minister lee hsien loong said the outbreak \u201cwill continue for some time \u2014

cavan road in lavender.   it happened to be his very first shift at ncid and an unexpected crowd of 300 worried individuals flocked to the screening centre to get checked for covid-19, after moh said it would be getting in touch with people who had recent close contact with individuals with travel history to mainland china.   dr ng was the only senior doctor rostered with five junior doctors then.\u00a0   \u201cthat was a very, very bad shift, but we survived because people came from all over to help,\u201d said the 33-year-old. \nbefore he knew it, manpower was diverted from the team manning the emergency department. two consultants, two registrars and a few more doctors arrived to help at short notice.   and not once did he sense anyone having the attitude of \u201cit is not my

Thus, new preparations against cardiac and renal insufficiency are in the broad development stage, which he trusts great market potential, said Pharma boss Stefan Oelrich.\nEven the last weakening business with over-the-counter drugs recovered in 2019 thanks to cost reductions. On the other hand, the business developed around seed and plant protection products. Thus, the agricultural division was significantly increased thanks to the Monsanto acquisition, which was sealed over the course of 2018.\nHowever, for a better comparability of developments in 2018 and 2019, the Group also indicates how the agricultural segment would have developed when Monsanto would be included all year 2018.

(DPA) ", "label": 1}, {"content": "the world stands still. Only Sweden not. Since 2018 Christian Steiner is head of the ARD studio in Stockholm. His report area extends from Greenland to Estonia, from the North Cape to Lithuania. Anyone who goes through Stockholm these days notes that it has become a bit quieter in the Swedish capital. The big cinemas have closed. Many people work in the home office. The restaurants are very less visited at lunchtime. The universities have switched to distance lessons, as well as the skylights of Swedish high schools. And yet Sweden is currently working like an island of lucky in a Europe of contact and starting locks in which public life has almost completely reached. The kindergartens and schools up to the class nine are open, children play on the playgrounds, on the football fields are kicked. In front of the royal theater, people sit with a coffee mug in the spring sun. From time to time, a ferry puts out into the archipelago. So, as if nothing had happened. Is Sweden spared the Coronavirus or ignores the government in the largest Scandinavian country? The man, who so far so abandoned by the crisis, is different Tegnell, the Supreme State Epidemiologist. He belongs to the authority for public health. Thus, Folkh\u00e4lsomyndignheten can be translated into German. Almost every day at 2 pm, the 63-year-old appears in front of the press and proclaimed the latest figures with his colleagues and colleagues and the recommendations of his authority. Mostly he carries a slightly washed out sweater and chino pants. When Tegnell emits its statement, it often fluctuates back and forth. Like a Nordic pine in the wind. In fact, Tegnell gets a lot of resistance at the moment. His course in this crisis is quite controversial in Sweden. He is admired on the one hand, gets flowers and encouragement, but louder are the critics - also from their own field. Finally, the coronavirus did not stop before Sweden. Nearly 2,300 infected authorities include the authorities until the beginning of this week. 36 patients are died until this Tuesday at the consequences of Covid-19. \"It's bloody serious,\" says Fredrik Elgh, Professor of Clinical Microbiology at the University of Ume\u00e5. In an email, he has turned to Tegnell with other professionals in Tegnell to get married. In an interview with the Swedish television, the physician said: \"I'm deeply worried in the face of development. I would like to quarantine all Stockholm.\" Sweden is practically the only country in the world, which does not help everything to stop the spread of the virus. Together with 13 other scientists, ELGH has once again reorganized in a contribution to the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter on Wednesday and more transparency demanded by the public health authority. Tegnell and his colleagues \nShould your data and calculation models disclose. The neighboring states of Denmark and Norway have long been surprising to the Sweden. From the unity of the Scandinavian countries in times of crisis, little can be felt in the case of Corona. Why are the kindergartens and elementary schools open in Sweden despite increasing infection numbers? Why is there no contact lock as in Germany? Tegnell responds almost always to these recurring questions: the epidemiological benefits of school closures in the case of coronavirus be doubtful. Neither Italy nor in China had proven to be a distribution hotspots for the virus. According to investigations of the World Health Organization WHO in China, there is no single occupancy that has begun an adult at a child. Why should you then retain tens of thousands of healthy children at home? Especially since many parents who work in important professions for crisis control could no longer go to work? Tegnells Credo: \"All measures we meet must also be feasible over a longer period of time.\" Otherwise, you will lose the acceptance for the entire corona strategy in the population. The Swedish way can be used to reduce epidemiologically on two basic rules. Older or healthy preliminary people should be isolated as well. So no visitors or grandchildren, no trips by public transport, if possible, no purchases. That's a rule. The other is: all who have symptoms should stay home immediately, even at the lowest cough. \"If you follow these two rules, you do not need any other measures whose effect is very marginal anyway,\" repeats Tegnell. He says that's exactly the evening when the contact lock is proclaimed in Germany. The Swedish health authorities rely on their course on a basic assumption, which is quite controversial in other countries. People without symptoms are considered not contagious. With this reference, all Swedish doctors also draw in the fight against the virus. In any case, the Swedish policy, especially the Social Democratic Prime Minister Stefan L\u00f6fven, followed the recommendations of his epidemiologists. \"We trust our authorities,\" says L\u00f6fven. The big onslaught on the hospitals was at least developed so far. Every day, which passes, could be a sign that the curve will rise slightly flatter than feared. Another circumstance makes the Sweden hope: It is the age distribution in the previously infected. The largest part lies in the age group between 40 and 59. Most of them have brought the virus when skiing in Italy and Austria. The risk, difficult to illuminate, is rather low in this group. By contrast, the number of infected ones, which are 70 years and older, is still relative \nsmall. This could be an explanation why so far the disease courses in Sweden are less dramatic than in other countries. And another theory makes the round. Unlike in the south of Europe, the Swedes lived rather in a spatial distance to each other. Several generations are rarely united under one roof. And the southern European kiss on the cheek for greeting is rather unusual in Sweden. The relatively slow spread of the virus in Sweden could be a receipt that different Tegnell does not completely false with its defensive strategy. But finally, this can be done only after the dismissal of the pandemic. Therefore, Sweden wants to provide and set up his hospitals. With the help of the military, two emergency lazarette for corona infected are currently being built. One of which is created in the Stockholm exhibition halls. Because regularly there are only 90 intensive care beds in the Swedish capital. In an emergency, a multiple of beds would be needed. You want to be prepared for that. That Sweden goes his own way, one sees currently in the winter sports areas of the country. Almost everywhere in Europe, ski tourism has come to a standstill. Also in the neighboring country Norway, the season was terminated prematurely. But in Sweden, the lifts continue. Finally, Easter is on. There is an integral part for many of the holidays in the mountains. After the first Corona Falls in the winter sports resort of \u00c5re, however, a premature season end in Sweden was now a discussion. But the health authority did not want to go that far. Gondolas are closed. The skiers should stop in the prime on the lift. In restaurants and huts, only at the table may be eaten or drunk. But otherwise the operation can continue on Easter. So Sweden continue their own way. How the different countries deal with the virus - so it is also in the ARD World Mail Podcast this week.

Less than six months from the opening ceremony of the Tokyo Olympic Games, Japanese organizers are concerned about the impact that coronavirus can have in the preparation of the event. Not only worried, they are \"extremely worried\", as Toshiro Muto, executive director of the Games Organizing Committee, which are held this summer between July 24 and August 9. \"We are extremely concerned about the sense in which the spread of the virus can be a bucket of cold water in the preparation of the games. I hope it is eradicated as soon as possible, \"muto declared.\nThe truth is that it is already affecting, with the cancellation or change of date and location of several events that serve as Olympic qualification originally scheduled for Chinese territory, and is difficult to predict the effects of the various containment and combat virusements in the organization of games, as in the competitive plane. \"This situation worries us, in the games plan and the preparation plan for the games.

From the point of view of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), we have not yet received any indication. What we know is what we are going to see in the media. The last time we were in Tokyo, gathered as the Organizing Committee, there were no references to risks or reserves or concerns in relation to this matter. But this creates a very complicated picture in relation to the tranquility with which the preparation of the games should be done, \"said COP president, ensuring that he has received no request for clarification by Portuguese athletes.\nThe games organization expects about 40 million foreign visitors in Tokyo during the games beyond about 11,000 athletes from all over the world. Tokyo is about 2400km from Wuhan (epidemic epicenter), and out of mainland China, Japan is the country with more registered cases of coronavirus patients (33), but without any death resulting from infection. The geographical proximity between China and Japan promoted the appearance of news that Tokyo games could be canceled, news that motivated a vehement response from the organization and the ICO itself denying this hypothesis.\nSubscribe newsletters for free and receive the best of the publicity and the deepest jobs of the public.\n\"We are confident that the authorities will take all necessary steps. Countermeasures against infectious diseases are an important part of Tokyo 2020 plan in organizing safe games, \"said a COI spokesman cited by BBC. A meeting between the Japanese Ministry of Health is scheduled for the end of the Games and other competent authorities to analyze the situation.\nThis is not the first time you are attending a global emergency a few months from the Olympic Games. Four years ago, on the eve of Rio 2016, the World Health Organization considered the Zika virus epidemic as an international public health emergency, considering, however, that there was a very low risk of the disease having an international spread by the games If they realize in Brazil, the country most affected by the virus. Still, there were several athletes who chose not to go to the river games because of Zika, such as Golfer Rory Mcilroy, or Semona Halep tennis player - no athlete who was in the 2016 games was infected with Zika. \"Fortunately everything went well. At that time, the Director General of Health has made training with our mission, \"recalls Jos\u00e9 Manuel Constantine. \"For Tokyo, whoever realizes the subject that tells us what we have to do, to prepare for a possible risk.\" ", "label": 1}, {"content": "There are six people infected with Coronavirus in Macau.

2019-2020 coronavirus outbreak in 1981. posts featuring the cover of \u201cthe eyes of darkness\u201d book and a page in which koontz allegedly describes the coronavirus in his novel have at least 39,000 shares (examples here and here) and at least 2,000 retweets on twitter (examples here and here) as of february 27, 2020. most of the claims circulating on social media show the book\u2019s cover and a page in the book mentioning a virus called \u201cwuhan-400\u201d. the widely circulated photo of koontz\u2019s book page includes some highlighted text reading: \u201cthey call the stuff \u2018wuhan-400\u2019 because it was developed at their rdna labs outside of the city of wuhan, and it was the four-hundredth viable strain of man-made microorganisms created at that research center\u201d. some claims circulating also include an additional page that mentions the year 2020 and the outbreak of a \u201csevere pneumonia-like illness\u201d. this is partly false. while it is true that koontz wrote about a fictional virus in his novel and that its name \u201cwuhan-400\u201d refers the chinese city in which the 2019 coronavirus outbreak (covid-19) (here) actually started, the illness in his book doesn\u2019t share more traits with covid-19. in his novel, koontz described \u201cwuhan-400\u201d as \u201cchina\u2019s most important and dangerous: new biological weapon in a decade\u201d. he also wrote it was developed by labs outside of the city of wuhan. there is no proof that the new coronavirus was created in a lab. the virus is believed to have originated late last year in a food market in wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife (see here). health experts think it may have originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via another species. reuters looked at further references of \u201cwuhan-400\u201d in koontz\u2019s book. the symptoms and behavior of koontz\u2019s \u201cwuhan-400\u201d are very different to covid-19. in the novel, the virus has an incubation period of \u201conly four hours\u201d. covid-19\u2019s incubation period is between 1-14 days. according to world health organization (here), the most common incubation time is around five days. koontz also describes \u201cwuhan-400\u201d as a disease with a \u201ckill-rate\u201d of a 100%. \u201conce infected, no one lives more than twenty-four hours. most die in twelve\u201d, he writes. covid-19\u2019s death rate is far from this, according to the who, the case-fatality rate is between 2% and 4% in wuhan and 0.7% outside wuhan (here). the symptoms described by koontz are different to covid-19. in his novel, \u201cwuhan-400\u201d causes the secretion of a \u201ctoxin that literally eats away brain tissue\u201d causing loss of control of bodily function. \u201cthe victim simply ceases to have a pulse, functioning organs, or any urge to breathe\u201d, writes koontz. meanwhile covid-19 infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, coughing, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. mild cases can cause cold-like \nsymptoms, while severe cases can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory illness, kidney failure and death. in the novel, \u201cwuhan-400\u201d is described to be \u201cinfinitely worse\u201d than ebola (evd), but covid-19 is less threatening than evd. according to the who, the average evd case fatality rate is around 50%, while case fatality rates have varied from 25% to 90% in past outbreaks (see here). the new coronavirus death-rate is between 2% and 4% in wuhan and 0.7% outside wuhan. it is worth noting that in the first edition of \u201cthe eyes of darkness\u201d in 1981, the fictional virus was not named after the chinese city, but after a russian locality named \u201cgorki\u201d (gorki-400). in the original version of the novel, the virus was developed outside of \u201cgorki\u201d and it was meant to be the \u201csoviet\u2019s most important, dangerous new biological weapon in the decade\u201d. this is confirmed by a google books\u2019 search of the word \u201cwuhan\u201d in the 1981 edition (here). in this edition \u201cwuhan-400\u201d brings no results. according to the south china morning post, the name of the virus was changed on the re-release of the book in 1989, toward the end of the cold war. their article here includes photographs of the previous edition that references \u201cgorki-400\u201d). in this edition, koontz also published his novel under his real name instead of using his pseudonym \u201cleigh nichols\u201d. reuters tried to contact the author and the publisher but is yet to receive an answer. some of the posts on social media also share a third image of a book page without any attribution (here), wrongly suggesting it is part of the same book. this page reads: \u201cin around 2020 a severe pneumonia-like illness will spread throughout the globe, attacking the lungs and the bronchial tubes and resisting all known treatments\u201d. this page does not belong to \u201cthe eyes of darkness\u201d. it comes from the 2008 book \u201cend of days: predictions and prophecies about the end of the world\u201d by sylvia browne, an american author who claimed to be a psychic (see the page here). this claim is therefore partly false. dean koontz did write about a fictional virus called \u201cwuhan-400\u201d in the 1989 re-release of his 1981 novel \u201cthe eyes of darkness\u201d, but symptoms and effects of the disease do not match the official description of covid-19. the additional page present in some claims suggesting an outbreak \u201caround 2020\u201d is from a different book. partly false: dean kootz wrote about a fictional virus called \u201cwuhan-400\u201d, but its description has nothing to do with the new

treatments for the new coronavirus, using a variety of different technologies.   according to mr benjamin neuman, a virologist at texas a&m university-texarkana, immunizing against the pathogen is a long shot: there has never been a very successful human vaccine against any member of the coronavirus family.   \"this is going to be a lot of trial, a lot of error, but we have a lot of options to try,\" mr neuman said.   treatment could come sooner, with antiviral remdesivir showing early promise and already being used on an ad hoc basis before regulatory approval.   us president donald trump has urged his scientists and drug companies to speed up the process\u00a0\u2014 but experts say fundamental constraints could leave little wiggle room.   \"a vaccine has to have a fundamental scientific basis. it has to be manufacturable. it has to be safe. this could take a year and a half\u00a0\u2014 or much longer,\" wrote mr h. holden thorp, the editor-in-chief of the journal science in response to the president's calls.   \"pharmaceutical executives have every incentive to get there quickly\u00a0\u2014 they will be selling the vaccine after all \u2014 but thankfully, they also know that you can't break the laws of nature to get there.\"   the united states is funding several companies through the department of health and human services (hhs) and national institutes of health (nih).\u00a0   the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations (cepi), a global organization based in oslo, is also helping to fund many companies, mostly smaller partners that would lack the capacity to scale-up mass production. it has so far provided about $24 million.   gilead sciences   what it is: treatment   when it might come: later this year   of all the drugs linked to the virus that causes covid-19, gilead's remdesivir could be the closest to market launch. it's actually not new per se but was developed to fight other viruses including ebola (where it was shown to be ineffective) and it hasn't yet been approved for anything.\u00a0   still, it has shown early promise in treating some coronavirus patients in china, according to doctors, and gilead is moving ahead with final stage clinical trials in asia (known as \"phase 3\"). it has also been used to treat at least one us patient so far.   nih's anthony fauci, one of the top government scientists overseeing the coronavirus response, has said it could be available in the next \"several months.\"   \"there's only one drug right now that we think may have real efficacy. and that's remdesivir,\" said mr bruce aylward, a world health organization (who) official at a recent press conference in china.   remdesivir gets modified inside the human body to become similar to one of the four building blocks of dna, called nucleotides.\u00a0   mr neuman told afp that when viruses copy themselves, they do it \"quickly and a bit sloppily,\" \nmeaning they might incorporate remdevisir into their structure\u00a0\u2014 though human cells, which are more fastidious, won't make the same mistake.   if the virus incorporates the remdesivir into itself, the drug adds unwanted mutations that can destroy the virus.   moderna   what it is: vaccine   when it might come: 12-18 months\u00a0   within weeks of chinese researchers making the genome of the virus public, a team at the university of texas at austin was able to create a replica model of its spike protein, the part which attaches to and infects human cells, and image it using a cryogenic (cooled) electron microscope.   this replica itself is now the basis for a vaccine candidate because it may provoke an immune response in the human body without causing harm\u00a0\u2014 the classical method for developing vaccines based on principles dating back to smallpox vaccine in 1796.   nih is also working with moderna, a relatively new firm founded in 2010, to make a vaccine using the protein's genetic information to grow it inside human muscle tissue, rather than having to inject it in.   this information is stored in an intermediary transient substance called \"messenger rna\" that carries genetic code from dna to cells.\u00a0   \"the advantage is that it's really fast,\" explained mr jason mclellan, who led the ut austin team, whereas the traditional approach of creating the protein outside is difficult to scale and takes a long time.   the vaccine began its first human trial on march 16 after being proven effective in mice.\u00a0   if all goes to plan, it could be available on the market in about a year and a half, ready in case the coronavirus outbreak continues until the next flu season, according to dr fauci.   regeneron   what it is: treatment and vaccine   when it might come: firm timeline not yet provided   regeneron last year developed an intravenous drug that was shown to significantly boost survival rates among ebola patients using what are known as \"monoclonal antibodies.\"   to do this, they genetically modified mice to give them human-like immune systems. the mice are exposed to viruses, or weakened forms of them, in order to produce human antibodies, mr christos kyratsous, the company's vice president of research told afp.   these antibodies are then isolated and screened to find the most potent ones, which are grown in labs, purified and given to humans intravenously.   \"if everything goes well, we should know what our best antibodies are within the next few weeks,\" with human trials to begin by summer, said mr kyratsous.   the drug could work as both a treatment and as a vaccine, by dosing up people before they are exposed\u00a0\u2014 though these effects would be only temporary.\u00a0   in the near term, they are also trying to repurpose another of their drugs devised using the same platform called kevzara, which is approved to treat inflammation caused by arthritis.\u00a0   this could help fight the lung inflammation seen in the severe forms of the covid-19 disease\u00a0\u2014 in other words \nfighting a symptom as opposed to the virus itself.   sanofi   what it is: vaccine   when it might come: time not yet clear   the french drugmaker is partnering with the us government to use a so-called \"recombinant dna platform\" to produce a vaccine candidate.   it takes the virus' dna and combines it with dna from a harmless virus, creating a chimera that can provoke an immune response.\u00a0   the antigens it produces can then be scaled up.\u00a0   the technology is already the basis of sanofi's influenza vaccine, and believes it has a head start due to a sars vaccine it developed that offered partial protection in animals.\u00a0   mr david loew, the company's head of vaccines, is reported to have said sanofi expects to have a research candidate ready for lab testing within six months and for clinical study within a year and a half.   inovio pharmaceuticals   what it is: vaccine   when it might come: emergency supplies by end of year?   inovio, another us biopharmaceutical, has since its founding in the 1980s worked on dna vaccines\u00a0\u2014 which work in a similar way to rna vaccines explained above but work at an earlier link of the chain.   as an analogy, dna can be thought of as a reference book in a library, while rna is like a photocopy of a page from that book containing instructions to carry out a task.   \"we plan to begin human clinical trials in the us in april and soon thereafter in china and south korea, where the outbreak is impacting the most people,\" said mr j. joseph kim, inovio's president and ceo in a statement.   \"we plan on delivering one million doses by year end with existing resources and capacity.\"   other notable efforts   british drugmaker glaxosmithkline has teamed up with a chinese biotech firm, providing adjuvant platform technology.   an adjuvant is added to some vaccines to enhance the immune response, thereby creating a stronger and longer lasting immunity against infections than the vaccine alone.   like moderna, curevac is working with\u00a0 the university of queensland on a messenger rna vaccine. its ceo daniel menichella met with the white house earlier this month, and announced the company expects to have a candidate within a few months.   american pharma johnson & johnson is looking at repurposing some of its existing drugs to see how they might help treat the symptoms of patients already infected with the virus.\u00a0   it's also working on developing a vaccine involving a deactivated version of the pathogen.   california-based vir biotechnology has isolated antibodies from sars survivors and is looking to see if these can treat the new coronavirus. its platform has previously developed treatments for ebola and other diseases.   even the likes of chloroquine\u00a0\u2014 the synthetic form of quinine, used to treat malaria, may have some properties that fight the virus and scientists are calling for more work to investigate.

", "label": 1}, {"content": "New Coronavirus: 20 questions about what is known (and do not know). At the end of last year the alert appeared: several people were infected with the virus that has not yet known, responsible for respiratory problems. At the beginning of January Chinese health authorities has isolated a new coronavirus. There is still a lot of information that it takes to determine, such as the source of infection and the most detailed form of how the person transmission is given. On 30 January the World Health Organization (WHO) declared an international public health emergency, but it opposes travel and trade restrictions. This Tuesday, WHO stated that it is not a pandemic but an epidemic with multiple outbreaks. Thousands of people have already been infected and a few hundred died. The public has consulted the information available in the WHO, in the European Demost Control and Prevention Center (ECDC) and in the General Directorate of Portuguese Health and makes it a point of the situation about what is already known and still not. What are Coronavirus? Coronavirus (COV) are a large family of viruses that cause respiratory diseases, which can go from a simple constipation to more serious situations such as the respiratory respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS-COV) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV), explains WHO. Seen to the microscope, the coronaviruses seem to have a crown of thorns around him and that name. Why is it say that this is a new coronavirus? Because so far this strain has not yet been identified. Since the first cases of infection emerged, at the end of 2019 in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, several scientists studied the genome of this new coronavirus (2019-NCOV). To which it was possible to conclude, it has a resemblance to SARS virus in the order of 89%. How do you give the transmission? It is known that coronaviruses are transmitted between animals and people. In the case of SARS, the transmission was through city cats and MERS through dromedaries. According to information on the WHO website, there are several coronaviruses identified in animals in which there has not yet been transmission for people. On the new coronavirus (2019-NCOV) the source of infection is still unknown and so ECDC admits that it may be active. When and where the first cases of the new coronavirus have been detected? At 31 December last year, WHO was informed by the Chinese authorities of the existence of cases of pneumonia of unknown origin. were detected in the city of Wuhan. The new coronavirus was identified by the Chinese authorities on 7 January. At that time, the authorities spoke at least 59 people with the disease. Most cases are epidemiologically associated with a specific market for live food and animals (fish, seafood and birds) in Wuhan. The market was clean and closed to the public on 1 January. Is this new coronavirus comparable to SARS or the seasonal influenza? For already, the lethality rate of the new coronavirus has oscillated between 2% \nand 3%. ECDC recalls that information on 2019-NCOV is still limited, but in the case of SARS, epidemic that emerged at the end of 2002 also in China, the virus infected more than 8000 thousand people in 33 countries in eight months. 774 deaths were recorded, which represented a 10% lethality rate. At Mers, identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, the rate of lethality is estimated at 35%. Compared to the flu, despite presenting the same symptoms, \"the two viruses are very different and, consequently, behave differently,\" explains ECDC, which estimates that annually die prematurely up to 40,000 people in the European Causes associated with the flu. Only in Portugal in the 2018/2019 gripal season they died about 3000 people. Is there a person's transmission to person? Chinese health authorities confirmed that the virus is transmissible among humans, although mechanisms are not yet fully known. There is still not enough information to determine how easy and sustainable it is the transmission of person to person. To the public, DGS had already explained that the \"sustained person-to-person transmission means that the infection transmission chains are forming progressively giving up secondary, tertiary and so successively.\" What is the incubation period of the disease? DGS explained to the public that, \"according to WHO, is, on average, 7 days being able to extend two to 12 days.\" But it can reach 14 days. There is currently an indication that the virus can be transmitted even before the infected person presenting symptoms. What is the transmission mode? According to WHO, this is a respiratory virus \"that spreads mainly by contact with an infected person through respiratory droplets generated when a person, for example, cough or sneezing, or through saliva or secretion droplets nasal\". Preliminary information indicates that the new coronavirus can survive a few hours on surfaces. Before suspicious or confirmed cases a disinfectant solution should be used to clean the surfaces. What cells are affected? In an interview with the public, the pneumologist and representative of the Order of Physicians for the issues linked to the new Coronavirus Filipe Froce explained that the affected cells are those of the respiratory apparatus. \"The main connection element to enter the cells is probably a receiver called ACE2, which is a more predominant receptor in the lower respiratory apparatus,\" he explained, referring that it is not known for another receiver. What symptoms causes the most common signs include fever, cough, shortness of air and respiratory difficulties, according to WHO. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, renal failure and death. Are there groups at a higher risk of contagion? People of all ages may be affected, but so far, of what is known, have been the oldest people and / or with chronic diseases such as diabetes, \nHypertension or heart disease those that have developed more severe frames of the disease. Is there any treatment or vaccine? There is no specific treatment for this infection. What is being done is to give support care, such as oxygen, fluid and antiviral management to avoid the emergence of other infections and keep patient stable. Chinese authorities are working on creating a vaccine, which claim to be testing. More laboratories are working on it. How to prevent contagion? DGS recommends travelers to avoid close contact with people who have signs of respiratory infections; Frequently wash your hands, especially after direct contact with sick people; Avoid contact with animals; to cover the nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing with paper handkerchief or arm and wash their hands always. \"Travelers with a history of travel or permanence in the affected areas in the last 14 days that present fever, coughing and possible respiratory difficulty, should, before seeking health services, calling SNS24 - 808 24 24\", recommends DGS. Should you use mask? Mask use can help limit the spread of the disease when serving as a barrier to the issuance of droplets. However, WHO recommends the use of masks if you have respiratory symptoms, suspect it may be infected or if you have been with someone suspected of being infected. Is it safe to receive orders from China? Yes, tell the WHO. \"From experience with other coronaviruses, we know that these types of viruses do not survive much to objects such as letters or packages,\" he explains. ECDC adds that \"there is no evidence that food products imported into the European Union, in accordance with applicable public and animal health regulations governing imports from China, represent a health risk.\" Are there foreign citizens to be withdrawn from the city of Wuhan? At the end of January the European Civil Protection Mechanism was activated at the request of France. Several countries, including Portugal, withdrew citizens who were living in the Wuhan city, which is the epicenter of the epidemic. The group of 20 citizens who arrived in Portugal - where two citizens of Brazilian nationality are included - is in a voluntary quarantine at the pulido hospital Valente and in the Health Park in Lisbon. What has been done to control the transmission? DGS summarizes that since January 23 and by decision of Chinese authorities all flights and public transport were canceled in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province. Also in other neighboring cities were implemented similar measures, and cinemas and other public spaces were interrupted with people concentration.A China has also implemented health screening measures for travelers at the exit of the country at airports, ports and borders terrestrials. Also other countries are limiting the entry of people who have been in China less than 14 \ndays, although there is no WHO recommendation so that there are border cuts. What measures does Portugal have? Portugal has implemented an action protocol to cases that can be considered suspects. Anyone who thinks have symptoms or has doubts should contact the SNS 24 line instead of addressing a health center or hospital. To the person must be made an inquiry to realize whether there are symptoms and if they were in the affected area or with people who show symptoms and who have been in the affected area. The person should, in case of suspected infection, be isolated and wear a mask. Professionals should also use protection. The health professional should contact the medical support line for validation or not the case. There are Means of INEM designated for the transport of suspected cases to the three reference hospitals - Curry Cabral and Dona Estef\u00e2nia (Lisbon) and S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o (Porto). Other units may receive these citizens, following the indications of DGS. Nearby contacts should be watched.

Ricardo Jorge is the reference laboratory in Portugal for testing to prove the presence or not the infection by the new coronavirus. The results can be obtained at the end of five to six hours. Can Portugal control China's arrival flights? No. At a press conference, the Director General for Health Grace Freitas explained that \"the screening must be done on exit and China\", following WHO indications. \"In SARS and other epidemics, from thousands people crawled at entry [this practice] has not led to the detection of any case. The widespread screening is not considered a suitable screening, \"he said, still said the responsible. What is the risk in Europe? The possibility of importing cases for EU / EEA countries \"is moderate to high\". However, the probability of secondary transmission in EU / EEA \"is low, provided that infection prevention and infection control practices relating to an eventual case\". While there are cases registered in several countries in Europe, the number is very limited and several have travel link to the city of Wuhan, China.

rarer symptoms included headache and diarrhoea. most had been healthy until they contracted the virus.   despite similar symptoms to sars such as fever and shortness of breath, there are also key differences, including the absence of upper respiratory tract symptoms and intestinal sickness, according to bin cao, lead author from the china-japan friendship hospital and capital medical university in china.   the second study published in the lancet focused on person-to-person transmission and inter-city spread of the virus in a family in china.   six members of the family travelled to wuhan from shenzhen between dec 29 last year and jan 4.   \"of six family members who travelled to wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.   \"additionally, one family member, who did not travel to wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members,\" according to the study.   the patients arrived at the university of hong kong-shenzhen hospital in shenzhen six to 10 days after the onset of their symptoms, wrote dr jasper fuk-woo chan, from the hospital's department of clinical microbiology and infection control, in the study which was co-authored by more than a dozen other colleagues.   none of the family members had contacts with wuhan markets or animals, although two had been to a wuhan hospital to visit sick relatives, the authors said.   five family members, aged between 36 and 66, developed fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these three to six days after exposure, the study said.   on sunday, china's national health commission minister ma xiaowei told reporters that the authorities' knowledge of the new virus was limited and they are unclear on the risks posed by mutations of the virus.   he said the incubation period for the coronavirus can range from one to 14 days, and that the virus is infectious during incubation.   this was not the case with sars, which originated in china and killed nearly 800 people globally in 2002 and 2003.   a clinical trial is underway using anti-hiv drugs ritonavir and lopinavir to treat patients infected with the new virus, according to a separate article published in the lancet on friday. \nbeijing's municipal health commission said on sunday the drugs made by abbvie inc are part of the national health commission's latest treatment plan, and its hospitals have supplies of the medicine if needed.

who took office in december - exchanged correspondence with chinese leader xi jinping.    in letters seen by reuters, fernandez offered solidarity to china in february as the virus raged from the outbreak center of wuhan. in march, xi replied that the situation in china was improving and he called for a deepening of ties between the two nations.    days later, the chinese embassy announced its donations, posting pictures on twitter of large trucks carrying a mobile hospital that was set up within a military base near the argentine capital.    \"china will continue to help in all possible channels. long live friendship!\" the embassy said on twitter.    the help came at a difficult time \nfor argentina, which is grappling with a severe economic crisis and re-negotiating $110 billion in foreign debt with creditors, including the international monetary fund.    \"this is part of the link we have with china, which is a solid relationship of mutual respect and ties that go beyond strong trade,\" a spokesman for argentina's foreign ministry told reuters, when asked about the donations.       information control    china's aid to latin america reflects a broader global trend, as beijing looks to steer the narrative away from it being the country where the coronavirus started and was initially downplayed. instead, china wants to be seen as spearheading the global fight against the pandemic, experts say.    luo zhaohui, a vice minister at china's foreign ministry, said at a news conference in beijing on thursday that the country would \"ride out the storm with people from other countries, strengthen cooperation and strive to win the last victory in the fight against the virus.\"    while trump has been criticized by opponents for branding the pandemic 'the chinese virus,' china has won praise among latin american governments that have accepted its help. the chinese government said it has supplied test kits, protective suits and other forms of medical aid to more than 80 countries and international organizations.    \"it's remarkable and a credit, in a way, to china's own commanding control of information that it's been able to re-envision itself as a leader in the fight against coronavirus globally,\" said margaret myers, director of the china and latin american program at the washington-based inter-american dialogue.    myers said the recent re-start of chinese industry, as cases have subsided, has enabled the country to be a provider of key products as the rest of the world's production slows.    \"this will create opportunities for china in the coming years,\" she said.    the united states, meanwhile, is struggling with its own battle to contain the virus, with the world health organization warning on tuesday that the country could become a new epicenter of the crisis.    before the epidemic hit hardest, washington in february pledged $100 million towards international efforts in combating covid-19, including for developing nations. a regional breakdown of that funding was not immediately available.       thank you, china    in latin america, china's hands-on approach has been well received.    chile, which has among the highest numbers of coronavirus cases in the region, has sought advice from chinese health officials to guide its response and is sending an air force plane to china to pick up donated supplies, including tests and respiratory equipment, chile's health minister said.    in mexico, officials have said they are awaiting 300 ventilators from china, crucial yet scarce equipment in treating patients, while in panama, government health officials heralded a video conference with chinese experts to work on strategy, something china \nhas done with more than 100 countries.    in venezuela, the government of president nicolas maduro said china would send protective gear for health professionals and coronavirus test kits. the country has also opened talks with china over possible financial support.    \"thank you china for cooperation and solidarity with ecuador!\" the country's vice president otto sonnenholzner wrote on twitter, itemizing help from china that he said included 40,000 surgical masks, infrared thermometers, and protective suits.    in brazil, right-wing president jair bolsonaro has moved quickly to heal a diplomatic rift with china and chinese officials have said beijing would assist with medical supplies and technical assistance.    chinese firms, including alibaba, huawei, cofco, china communications construction and the bank of china have pledged donations around the region.    back in argentina, washington is keen to show that it also wants to help.    \"we plan this week to make funds available to argentine authorities to combat coronavirus,\" an official at the u.s. embassy in buenos aires told reuters, adding the country was \"looking at the possibility of additional donations.\" reuters ", "label": 1}, {"content": "Lung disease in China spreads rapidly.

At the same time, official statistics take into account only confirmed cases of coronavirus infection. The real number of dead may be more several times. Why is it that the epidemic has developed so rapidly and with such tragic consequences? \"For each of the dead from COVID-19, there are still three people who died from pneumonia at home without any tests,\" said Georgeo Gori, the mayor of Bergamo in Lombardy. By Thursday in this province, more than 32 thousand infected were confirmed. On Monday, almost 2000 new cases of infection and more than 400 deaths were recorded there. Since then, the growth rates of the \"official\" epidemic went a little on the decline. However, according to the press secretary of the Italian Federation of the general practitioners of Poole Pedrini, in reality things are much worse. \"A significant part of infected is not reflected in the statistics of confirmed cases, since they simply do not conduct a test [on COVID-19].

At that time, around 70,000 patients with coronavirus were officially numbered around the world, more than 90% of them are in the territory of the mainland China. Just a month later, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy took off almost 50 thousand, more than 4,000 patients were killed. The explanation of such a sharp jump was offered on March 20, a team of Italian scientists. The retrospective study conducted by them showed that by the time of the first diagnosis of SARS-COV-2 has long been shopping in most cities of Lombardy \"Incognito\" - that is, undiagnosed. And each of his carrier infected at least three healthy people. The average age of the surveyed patients is 69 years, although there are a monthly baby among them, and 101-year-old woman. Hospitalization took almost half of the patients from which each fifth later translated into intensive care. The authors of the published work do not indicate when the outbreak of a new disease began, limiting the vague wording \"much earlier than February 20.\" Professor Biology Enrico Buchci from \nPhiladelphia University offers a significantly more accurate chronology. According to him, SARS-COV-2 was brought to Italy no later than mid-December. Bucci outlined his arguments in a week after setting the first diagnosis in a scientific blog. In particular, the Professor paid attention to the fact that on the last week of December in the hospital of the city of Piacenza, just a few kilometers from Codono, at the same time, more than 40 patients with inflammation of the lungs were treated at the same time - and then the local press wrote about it with surprise. By the end of February, the patients cured from pneumonia found antibodies to a new coronavirus, which only confirmed the suspicions of Buchchi: these people moved COVID-19 even before WHO gave a new virus name. By the time the Italian epidemic was killed as a thunder among the clear sky officially, in fact she was already growing unnoticed for more than two months. Influenza with Kosychdogo, it was Coronavirus who didn't get into Italy, it is unknown. Genetic analysis shows that it flew after all of China. It is impossible to exclude that the virus first penetrates at about the same time at the beginning or middle of December. However, it was in Italy that the grain of infection fell into particularly fertile soil. In recent years, mortality from ordinary seasonal flu in Italy, especially among the elderly population (65+), is about twice as much as the Middle Equipment. In November last year, the team of Italian doctors estimated that from 2013 to 2017 the influenza epidemic in the country took almost 70 thousand lives \"above the norm\". In winter, 2016-2017 The influenza mortality rate in Italy exceeded 40 cases per 100 thousand people. For comparison: the average mortality from breast cancer or prostate in the world is about 10 per 100 thousand people; Malaria has 20; Tuberculosis - 25; HIV / AIDS - 44. There are several possible explanations for this. First, the average age of the population. \"The increased mortality rate cannot be called absolutely unexpected, given the number of patients living in Italy in Italy,\" the researchers write. If the average age of Italian patients who have confirmed coronavirus is 63 years old, then in Germany - 45 years. The second possible reason is the increased use of antibiotics in Italy. These drugs do not act on viruses, but contribute to the emergence of resistant infections that can greatly complicate the state of severely ill. According to statistics, the Italians are on average two times more antibiotics than other residents of the European Union. Italian farmers growing animals are again used for their treatment twice as many antibiotics than on average in the EU. It is one of the way that resistant infections in Italian hospitals are found more often more often. In general, as mentioned above, Coronavirus grain fell in Italy to highly prepared soil. And the widespread epidemic, according to many experts, was greatly contributed to the football match, which took place 19 \nFebruary in Milan. Almost 50 thousand people came to the game from Bergamo - most of them public transport. The first Italian patient with Coronavirus, Alzano Lombardo, was diagnosed the next day. Nikolai Voronin Spristen on Science TVs ", "label": 1}, {"content": "With suspicion of coronavirus to the doctor's waiting room? In Germany, the new Coronavirus 2019-NCOV was found so far with four people. No comparison to the thousands infected in China. But the occurrence of the virus falls into a period in which many people are cold in this country - and the symptoms of both disorders are resembling themselves. So when is a cough of a cough and when a case for the family doctor or even for the hospital? Philipp Leson explained by the German Society for General Medicine and Family Medicine (Degam) who is a suspicion of the right contact person, and what happens when a patient or a patient actually determines the new virus. Time online: cough, fever, breathing problems - the first symptoms of the coronavirus 2019-NCOV are not unusual in the cold time. Who do I turn now if they occur in these days - to my family doctor or directly to a specialist? Philipp Leson: Even at the present time, where there are only a few cases in Germany, the first point of contact with these symptoms is naturally as otherwise your family doctor. Nothing changed about that. This looks different, however, if you really have a justified suspicion. For example, because they have just come from the region around Wuhan in China to Germany and now find these symptoms with themselves or they had contacted someone who has been demonstrably illness. Time online: If I call and say at the family doctor, seeing my complaints - I will then be asked automatically if I had contact to China? Leson: That depends on the way you arise. If you just call with these symptoms in practice and ask for an appointment, the medical staff will probably not ask the phone on the phone. Often, the time is missing to enter there in a real history conversation. But if you call with the concrete hint \"I was in China and have the following symptoms,\" then it can be good that the closer is discussed. Time online: Is there guidelines for family doctors, how to behave in such cases? Leson: No, a concrete guideline is not there. Of course, there are the guidelines issued by the German Society for General Medicine and Family Medicine for various consulting and treatment events, which includes, for example, the cough. There are then concrete processes called. However, the DEGAM currently recommends to clarify with fever in each patient in which countries he and his contact persons lasted. At the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities of the World Health Organization WHO reported an accumulation of pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause in the Central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified \nNovel virus as the cause of the diseases. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days then a group released a group of the virologen Christian's premier from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 the first diagnostic test for the new virus, the researcher provisionally call 2019-NCOV. With the test, the virus can be detected in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, on which, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected. Both the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as well as Mers (MIDDLE East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses which have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more than 750 died. With the MERS virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronaviruses. Many of them relate to respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example. In China, several thousand persons are suffering from them, some of them - most of them with pre-existing conditions - have died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first infection cases outside of China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been in Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection with a tourist, who came back from Wuhan, on January 24, the first cases were known in France. Meanwhile, first cases were confirmed in Germany. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. The virus can cause pneumonia that can endally end. Since it is a viral illness, antibiotics do not help. Meanwhile, it is clear that the virus can be transferred from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transfers after a dozen cases were known in medical staff. Medizors assume that the virus is transmitted above all over droplet infection. The World Health Organization calculates, as announced on January 24, at the moment that an infected one cuts 1.4 to 2.5 other people. Contest these numbers, the virus is less contagious than SARS and also the viral flu. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals. That can not be said yet. The World Health Organization said on 28 January that about one-fifth of the reported cases through the virus will be seriously ill, so in case of doubt must be treated intensive care. to report \nAccording to the first death victims, it was patients who had some severe pre-existence. Even with other infectious diseases, people with pre-existing diseases are particularly endangered - for example at the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so change their genome. This can cause you to become more dangerous for people in the course of an outbreak - but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) expects no similar mortality to the current time as the outbreak of SARS. Time Online: Suppose someone suspects an infection with the coronavirus, but does not call in the family doctor before, but comes directly into practice. Is this a risk for other patients who are already in the waiting room? Leson: There is a risk of risk in the waiting room of a family doctoral practice. Because patients can sit, which can be infectious, where you can get infected. This applies to this virus exactly as for any other. Again, it is about to ask yourself: how big I guess as a patient's danger - this can not know a doctor or a consultation hours. So: If I know, I was in China and come back with these symptoms, then I should describe this at the reception. But yes, you can basically be infected with a disease that has a patient, may infect in practice. Time Online: In pediatrician practices you sometimes see separate waiting rooms for children who have windpox or measles, for example. Is this also available in family doctor practices? Leson: It's true, in pediatrician practices there are sometimes separate waiting rooms for babies and for older, infectious children, even in hospitals there is that. But in family doctor practices it is not common to have a special infectious room. Time online: How concrete people protect themselves working in a doctor's practice, not to contact a patient? Leson: In a reasoned suspicion, the first protective measure is always a protective clothing - ie mouthguard and gloves - to protect yourself from the air before transferring through the air. Time online: If I go to the doctor or hospital with the initial symptoms - it can happen that I am quarantined? Leson: Also there is: only for really justified suspicion. Then it can actually happen that the doctor has it directly into the hospital. In such a case, for example, it is no longer meaningful to drive through the bus to the nearest hospital - there would be risking other passengers on the way. Time online: How can I find if I have infected myself with the current coronavirus? Leson: If a family practitioner has a reasoned suspicion, the patient should be admitted to a clinic. There is then examined in the laboratory whether the pathogen can be detected. Time online: Must one \nInfection with the coronavirus at the health department are reported? Leson: Clinics must report justified suspected cases of the respective health authority. What this then has for consequences depends on the health department: It may be, for example, as in the case in Bavaria that the Office tries to determine possible contact persons that could have infected. Time online: Some people continue to work with typical colds symptoms. Coronavirus or not - when should you leave that better? Leson: If you feel really sick. Fever, breathing difficulty - then you should not haul to work anymore. But that also hangs together with individual health, there is no absolute right or wrong. You have to reinhorchen and say: If I have 39 fever now, I'll stay better at home. TIME ONLINE: Should I shake up right now? Leson: Of course, pathogens can be transferred when shaking hands. This is not just now, but at any time. Also with this question, basically, the principles of justified suspicion as well as their own wellbeing apply. In addition, anyone can minimize the risks of infection - for example by thorough hand washing. Time online: And should one go to the doctor in view of the new coronavirus at the moment, if you have such symptoms? Leson: You just have to make clear the risk concepts: is there really a reasoned suspicion that I wear this virus in me? But now generally to say: While the coronavirus is up to date, I should go to the doctor earlier or rather not come to work - that's not necessary.

announcement. \"when they raise taxes on us, they don't consult us,\" trump said. \"i think that's probably one in the same.\" the vast majority of new cases of the covid-19 illness are now linked to europe. deaths in italy topped 1,000, with more than 15,000 testing positive. the virus, first detected in december in china, has produced crippling outbreaks in asia, europe and the middle east, ignited financial panic and in the last week has seen dizzying developments erupt by the hour. european soccer leagues, american basketball, hockey and baseball games, school terms for hundreds of millions of students, weddings, baptisms, funerals, nightlife, culture high and low all fell by the wayside with a swiftness and scope that was becoming increasingly difficult to grasp. amid the fear, it can be easy to forget that more than half those infected with the virus have recovered from covid-19, the disease it causes. most patients have only mild or moderate symptoms such as a fever or cold, though severe symptoms including pneumonia can occur, especially in older adults and people with existing health problems. canadian prime minister justin trudeau began isolating himself at home because his wife showed flu-like symptoms after her return from britain. in spain, a leading member of a far-right party tested positive for the virus. in the united states, several politicians were quarantining themselves as a protective measure. meanwhile, the brazilian president's communications director tested positive just days after meeting with trump at his mar-a-lago resort. despite that, trump has no immediate plans to be tested or go into self-quarantine, the white house said. \"both the president and vice president had almost no interactions with the individual who tested positive

china's ongoing lockdown of the original epicenter of the illness, to the shuttering of the los angeles zoo, to belgium ordering schools, cafes, restaurants and night clubs to close. in italy's lombardy region, the virus's european epicenter, hospitals were overwhelmed with both the sick and the dead. the nation with the second-oldest population in the world has seen its fatality rate reach more than 6%, far higher than other countries. across italy, restaurants, cafes and retail shops closed after the prime minister imposed a lockdown on personal movement. grocery stores, pharmacies and outdoor markets were allowed to operate.  in the u.s., even a federal reserve pledge to inject up to $2 trillion into short-term lending markets did not halt the bleeding on wall street. the s&p 500

there\u2019s the door handle: use one\u2019s elbow or fish out a piece of tissue paper to touch it? or perhaps wait two seconds and someone will hopefully open the door from the inside?   once seated, i notice the cutlery placed on the table, resting on but a flimsy barrier of paper napkin beneath. i wonder how long it\u2019s been sitting there, and if it has picked up possible pathogens on the tabletop left by the previous customer. is it terrible to ask for a fresh set? \u201ci get inexplicably happy when i see forks, spoons and chopsticks individually wrapped in plastic these days,\u201d says a colleague whose most pressing concern at the moment is not waging a war against single-use plastic. after a lengthy scrub at the toilet sink, i return and panic a little when the waiter hands me a greasy menu. damn, should\u2019ve washed my hands after ordering. i eye the raw items on the menu: sashimi, salad, and wonder if getting some is akin to dicing with death.   and then, the server fills my water glass. to my dismay, he picks it up by the rim \u2014 where my lips would soon touch. should i throw caution to the winds and drink it anyway? my equally fastidious friend laments,

(according to the who, global fatality rate for sars patients was at 11 per cent)   q: is the wuhan coronavirus going to mutate further?   prof gray: we don\u2019t know, but the good news is that so far the 2019-ncov virus is not changing.   prof wang: all viruses mutate in nature. but so far, the wuhan coronavirus seems to be quite stable.   q: will tropical weather affect the spread of the virus? if yes, how?   prof gray: ultraviolet light can often kill respiratory viruses.   prof wang: no scientific evidence for that yet.   q: how do you think this coronavirus outbreak will end?   prof neuman: as a person who likes to make anti-viral drugs, things that actually slow down the virus, i can say that (better weather patterns or health measures) are probably not going to be the end (of the virus outbreak). and a vaccine will probably not going to be the end.   it\u2019s old-fashioned stuff like quarantines - basically keeping infected people away from healthy people that actually beat viruses like this. the risk is there are only so many quarantine facilities available in mainland china and only so many facilities to keep people properly treated while they are being treated for the virus. so if there are too many people that turn up sick, and overwhelm the systems that are there, that is potentially a risk.      we\u2019ve seen china build new hospitals very quickly... so i believe they realise this possible risk and are trying to combat it - which is actually very good news.   q: can you predict how long the virus will last?   prof gray: i don\u2019t expect to see a quick resolution. we are seeing the epidemic expand into other \ncountries now.   prof wang: no expert can do such a prediction as this is a highly complex matter. even the experts at who are monitoring and assessing daily.however, the next two weeks will be critical when the chinese new year holiday ends in china. if we see a decrease in two to three weeks, i am hopeful we can control this.   asst prof anderson:\u00a0it is difficult to predict when the peak of infection will occur. if the quarantine measures are effective and patients can be isolated for 14 days, the outbreak should end.   download our\u00a0app\u00a0or subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the wuhan virus outbreak:\u00a0https://cna.asia/telegram ", "label": 0}, {"content": "Starbucks temporarily stops the work of coffee shops in Hubei Province due to the pneumonia epidemic.

done,\u201d he said, referring to the singapore authorities\u2019 risk assessment alert level which now\u00a0stands at orange.   speaking in a recorded message on thursday (march 12), mr lee said that the government is planning ahead for more stringent measures which will be tried out in preparation for actual implementation when necessary.   these include temporary \u201cadditional social distancing measures\u201d such as suspending school, staggering work hours, or compulsory telecommuting.   \u201cthey will be extra \u2018brakes\u2019, to be implemented when we see a spike in cases. the extra brakes will slow down transmission of the virus, prevent our healthcare system from being overwhelmed, and help bring the numbers back down,\u201d he said. \u201cafter the situation improves, we can ease off and go back to the baseline precautions.\u201d      mr lee was giving an update on the covid-19 outbreak in singapore, following the world health organization\u2019s declaration of a pandemic.\u00a0   this was the second update by mr lee on the coronavirus situation.   the first was a recorded message which was televised on feb 8, a day after singapore raised its disease outbreak response system condition (dorscon) alert level to orange.   in the earlier message, mr lee said, among other things, that if the number of cases keeps growing and the fatality rate remains low as it does for\u00a0influenza, singapore will have to reconsider its strategy at some point to allow hospitals to focus on the most vulnerable patients.\u00a0   on thursday, mr lee noted that \u201cmuch has happened since\u201d his first update five weeks ago. \u201cso it is timely to update you again and share with you what we can expect down the road,\u201d he said.   on the medical front, the authorities continue to see new cases here.   \u201cmost either have travelled overseas, or can be traced to imported cases. each time we have been able to isolate them, do contact tracing, and quarantine the close contacts,\u201d mr lee said. \u201cso our numbers have not blown up. but neither have we been able to eradicate the virus, despite our best efforts.\u201d   at the same time, the number of cases around the world is rising rapidly. mr lee noted that china\u2019s situation is stabilising but new cases are emerging all over the world \u2014 in europe, america\u00a0and the middle east.   \u201cglobally, the number of cases is doubling every five to seven days. hence today, the who declared covid-19 to be a pandemic,\u201d mr lee said.   he said\u00a0that who\u2019s assessment was that many countries will see full-blown outbreaks, with sustained community transmission, \n\u201clike what has happened in south korea and italy\u201d.   \u201cand unlike sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome), this outbreak will continue for some time \u2014 a year, and maybe longer,\u201d mr lee said.   he pointed out that who has highlighted the\u00a0\u201calarming levels of inaction\u201d by many countries as a key reason for the rapid spread of covid-19.   \u201chere in singapore, we have all along taken covid-19 with the utmost seriousness. in fact, who praised our efforts and held singapore up as an example to emulate,\u201d mr lee said.   at the same time, singapore\u00a0faces a serious situation as well, he reiterated.   \u201cwe expect more imported cases, and therefore new clusters and new waves of infection, this time coming from many countries rather than one or two,\u201d he said.   \u201cwe have already imposed some travel restrictions, for example, for china, iran, south korea, italy. we will have to tighten up further temporarily, though we cannot completely shut ourselves off from the world.\u201d   what else singapore\u00a0needs to do   on what else singapore needs to do, mr lee said that since covid-19 \u201cwill be with us for a long time, there are baseline things that we must get used to\u201d.   these include \u201cpractising good personal hygiene, adopting new social norms and discouraging large gatherings, and generally, maintaining some physical distance from one another\u201d.   the authorities have already scaled down community activities, especially for the seniors.   he added: \u201cwe can do more in other areas. for example, at religious gatherings. in south korea, the cases spread through the shincheonji church group. in singapore, two of our big clusters happened in church groups. and several singaporeans who attended a big international religious gathering, a tabligh gathering, in kuala lumpur recently have caught the virus.   \u201cthe issue is, of course, not religion itself, but that the virus can spread quickly to many people in crowded settings, like religious gatherings and services. that is why saudi arabia temporarily stopped umrah pilgrimages; and the pope livestreamed his sermons to avoid crowds on saint peter\u2019s square (in vatican city). i hope singaporeans understand that during this period, we may need to shorten religious services\u00a0or reduce our attendance at such gatherings.\u201d   mr lee also said\u00a0that singapore needs to plan for a possible spike in covid-19 cases.   \u201cwith very large numbers, if it happens, we will not be able to hospitalise and isolate every case like we do now.\u201d   given that 80 per cent of patients\u00a0experience just mild symptoms, those who are most at risk are the elderly\u00a0and those with pre-existing conditions such as high blood pressure or lung problems, he said.   \u201cso with larger numbers, the sensible thing will be to hospitalise only the more serious cases, and encourage those with mild symptoms to see their family general practitioner and rest at home \u2013 isolate themselves,\u201d he added.   \u201cthis way, we focus resources on the seriously ill, speed up our response time\u00a0and, \nhopefully, minimise the number of fatalities.\u201d   in the meantime, the government is freeing up intensive care units and hospital beds and facilities, to create a larger\u00a0capacity to meet any surge in infections.   \u201cbut rest assured, any singaporean who needs urgent medical care, whether for covid-19 or other illnesses, will be taken care of,\u201d mr lee said.   turning to the economy, mr lee said that this was a major concern for the government.   \u201cour economy is taking a big hit. that is why we did the s$4 billion support and stabilisation package in the budget last month to help businesses, workers and households tide over the immediate period.\u201d\u00a0   while this has helped, the government knew it may have to do more. so,\u00a0it is working on a second package of measures. \u201cwe will help our companies with their costs and cash flow, to keep them afloat through the storm,\u201d he said.   \u201cwe will help our workers keep their jobs, and retrain during their downtime, so that when things return to normal, our workers will be the first out of the gate\u00a0and immediately productive.   \"and we will give those who are retrenched and unemployed, as well as their families, an extra helping hand to

Given the spread of the novel coronavirus, the United States have announced their citizens from the center of Central China's most affected by the epidemic. For Tuesday, a flight was planned to bring US authorities personnel and other citizens from the met city of Wuhan to San Francisco, the US State Department announced. For private individuals, there are only \"limited capacities\", the authority restricted. People are given priority, which are particularly endangered by the coronavirus, it was said. France also plans to bring his own citizens with buses from the province of Hubei. In the elf million metropolis Wuhan, the new pathogens appeared for the first time in December 2019. As a place of origin, a fish and wildlife market is so far suspected in the city. There, the virus could have jumped over to people for the first time. According to authorities, there are now more than 2,000 confirmed infection cases in China, 56 patients died on the consequences of the diseases that the virus can trigger. The vast majority of death already had other pre-existence as they infected themselves with the virus. Also in China's financial metropolis Shanghai there was a first death through the new coronavirus. The dead should act for an 88-year-old man who already suffered from other health problems, the authorities of the city announced. So far, a total of 40 cases of respiratory disease were confirmed in the metropolitan city. Meanwhile, the virus also spreads out of China: On Saturday, Canada reported a first alleged case of the disease in Toronto. The possibly infected man had remembered Wuhan only a few days ago, said the head of the Health Authority of Toronto. China has asked the city and more than a dozen other cities since Thursday de facto quarantined by exposing public transport. In Hong Kong, the two largest amusement parks, Disneyland and Ocean Park, set their operation for the time being due to the virus. In the upcoming holiday week to the Chinese New Year, the parks had actually expected a visitor tower. According to current findings of virologists and epidemics, each with the virus, everybody infected between two to three more people. Whether the contagion rate will remain so depends on the effectiveness of countermeasures, scientists said the Imperial College in London and the University of Lancaster. In order to curb the disease, at least 60 percent of new recesses would have to be prevented in the future. At the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities of the World Health Organization WHO reported an accumulation of pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause in the Central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified \nNovel virus as the cause of the diseases. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days then a group released a group of the virologen Christian's premier from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 the first diagnostic test for the new virus, the researcher provisionally call 2019-NCOV. With the test, the virus can be detected in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, on which, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected. Both the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as well as Mers (MIDDLE East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses which have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more than 750 died. With the MERS virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronaviruses. Many of them relate to respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example. In China, several thousand persons are suffering from them, some of them - most of them with pre-existing conditions - have died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first infection cases outside of China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been in Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection with a tourist, who came back from Wuhan, on January 24, the first cases were known in France. Meanwhile, first cases were confirmed in Germany. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. The virus can cause pneumonia that can endally end. Since it is a viral illness, antibiotics do not help. Meanwhile, it is clear that the virus can be transferred from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transfers after a dozen cases were known in medical staff. Medizors assume that the virus is transmitted above all over droplet infection. The World Health Organization calculates, as announced on January 24, at the moment that an infected one cuts 1.4 to 2.5 other people. Contest these numbers, the virus is less contagious than SARS and also the viral flu. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals. That can not be said yet. The World Health Organization said on 28 January that about one-fifth of the reported cases through the virus will be seriously ill, so in case of doubt must be treated intensive care. to report \nAccording to the first death victims, it was patients who had some severe pre-existence. Even with other infectious diseases, people with pre-existing diseases are particularly endangered - for example at the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so change their genome. This can cause you to become more dangerous for people in the course of an outbreak - but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) expects no similar mortality to the current time as the outbreak of SARS.

cases.   with the coronavirus already detected in more than 90 countries and caseloads climbing more quickly abroad than within china, governments are scrambling to find the best methods to keep the contagion at bay.   but how much can other countries borrow from china's coronavirus playbook, given the toll the limits take on personal freedom and economic activity?   so far, china is the only country that has dealt with a large scale outbreak and brought surging case numbers under control, at least for now.   \"china's bold approach to contain the rapid spread of this new respiratory pathogen has changed the course of a rapidly escalating and deadly epidemic,\" the who wrote in a report on its joint mission to china last month. \"these are the only measures that are currently proven to interrupt or minimise transmission chains in humans.\"   but the who has also stressed that there is no one-size-fits-all approach.   health specialists said that some parts of china's model, involving the lockdown, or \"cordon sanitaire\", of epicentres and what who calls \"extreme social distancing\" measures could be applied elsewhere.   \"in wuhan, the cordon sanitaire slowed the process, and [infections] did not emerge at the same strong pace around the country, so it was possible to bring support\u00a0\u2014 sending doctors and supplies from other parts of the country - to the city, which had to face a huge outbreak, while there were much better conditions in other cities,\" said mr antoine flahault, director of the institute of global health at the university of geneva.   \"it is an experience that we can now learn from on a very large scale.\"   a version of this model has already been applied in italy, where a large portion of the country's northern region, including milan and venice, went into lockdown on sunday. the restrictions affect some 16 million people, or about a quarter of the population, in a country that has more than 7,300 confirmed cases of covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.   italian prime minister giuseppe conte said there would be some exceptions for travel for \"work-related reasons, emergencies or health reasons\". the move marked an expansion of an earlier, smaller-scale lockdown of 11 northern italian cities at the centre of the national outbreak.   two other hard-hit \ncountries\u00a0\u2014 iran and south korea\u00a0\u2014 have not implemented such stringent measures, despite having numerous cases of local transmission of the disease.   the south korean government has declared three \"special care zones\" around the outbreak epicentres, promising more resources and warning people from travelling there. the country has relied largely on a rigorous testing programme to control the spread, with more than 7,300 cases in total.   in iran, the government has imposed some restrictions on travel between major cities, closed schools and called on iranians to avoid public places, according to media reports.   mr adam kamradt-scott, an associate professor at the university of sydney who specialises in global health security, said governments should be trying to stop transmission, but \"it's important to make sure that the measures are proportionate to the nature of the outbreak\".   \"it's a spectrum\u00a0\u2014 you can implement very severe measures and stop transmission fairly rapidly, but that might also cause significant economic damage,\" mr kamradt-scott said.   \"governments could follow china's example quite closely, but the main concern that has arisen around china's responses has been with regards to the implications for human rights, and there's quite a difference in how countries approach these issues.   \"some countries like the united states and canada have a bill of rights which afford their citizens certain guarantees.\"   some countries have taken more limited steps such as banning big gatherings, cancelling school classes, and adding international travel restrictions.   but working out what to do next will depend on economic and governance considerations, as well as how big a burden each health system can handle, according to ms hannah clapham, an assistant professor at the national university of singapore's saw swee hock school of public health.   \"the big phrase being used there is 'flattening the curve'. that's the point where different countries will be thinking 'what can we handle and how do we put in place different interventions to make sure that things maintain below the level that we can handle'\u00a0\u2014 mainly that's about icu beds,\" ms clapham said.   different measures for social distancing, including working from home, changing the hours of public transport, and cancelling large gatherings can help to adjust this peak, whereas a lockdown may only work when there is a clear epicentre.   mr flahault said these kinds of measures could buy countries time as they prepared for cases around the country.   \"it's better to have a longer period with hundreds of people coming to your hospitals rather than a shorter period with thousands because of the quality of the health care, which can be absorbed. this wave cannot be maintained if the wave is a tsunami,\" he said.   if a mass lockdown is enforced, the burden falls heaviest on those behind the containment walls, bringing its own problems, according to mr yanzhong huang, senior fellow for global \nhealth at the us-based council on foreign relations.   \"[with] the lockdown of wuhan, many of those infected patients were unable to get timely treatment, unable to be hospitalised, and that contributed to the rapid spread of the virus, probably, in the city and in hubei province,\" he said, noting it could also have led to a higher mortality rate.   \"much of the chinese experience is not replicable in other countries, given the size and the totalist state's ability to mobilise the bureaucracy, mobilise the society to tackle a common challenge.   \"you have all those legal and logistical challenges in a democracy like the united states, even if you want to lock down the city.\"   other densely populated cities such as hong kong and singapore offer alternatives. both places reported cases early in the epidemic and had community transmission of the disease, but both have kept their case numbers low so far through proactive testing, travel restrictions, home quarantine, and rigorous contact tracking of confirmed cases.   for countries that only have a small number of infections, or only imported cases, finding ways to stay ahead of the virus is vital.   that's the situation in lebanon, which, like many countries has just a few cases, but also operates with a health system that could be overburdened by a sharp outbreak. twenty-two cases have been found, so far, including at least two who entered the country and were moving around freely, despite lebanon's airport screenings, travel restrictions, and home quarantine for those from high-risk countries, according to mr hassan zaraket, assistant director at the centre for infectious diseases research at the american university of beirut.   \"now we have a window of one to two weeks to know [from] these two cases how many people might develop symptoms, as we have more of these cases the problem would become more challenging,\" he said.   mr zaraket said those concerns were compounded by ongoing protests and a financial crisis, with capital controls that make importing medical supplies challenging.   \"if anyone loses their grip, if people start becoming less compliant or the government stops [case detection] measures, then i would think there's a likelihood for a sustained community spread,\" he said.   \"i hope we don't have to deal with a large-scale pandemic.\"

At the end of 2019, a coronavirus was able to pass the barrier of the species, came to humans and is scaring the world. As it is a new virus that infects humans, there is still much to know about it. The scientific community and public health authorities have gathered efforts to know them with detail and as soon as possible. What do we ever know about this epidemic with epicenter in the city of Wuhan in the center of China? Are there cases in Portugal of infection by new coronavirus? Yes, the first two cases of Portuguese were confirmed with Covid-19 this Monday (March 2). The first case was one of a 60-year-old doctor who was on vacation in northern Italy. He is hospitalized at the Hospital of Santo Ant\u00f3nio, in Porto, and felt the first symptoms on 29 February. The second confirmed case was that of a commercial of the civil construction with 33 years that returned from Valencia in Spain. He is hospitalized at the Hospital of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o, Porto, and felt the first symptoms on February 26. This Tuesday, the Directorate-General for Health (DGS) confirmed two more cases: that of a 60-year-old man who has a call to another case already confirmed in Portugal and is at the University Center of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o, Porto; And that of a 37-year-old man who also has a call to another case and is at Hospital Curry Cabral in Lisbon. What is the name of the virus and the disease? The official name of the virus is coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2), since they have similarities at genetic level with SARS-COV at about 80%. This designation was attributed by the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy and published this week in an article in the free biorxiv access repository. Until then, it was temporarily designated \"2019-Ncov\". The name chosen for the disease that the virus causes was \"Covid-19\", which emerged from the English acronym of the expression \"disease by Coronavirus 2019\" (Coronavirus Disease 2019). The decision was taken by the World Health Organization (WHO) in collaboration with the World Animal Health Organization and the United Nations for Food and Agriculture. Both the virus name and the disease were chosen so that there are no references to specific geographic locations, groups of people or animals, to avoid stigmatizations. Is it already known the origin of the new coronavirus and how has it passed to humans? No, there are only suspicions. In a recent report, WHO indicated that there are increasingly evidence that there is a link between SARS-COV-2 and other coronaviruses found in bats, especially those of genus Rhinolophus subspecies, which are abundant in Asia, Middle East, Africa and in Europe. The transmission circuit is also unknown and \"the most likely hypothesis is that an intermediate host animal has had a role in transmission.\" Last week, a team of China scientists concluded that Pangolim is a host potential \nintermediate of the virus. The discovery of coronavirus origin may help understand how the start of the outbreak happened in the city of Wuhan and thus avoid future outbreaks of coronavirus. There are several teams - including one from WHO that is in China - trying to respond to this and other issues. What symptoms that cause dry cough, fever, fatigue and respiratory difficulties. Most people have symptoms similar to the flu and a small proportion of patients will develop pneumonia. In the most serious cases of pneumonia, organs can occur and Covid-19 becomes fatal. How do you transmit? Through direct contact with infected people. This can happen through respiratory droplets when a person infected cough or sneezes, saliva droplets or nose secretions. Therefore, WHO recommends that you have a \"good practice of respiratory hygiene\", such as sneezing for the elbow. It is also important that people lay their hands regularly when they are in contact with people with the symptoms of Cuvid-19. Although the origin could have been an animal, there is no proof that indicates a domestic animal can convey this coronavirus. Even so, WHO states that foods should be cooked carefully to avoid cross-contamination or pay attention to living animals or live animal area surfaces. About whether it is safe to receive an order from China, one of the most frequent questions, the WHO responds without doubt: \"It is safe. People are not at risk of contracting the new coronavirus if they are ordered. From the experience we have of other coronaviruses, this type of virus does not survive much time on the objects, such as letters and packages. \" Asymptomatic people can even convey this coronavirus? Yes, it may be possible that people infected with the virus can be infectious before showing significant symptoms, refers to WHO, which quotes recent reports. Even so, according to the available data, people who have symptoms are causing most cases. It takes more clinical information to determine what really is the infectious period. And what is the incubation period? For now, it is estimated that it can go from one to 12.5 days and that the average is between five to six days. WHO states that these estimates should also be improved, but on the basis of the information of other coronavirus diseases, the incubation period should be 14 days. In February, a team of China scientists announced that the average of the incubation period would be only three days and that this period could extend up to 24 days. These preliminary results were briefly reported in the Medrxiv Health Sciences Research Portal. At a press conference, the General Directorate of Portuguese Health, Grace Freitas, has not valued the study, saying that it is information \"that is not validated,\" \"one of the many studies that circulate\" and that WHO does not mention it. as a dangerous \nCan this virus be? Based on the data available, the mortality rate is about 3%. However, this number may be overestimated because it only takes into account the confirmed cases and there may be even more infected people, according to information provided by the British Organization Science Media Center. Have we achieved the peak of the epidemic? We still do not know. On 12 February, WHO announced that the number of new cases of coronavirus had stabilized the previous week. However, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, precavated that it was taken care of the interpretations made from there: \"This outbreak can still go in any direction.\" The next day, more than 13,000 new cases were recorded in a single day in the Hubei region, where Wuhan is. WHO points out that this has happened due to a change in how cases are diagnosed. \"We have seen a significant peak in the number of cases reported in China, but there is no significant change in the trajectory of Covid-19 outbreak,\" said Mike Ryan, director of the WHO emergency program at a press conference at the end of this week. He also highlighted that covid-19 cases are not increasing dramatically outside China. The exception was on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which confirmed another 44 cases. In all, this quarantined ship in Japan already had more than 200 confirmed cases. In an interview with Reuters Agency, the Epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan (China's National Health Commission investigator) was optimistic and said that the peak of the outbreak could be reaching in the middle or late this month and finished in April. But it's still early for prognostics. Who can be more vulnerable to the virus? It still has to realize better as this coronavirus affects people, but the elderly and people with pre-existing diseases appear to have a greater risk of developing Covid-19 with gravity. How many infected people have recovered worldwide? According to data from the real-time WorldMeter statistics site, of 80,026 confirmed cases in mainland China, 44,462 (56%) were able to recover from the disease. According to Johns Hopkins University (USA), the recovery rate in China exceeds the 50% barrier. How long does the virus survive on surfaces? It is not yet known well, but WHO states that preliminary information suggests that it can survive \"few hours or more\". Simple disinfectants can be enough for the virus not to last long enough to infect people. Is there any specific treatment? No, there is still no medication or specific treatment recommended to avoid or treat Covid-19. Infected people receive health care to alleviate or treat symptoms. In the most serious cases, they receive the organs support therapy. As it is a virus, WHO warns that antibiotics do not kill him. about 300 experts meeting in Geneva (in Switzerland) in February, at a meeting \nOrganized by WHO, established different priorities: the treatment of people who are already infected with Covid-19; find easy ways to do tests; and realize the behavior of the virus. There were also details on the treatments for the virus. quoted by the magazine New Scientist, the WHO reported that the results of clinical trials to know if medications for HIV (Lopinavir and ritonavir) are effective in treating the symptoms of Cuvid-19 \"will be known in a few days or weeks.\" Clinical trials for Remdesivir (which was initially development for Ebola virus) are ready in \"a few weeks\". At this time, four vaccines against Covid-19 are also being developed. WHO estimated that three or four months have begun trials in people for one or two of these vaccines and that one is available for general use in 18 months. What are the recommendations for people to protect? It is the basic recommendations used to reduce any risk of acute respiratory infection and are mainly for travelers, such as: avoid close contact with people with these infections; Frequently wash your hands, especially after being in direct contact with sick people; avoid unprotected contact with wild animals or for human consumption; or adopt respiratory label measures. If you have been in an area where you existed or there is a transmission of Cuvid-19, you must follow the recommendations of WHO and national and local health authorities. If you have not been in an area where Covid-19 is nor has infected people, your risk of infection is low, refers to WHO in a recent report. \"It is understandable that you can feel anxious about this epidemic. But check the facts in credible sources to help you rigorously determine risks and can adopt reasonable precautions, \"it still recommends WHO. The Directorate-General for Health has created a site dedicated to the new coronavirus. Subscribe newsletters for free and receive the best of the publicity and the deepest jobs of the public. If you have symptoms, what should you do? In general, the Directorate-General for Health recommends that people who come from an affected area where they may have contact with patients to take active surveillance and contact the SNS 24 (808 24 24 24) in order to have advice on the which should do. \"It will work on a case-by-case basis. and counseling may be defined other measures, \"said Grace Freitas, Director General of Health, in a press conference. What Portuguese hospitals can receive infected patients? In the north of the country, they are able to receive patients with the new coronavirus the hospitals of St. John and Santo Ant\u00f3nio, both in Porto, as well as the Hospital of Braga, the local health unit (ULS) of Matosinhos and the Hospital T\u00e2mega Center And Sousa. In the center, the response is reinforced at ULs of Guard and the Pediatric Hospital of Coimbra. at \nRegion of Lisbon and Tagus Valley are the University Center of Lisbon North (Santa Maria Hospital and Pulido Valente and Hospital University Center for West Lisbon (Egas Moniz Hospital and San Francisco Xavier Hospital). In the Alentejo, it is ready to intern patients with the new coronavirus to Uls Alentejo coastline. In the Algarve, the answer is ensured through the Algarve University Hospital Center. Are we having a pandemic? No. WHO considers that coronavirus is not yet a pandemic - term used to describe situations in which an infectious disease threatens many people simultaneously and around the world. \"We are at an epidemic phase with multiple outbreaks,\" said Sylvie Briand, director of the global preparation department for the WHO infectious risks. At the moment, there are more than 90,000 people infected with SARS-COV-2 and died of more than three thousand people around the world, according to the data from the European Demos Control Center (ECDC). Italy is the country in Europe with more registered cases, overcoming the 1600. One of the major fears of WHO is that the epidemic reaches African countries with weak health care such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, as has highlighted Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

infections in the country to six. and since then, focus has increasingly shifted to the fallout impact of the new covid-19 cases and to the question of how ready the country is to fight the global outbreak. covid-19 first originated in the chinese city of wuhan. the disease, that leads to illnesses ranging from common cold, fever, shortness of breath to pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death, is caused by a kind of coronavirus never seen before. this led to the virus initially being called novel coronavirus 2019 (ncov-19). the disease was later formally labelled coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). in the media, it's being widely called coronavirus. as of tuesday, coronavirus has infected more than 89,000 people in over 60 countries. the virus has killed more than 3,000 people in around 8 countries. most of these cases (80,151 infected and 2,943 dead) are from mainland china, the epicentre of the covid-19 outbreak, according to figures compiled by news agency reuters. india has largely escaped the brunt of the outbreak so far. but the three fresh cases reported this week have brought the spotlight on how prepared the country is to deal with the coronavirus outbreak and how the situation stands currently. here, we recap everything that's happened in india vis-\u00e0-vis the coronavirus outbreak. remember, this information is as of march 3. so far, india has reported six positive cases of coronavirus, or covid-19. of these, three were from kerala and one each from delhi, hyderabad and jaipur. the kerala cases were reported in february, while the delhi, hyderabad and jaipur infections were confirmed this week. the initial three coronavirus cases in kerala were comparatively localised compared to what has happened this week. the three new cases have had secondary consequences as authorities rushed to contain any possible spread of the new virus. noida schools shut the private institution also said it was taking preventive steps such as fumigation of the campus and school buses. separately, another noida-based school said it would remain shut for the next few days so that it could sanitise its campus as a precautionary step. air india warns fliers air india has essentially asked passengers of the flight to come forward and get themselves screened for symptoms of coronavirus. meanwhile, the

any symptoms of covid-19. separately, low-cost carrier indigo, which flew the \nbengaluru techie on a dubai-bengaluru flight, has placed four crew members from the flight under home observation.

had contact with have been identified and that both the telangana and karnataka governments are taking care of the people at risk. agra on alert agra in uttar pradesh is also on alert after links emerged with both the delhi coronavirus patient and the italian tourist who tested positive for covid-19 in jaipur. the statement added that the six people had come in contact with the delhi coronavirus patient. news agency pti, quoting sources, reported that the 45-year-old man had come to agra to visit his family and that this is how he came in contact with the six people. with fresh cases being reported in india, the government has gone on war-footing to combat the global threat. among the new measures taken include: india's first brush with the coronavirus outbreak was a mammoth operation undertaken by the government to rescue and evacuate indian citizens stuck in china's wuhan and on a cruise ship anchored off japan's coast. simultaneously, an indian air force transport aircraft, which flew to wuhan with emergency medical supplies, rescued another set of indians from the virus-hit city on its return journey. all the evacuees from china and japan underwent 14-day quarantines back home. most of them have been released after testing negative for covid-19. so, in short: there have been six confirmed cases of coronavirus in india. three of these -- all from kerala -- later tested negative and the patients were discharged after treatment. the three new patients -- reported in delhi, hyderabad and jaipur this week -- are under isolation at different hospitals and the government is working on tracking people the patients came in contact with. globally, coronavirus has infected more than 89,000 people in over 60 countries and has killed more than 3,000 people in

the first here - announced on tuesday. the last case is an imported one involving a chinese tourist from china's wuhan city.   the cluster of local transmissions is linked to a group of 20 tourists from guangxi, china, that visited health products shop yong thai hang in cavan road in lavender. with the cases announced on wednesday, the number of cases linked to the tour group is now seven.   the moh said the chinese health authorities have confirmed that two travellers from the tour group have the coronavirus infection.   the ministry said on thursday that the infected six-month-old baby, a singaporean, was cared for at home and was not in any infant care facility before he was admitted to hospital.   the baby\u2019s father, a 45-year-old singaporean, developed symptoms last saturday. he visited a gp clinic the next day and was later isolated at the ncid on tuesday.   before he was admitted, he was at his home in jalan bukit merah and worked as a private-hire driver.   he visited tiong bahru plaza, tiong bahru market and beo crescent market and food centre.   the moh said the risk of infection from transient contact, such as on public transport or in public places, is assessed to be low.   the man\u2019s wife works at the yong thai hang shop, which caters to chinese tour groups.   the 28-year-old woman is a singapore permanent resident who did not recently travel to china. on tuesday, the moh confirmed that she and the family\u2019s foreign domestic helper, a 44-year-old indonesian woman, were infected with the \ncoronavirus.   this was after yong thai hang was visited by the tour group from guangxi on jan 23. the singaporean tour guide of the group was later confirmed to be infected.   the coronavirus, known as 2019-ncov, first emerged in wuhan in december last year and has so far proven to be more infectious than the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars).   as of thursday, the outbreak has infected more than 28,000 people and killed more than 560, with hong kong reporting its first death from the coronavirus on tuesday, the second fatality outside mainland china.   the deceased was a 39-year-old man with an underlying illness. he had taken the high-speed train from hong kong to wuhan city in hubei province, and from changsha in hunan province to hong kong last month.   most of the deaths from the virus occurred in central hubei province.   in the wake of the outbreak, a growing number of countries, including italy, the united states, australia, singapore, japan and russia, have put in place travel restrictions. germany, france and the us have evacuated citizens from china.   several major airlines have also halted flights to and from china, deepening concerns of a widespread economic slowdown.   in singapore, measures to combat the outbreak include mask distribution at residents' committee centres and community centres islandwide, which began last saturday.   the government announced on jan 30 that all 1.3 million households in singapore would be given a pack of four masks each amid reports of shops running out of stock.   on tuesday, the government also said that large gatherings and communal activities, such as assemblies and excursions, will be suspended at schools, pre-schools and eldercare facilities here from wednesday after the first local transmissions of the coronavirus were reported.   the moh said on thursday that\u00a0310\u00a0suspected cases have tested negative for the virus so far. the test results for the remaining 147 cases are pending.   the ministry has identified 435 close contacts of the confirmed cases. of these, 353 are still in singapore, with 348 already contacted and being quarantined or isolated. efforts are being made to contact the remaining five close contacts.   the moh still advised singaporeans to defer all travel to hubei province and all non-essential travel to mainland china.   members of the public should also observe good personal hygiene such as frequently washing their hands with soap.   they should also wear a mask if they have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or shortness of breath, and seek medical attention promptly if they are feeling unwell.   click to listen to st's health check podcast ", "label": 1}, {"content": "Passengers returning from China to Portugal will receive informational leaflets in the airplanes due to coronaviruses.

", "label": 1}, {"content": "The dynamics of a global outbreak. With new infection cases in Germany, the Coronavirus SARS-COV-2 is again closer to the population. Although the risk is still very low in this country. Nevertheless, the reports worried about the new pathogen, which is currently around the world. Not everything is still known about him. The first infections with the new coronavirus was there at the end of last year. Residents of the Central Chinese city of Wuhan came at first with enigmatic lung diseases in the hospital. Soon, millions were affected near Wuhan and overcomed travelers and business people quickly reached the virus the whole world. Meanwhile, several tens of thousand cases are officially confirmed - and the number is slowly approaching the 100,000-brand, researchers assume that we are just before the pandemic. Numbers from the World Health Organization (WHO) and health authorities from China, the US or the European Union, collected by the CSSE of Johns Hopkins University, show how the outbreak has developed. Within the few weeks from the beginning of January to the end of February, the number of officially reported infected issued from a few dozen to more than 80,000. The number of dead has now exceeded 2,700 and continues to rise. The statistics that there are currently on the outbreak of the coronavirus are to be taken with caution. On the one hand, it is because it is a overview in such a large disease location as the in China is particularly difficult for authorities. Experts assume that there are still a large number of dark figures from patients who are infected whose cases have not yet been officially registered. In addition, in the course of the outbreak, there were different views about who should be registered as a corona case. This shows the sudden increase on February 13th. What happened? At least one Chinese health authority has changed its counting way on this day, which in the particularly affected province Hubei. Previously, such cases were registered in which the laboratory tests were positive. However, since these tests had not always reliably pointed out the virus, since then patients have been counted in which the new disease COVID-19 was diagnosed with the symptoms. Although the counting may be different, one thing is determined: the number of corona cases continues to rise. The new virus belongs to the family of coronaviruses, similar to the SARS virus. Again and again, both viruses are compared. And the name after the new virus SARS-COV-2 is a successor to the old virus SARS-COV, which in 2002 and 2003 an epidemic with tens of thousands of infected triggered. But the case numbers clearly show that both outbreaks can hardly be compared with each other. Meiden crowds and stay at home \nNovel coronavirus is transmitted by droplet infection. Also infected, which feel still healthy, are already contagious. Therefore, the distance to other people hold. just more than one meter is enough; No shaking shaking, no hugs to welcome; Middle as much human beings as possible. Who feels bad, should stay home. For his own sake and to protect others. This is true not only for the workplace: who believes he has infected with Corona, should only call in the doctor's office or at the health department, instead of simply squeezing into the full waiting room. Washing regularly and thoroughly hands, that is, at least 20 seconds, with soap and up to the wrist. If you want to use a disinfectant, you should make sure that it is marked as a virucid, so really kill viruses. In addition, unwashed hands should not touch food or eyes and mouth. Anyone who touches surfaces where the pathogen is adhered to, and then focuses on the face, which can be infected. That's why it's wise, such as elevator buttons or door opener to press the ankle or elbow instead of fingers. Whoever is infectious, can protect the general public by disposing of paper handkerchiefs immediately and safely. If you have cough or sneezing, you should not keep your hand in front of your face, but the army. In the case of a coronavirus outbreak, it is crucial to really avoid other avoidable infectious diseases. This is especially true for the seasonal flu. For self-consuming and to not unnecessarily burden the health system, older, pregnant women or people with pre-disease should be vaccinated. You will also advise you to a pneumococcal vaccine. For a few days, always useful. With durable foods, important drugs and everything you need small children. (The Federal Office for Population Protection offers online a \"personal checklist\".) Hamster purchases are not necessary. Paper models are already wet after a short wet and stop a virus attack no longer. Surgical surgical masks covering the nose and mouth protect less the carrier, but above all its surroundings. Certified respiratory protective masks are available in three security categories. They provide protection, but their use is so uncomfortable for the wearer that they are little practical for everyday life. Nobody will want to wear these masks long. The disease triggered by the new coronavirus disseminates much faster than SARS. At the beginning of the millennium, at the same time, according to the WHO, not even 5,000 people infected. The number of dead is significantly higher at the current outbreak, which lies because much more people have infected with the virus. Already two months after the beginning of the current outbreak are already more people at the \nNew illness COVID-19 died as a total of SARS. Nevertheless, the high numbers do not mean that the many thousand affected are difficult to ill. Above all, older patients and patients and chronically ill people suffer from fever, cough, breathlessness and in particularly severe cases on pneumonia, which can also endanger. For far more infected the disease is rather harmless, they feel at most slight sign of a cold and recover quickly. On the one hand, the number of the dead rises continuously, on the other side there is also more and more geneses. Until recently, the outbreak focused mainly on China and some surrounding countries, including especially Japan and South Korea. But now Italy developed into another center of the outbreak, there is now more infected than in Japan. In the north of the country, authorities react by temporarily closing schools and kindergartens, the Carnival in Venice was canceled, as well as games of the first Italian football league. Also for Germany, the risk for more cases has increased. Since the end of January there is around 20 patients with a Covid-19 infection in this country. 14 cases occurred in Bavaria. They belong to a so-called infection cluster, their infections were all traced back to a retracted infected person from China. There are also Corona patients in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia and two more belonging to a group of around 120 people who had been brought to Germany in early February from Wuhan. The remaining returnees from this group had left the quarantine in mid-February. They had previously spent two weeks in a barrack in the Rhineland-Palatinate Germersheim. None of them the virus could be detected. The same applies to another return group, which was accommodated in Berlin-K\u00f6penick until recently in Berlin-K\u00f6penick.

There are at least 24,492 people infected with the new coronavirus in China and 24,505 cases confirmed all over the world. Recovery is, however, possible. On average, a patient needs nine days to fully recover. In Hubei, as there are more cases and less means to treat them, recovery time is higher: 20 days. According to the University data from Johns Hopkins, USA, who has been upgrading the numbers for this virus, 911 people recovered in China after being diagnosed with the new coronavirus. The virus has already killed more in China than the SARS epidemic (severe acute respiratory syndrome) between 2002 and 2003. However, the mortality rate is lower: in the case of new coronavirus is 2.1%, according to with the National Chinese Health Commission. In the province of Hubei, epicenter of the outbreak, the rate is slightly higher: 3.1%. It was in this province that approximately 97% of all deaths were registered.

Two-thirds of the victims were male, according to the last report of the National Chinese Health Commission. There are at least two medicines that, according to in vitro tests, may be a solution for the treatment of new coronavirus: Remdesivir and Coloroquina. The conclusions are from a set of researchers at the Wuhan Virology Institute, published in Cell Research journal (available in English also in Nature magazine). The first medicine, Remdesivir, was developed by Pharmaceutical Gilead Sciences and has not yet seen its use to be approved in any location in the world - so China can be a pioneer in its approval if clinical tests are successful. Already the second, chloroquine, has been used for more than 70 years - was especially relevant in the 1980s for malaria treatment - and can be \"highly efficient\", according to laboratory tests, advocate scientists. \"Chloroquine is a cheap and secure medicine that has been used for more than 70 years and therefore has potential to be clinically applied against 2019-NCOV\", is read in the study. Both medications, tested in vitro, showed \"highly efficient\" in the control of the new coronavirus. \"As these components have been used in human patients, with records of their safety, and have shown to be efficient against various diseases, we suggest that they are tested in humans infected with the new coronavirus,\" is read at the end of the article.

  for several days, the chinese government had reported figures that suggested the spread of the epidemic was slowing, but that changed abruptly thursday.   officials in hubei, the chinese province that is the epicenter of the outbreak, said there had been more than 48,000 cases there, a 44 per cent jump from the day before. they also reported 1,310 deaths, a 23 per cent increase. the trend continued friday, though not as markedly, when hubei officials disclosed another 4,800 cases and 116 more deaths.   previously, cases were counted only if patients tested positive for the new virus. now, the figures appear to include anyone who has a ct scan of the lungs showing a telltale pattern of pneumonia.   in the short run, the new accounting may deepen confusion about the true size of the epidemic. it also complicates efforts to track the growth of the illness over the last several weeks.   \u201cwe need to be careful in interpreting these numbers,\u201d dr michael ryan, the who emergency responses chief, said thursday. the larger number of cases, he said, \u201cdoes not represent a significant change in the trajectory of the outbreak.\u201d   the who then released its own figures, leaving out the diagnoses made without a positive test for the virus \u2014 and indicating that it did not fully understand the change china had made.   \u201cfor consistency, we report here only the number of laboratory-confirmed cases,\u201d the organisation said in a situation report. \u201cwho has formally requested additional information on the clinically diagnosed cases, in particular when these have occurred in the course of the outbreak and whether suspect cases were reclassified as clinically diagnosed cases.\u201d   the who reported almost 47,000 confirmed cases worldwide, fewer than 1 per cent outside mainland china. the chinese figures put the total at more than 61,000 cases.   what was wrong with the old way?   in a word, plenty.   kits to test for the virus are not \nbeing produced quickly enough to keep up with demand, and they take days to produce results. using ct scans means more patients can be checked, with the results available almost immediately.   and the tests for the virus have not been very reliable. many sick people have tested negative, only to test positive later. that appears to be, at least in part, because standard testing involves swabbing nasal passages and the throat, while the virus may be lodged in the lungs.   in the united states, the centers for disease control and prevention shipped hundreds of testing kits to state laboratories \u2014 and days later revealed that some of them were faulty. it is not clear whether china has experienced similar problems in making the tests.   so are the new numbers definitive?   no.   there are several ways cases might still be missed. some people get sick, and die or recover, without ever seeing a doctor. ct scans allow doctors to identify people whose infections have caused pneumonia, which can be fatal, but the scans will not catch people with milder symptoms.   there is another source of confusion about the numbers. it was reported this week that china is no longer counting as confirmed cases people who test positive for the virus yet show no symptoms. but some experts said they were not sure what had actually changed.   the chinese health authorities say they can distinguish, on a ct scan, pneumonia brought on by the coronavirus from some other serious lung epidemics. but it is not clear that they can tell it from pneumonia caused by other illnesses, like seasonal influenza; the accuracy may vary with the skill of the doctor reading the scan.   will we eventually get more accurate figures?   quite possibly.   right now, labs are testing for the virus, itself, and viruses can be hard to detect. what is often easier to identify is the immune system's own response.   when a patient contracts an infection, the body produces antibodies to it \u2014 proteins in the blood that recognise a particular pathogen and trigger an immune system attack on it. labs around the world are working to develop a test for antibodies to the new coronavirus, but none is available yet.   it could be tricky.   there are several strains of coronavirus in humans, including ones that cause common colds, sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and mers (middle east respiratory syndrome). antibodies to the new virus may be hard to distinguish from the antibodies people already have to other coronaviruses.   in any case, it can take days or weeks before a patient tests positive for antibodies to a new infection, so the test may not be useful in diagnosing current illnesses.   so while an effective antibody test may produce a fairly comprehensive picture of an outbreak, that picture will lag a bit behind the reality. the new york times ", "label": 1}, {"content": "Spahn expects more coronavirus spread. Germany relies on a containment of the coronavirus epidemic in the country - and according to the assessment of the Federal Minister of Health, still has to adjust to further increasing case numbers. \"The climax of spread is not yet reached,\" said Jens Spahn (CDU) on Wednesday in the Bundestag. The pathogen SARS-COV-2 has meanwhile been demonstrated in all federal states except in Saxony-Anhalt. Italy is most affected in the EU. From Thursday to until 15 March, the country conclude all schools and universities, announced Minister of Education Lucia Azzolina. So far, the schools were closed, especially in northern Italy, because the virus represents there especially. In the country, almost 3100 people with SARS COV-2 have become infected, as civil protection announced. Until Wednesday, the authorities counted 107 dead. The economic implications are fatal for many people, tourism has completely broken. The Association Confurismo spoke of losses of 7.4 billion euros in the three months of March to May. Cities like Venice and Milan are empty, even the capital of Rome - which has so far little falls - is swept. The architectural biennale in Venice was also postponed. A closure of schools does not consider the President of the German Cultural Minister Conference in Germany. Even a shift of the holiday dates is not an issue, Stefanie Hubig said the \"New Osnabr\u00fccker Zeitung\" (Thursday issue). The AFD parliamentary group, on the other hand, considers a closure of schools in Germany to make sense to prevent further virus spread. The Career Association of Children's and Youth Demands (BVKJ) called on the coffers to temporarily increase the number of cards for workers to six. Parents could then look after their sick children at home and would not have to come to the practices for a disability certificate. The authorities in Germany continued to slow down to slow the spread, Spahn said. \"The security of the population is in doubt, even before economic interests.\" The federal government now wants to obtain in addition to other persons involved protective clothing centrally for medical practices, hospitals and federal agencies, as announced after consultations of the crisis of the government. The export of medical protective equipment such as breathing masks, gloves and protective towards abroad is prohibited at the arrangement of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. In view of the spread of the virus, protective equipment is scarce worldwide. Among other things, the cash media had warned, the basic stock of the practices would not be enough nationwide if the number of suspected cases continues. Furthermore, Spahn put the fixed personnel undershares for certain stations except for further strength. Clinics are thus temporarily deviated from specifications to the minimum occupation with nurses given the CovID 19 cases. and pharmacies should in future \nEasy disinfectant can manufacture directly on site. For this purpose, a derogation with the Federal Environment Ministry had been decided, Spahn said after consultations with his country colleagues on Wednesday in Berlin. The minister also acknowledged difficulties in dealing with the virus. \"In the affected regions, all actors are currently under great pressure,\" he said. \"Of course, not all processes are recorded.\" Spoon continues: \"It takes partly too long, until suspected cases are tested.\" But: \"We analyze the situation ongoing and putting occurring problems as fast as possible.\" In South Hesse, for example A county clinic since the weekend also smears through the car window. \"The drive-in for Corona tests is offered as an alternative to the normal investigation in our MVZ practice (Medical Supply Center),\" said Hospital Speaker Martin Wohlrabe. The possibility is so far well received. Previously several media had reported. For the clinic, the process offers great advantages: suspected cases were \"in their own quarantine station\", managing director Erika Raab declared. The medical specialist taking the smears carry protective clothing. Other clinic staff and patients would not come into contact with the patient. Similar drive-in-test centers also focus more and more cities in South Korea. The number of these facilities has now risen to 48, reported the state broadcaster Arirang. The British National Health Service (NHS) also offers such \"Drive Throughs\" in addition to its own information in the west of London. As a further burden on the health system in Germany, the decision of India could turn out to restrict the export of 26 drugs and drugs. Many imitators come from the country. The basic materials for their production would be from China and because of the epidemic they would not deliver anymore, said the chairman of the Indian Export Promotion Authority for Medicines, Dinesh Dua. India wanted to ensure that important drugs such as paracetamol are available in sufficient quantities for their own market. Germany also relates to the largest customer of Indian generics in the EU from the export restrictions. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) returns its forecast for global economic growth this year because of the virus. Growth will be low in 2020 than in the previous year, IMF-Chefin Kristalina Georgiewa said. How strong the economy will go back, but is currently not foreseeable. In January, the IMF had forecasted an increase of 3.3 percent for 2020. An updated forecast is expected to submit the IMF in the coming month.

Much of cases occurred in North Rhine-Westphalia, \nThe strongly affected district Heinsberg reported 104 infections. Many patients are now healthy again. Heavy Covid-19 gradients are rare, a death returned to it has not yet been recorded in Germany. According to the RKI, more than 93,000 people have proven to be more infected with the new coronavirus worldwide. Israel has imposed new entry requirements from concern for Covid-19 spread.

", "label": 1}, {"content": "WHO: It's still early to say that the new coronavirus is a global emergency. The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it is still too early to say that the new coronavirus originated in China is a global emergency of public health. The decision has just been taken after a second meeting of the WHO Emergency Committee in Geneva in Switzerland. Meanwhile, China is suspended: several Chinese cities are quarantined, which reaches more than 20 million people. Great Chinese Lunar New Year celebration events have been canceled. \"Today [Thursday] I will not declare a global public health emergency. As yesterday [Wednesday], the Emergency Committee was divided, \"said Tedro Adhanom Ghreyesus, WHO Director-General at the Press Conference. The decision was taken after Wednesday the Emergency Committee has not reached a conclusion and having extended the meeting for another day. \"This is an emergency in China, but has not yet become a global health emergency. WHO's risk analysis states that the outbreak is very high in China and has a high risk at regional and global level, \"stressed the Director General. Even so, he emphasized that the fact that he does not declare a global emergency does not mean that WHO does not consider the serious situation or that it is not taking this outbreak seriously. \"WHO is following [the new coronavirus] every minute and every day, at national, regional and global level. We are working to avoid human transmission to human. \" Tedros Ghreyesus was also concerned about the reports of suspected cases reported by the media: \"These cases are still being investigated.\" On the new coronavirus, he pointed out that although he causes light symptoms, he can become a serious illness. In fact, 25% of the cases were considered serious. He also clarified that most deadly victims had other diseases associated with hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases that weaken the immune system. He also emphasized that the WHO is working \"day and night\" with China and with other affected countries. As on Wednesday, he has returned to China for the measures he has put into practice by cooperation and transparency. \"The [Chinese] government has successfully eased and successfully sequenced the virus in a very fast way and shared the data with the WHO and the international community.\" As for restrictions, WHO (for now) does not recommend major restrictions on international or trade trips. \"[Only] we recommend tracing the airports as part of a comprehensive set of control measures [and in the affected Chinese provinces].\" All countries should still have steps to detect cases of new coronavirus. In addition, he reported that guidelines were given to all countries to identify and control the virus. \"We are completely committed to ending this outbreak as soon as possible. And I will not hesitate to gather again the Committee so \nwhich you think required. \" At the Wednesday Conference, WHO had already clarified that there is evidence that transmission happens from person to person, but that there is still no evidence that this occurs in a sustained way, that is, to form transmission chains infection that will progressively give rise to secondary or tertiary cases. Now this Thursday Tedros Adhanom Ghreyesus reinforced that there is no evidence that there has been a transmission between humans outside of China but that does not mean that it has not happened. He also said that he is not known what the origin of the outbreak is not realized with what facility transmits the virus or which are their clinical characteristics. The WHO Emergency Committee called for a coordinated response through the WHO international and multidisciplinary mission and national specialists. This mission should investigate the source of the new coronavirus, the degree of person's transmission to person, to trace other provinces of China which have not yet been affected or strengthen control measures. \"The mission should give information to the international community to assist in understanding the situation and its potential impact on public health,\" is read in a statement on the two meetings of the experts. The Emergency Committee claims to be prepared to reunite themselves in \"about ten days\" or even sooner if necessary. The Committee also leaves some \"requests\" for China, such as improving the identification of cases in other parts of the country and continue to share all data with WHO. For the remaining countries, it calls for their preparation and sharing of information. The European Disease Control and Prevention Center considers that there is a \"moderate probability of cases import in the countries of the European Union\" and that probability of secondary transmission is low provided that infection prevention and control practices are met. The European Commission has also said that it is accompanying the situation \"rather close\" and coordinating measures that may be necessary. A global emergency of public health is declared when there is \"an exceptional situation which is determined by constituting a public health risk for other states due to the international transmission of the disease and potentially requires a coordinated response at international level,\" refers to WHO. That is, it means that, in this case, the situation is considered serious, sudden, unexpected and requires immediate action at a global level. In recent times, WHO declared a global emergency of public health in 2019 due to the outbreak of Ebola virus in the Democratic Republic of Congo; in 2016, with the Zika virus; In 2014, in the previous Ebola outbreak in West Africa; in 2014, with poliomyelitis; and in 2009, in swine flu. The world was alert with the new coronavirus on December 31, 2019 when the WHO representation in China was informed of cases of an unknown cause pneumonia in the \nCity of Wuhan, in Chinese province of Hubei. On 1 January, a fish market and live animals in Wuhan was closed, where the outbreak began to be detected. Although it is suspected that the new coronavirus emerged from illegal sale of animals of that market, its origin is not yet known. The WHO indicated that the source is likely to be animal. So far, the new coronavirus - a virus group that causes respiratory infections in humans and animals and is transmitted by air or by physical contact - has already infected more than 600 people and 18 deaths (17 in Hubei and one in the province of Hebei). In addition to being scattered by large Chinese population centers such as Shanghai, Macau, Hong Kong and Beijing, the virus crossed borders and cases were detected in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, USA, Singapore and Vietnam. The fear that the virus spreads further is aggravated by the festivities of the Chinese Lunar New Year and trips that hundreds of millions of people do to celebrate. Therefore, great Chinese New Year festivities have already been canceled. Beijing canceled some of the celebrations and closed the forbidden city. Macau cleared his official parties. Hong Kong had already canceled his New Year's parade due to the protests and now chose not to perform the New Year's football tournament. Chinese authorities decided to put several cities quarantined. Wuhan, which has approximately 11 million inhabitants. All public flights and public transport were canceled. \"The quarantine of 11 million people is unpublished in the history of public health,\" said Gauden Galea, representative of WHO in Beijing, quoted by the Reuters Agency. Although the authorities ask for calm, there was a race to supermarkets and gasoline pumps. \"Today, around 10am [local time], all the boundaries of the city [of Wuhan] were closed. People were not allowed to leave. We do not know how long this will last, \"described BBC a doctor in Wuhan. \"There is no antiviral medication, we can only treat patients in a symptomatic way - by decreasing fever and good hydration.\" In Huanggang (where about seven million people live) public transport closed, cinemas and other spaces with concentration of people. People were encouraged not to leave the city. In Ezhou (a little more than one million) the train lines were suspended. With more than one million inhabitants, Xianto also canceled transport and events. The smallest cities of Chibi and Lichuan suspended their public transport. All these settlements are located in the province of Hubei. The Chinese Ministry of Finance announced that it attached 1 billion IUANs (about 130 million euros) to help fight the outbreak in that province. Chinese health authorities are accompanying almost 6,000 people who have maintained close contact with infected people. The virus incubation period may extend up to 14 days, according to the Commission \nChina's national health. Wuhan is also set up a hospital only to treat these sick, who is expected to be ready in six days, reported the Chinese newspaper Beijing News. Passengers arriving from Wuhan have been traced at airports from all over the world. According to Reuters, many Chinese have already canceled their travels.

Hong Kong has also turned two holiday fields in quarantine areas for people who may have been in contact with the virus. In Portugal, the General Health Directorate informed that any suspected cases will be referred to the Hospitals of St. John (Adults and Children) in Porto and Curry Cabral and Dona Estef\u00e2nia in Lisbon. This Thursday, the Alliance for Epidemic Epidemics (CEPI) announced that three different research teams will try to develop vaccines against the new coronavirus. The main objective is to begin in June clinical trials for at least one of the vaccines. Research teams will have different approaches: one will be led by modern pharmaceutical company together with the National Institute for allergy and US infectious diseases; another by the innovative company; And the third by a team at the University of Queensland in Australia. \"There are no guarantees of success, but we hope this work is a significant and important step in the development of a vaccine for this disease,\" said Richard Hatchett, CEPI executive director.

before putting into use,\" he said. \"the same steps have been taken in the grand hotel, where they stayed afterward. the passengers are currently in chhawla itbp camp and we are preparing to transfer them to safdarjung hospital for treatment as they have been found positive,\" he said. municipal bodies are also contacting and screening tourists from four countries -- china, iran, italy and south korea -- where most cases of the infection have come to light. the screening is being done at hotels and guesthouses in the city, he said. the new delhi municipal council (ndmc) said it has formed two

and arrested eight people it accused of being \u201crumour spreaders.\u201d \u201cthe doctor didn\u2019t wear a mask, we didn\u2019t know how to protect ourselves... no one told us anything,\u201d a 45-year-old woman surnamed chen told reuters. her aunt was confirmed to have the virus on jan. 20, five days after she was hospitalised. \u201ci posted my aunt\u2019s photos on (chinese social media site) weibo and the police called the \nhospital authorities. they told me to take it down.\u201d national, regional and city health officials did not respond to requests for comment from reuters on how the virus outbreak has been handled. national officials did say at a media briefing last week that there were some \u201cloopholes\u201d in initial treatment methods. wuhan\u2019s mayor, zhou xianwang, told chinese state television on monday he recognised that \u201call parties were not satisfied with the disclosure of our information.\u201d but he pointed to strictures placed upon him by provincial and national leaders. \u201cin local governance, after i receive information, i can only release it when i\u2019m authorized,\u201d he said. zhou told a media briefing on sunday that a further 1,000 people could be diagnosed with the virus in wuhan, based on the number of patients yet to be tested. china last week locked down the affected region in hubei province in the biggest quarantine operation on record and is building two new hospitals to treat virus patients. president xi jinping has created a special committee to tackle the outbreak. the country has been praised internationally for quickly sequencing the virus gene. however, its slow scale-up of testing has been questioned. once a virus has been identified, \u201cyou need to make sure you have all the reagent (a substance used in chemical analysis) samples and you\u2019ve got it all pushed out to where you want to do testing,\u201d said amesh adalja, a senior scholar at the johns hopkins university center for health security, who focuses on emerging infectious disease and pandemic preparedness. although information from the region is scarce, adalja suggested china has had problems with this stage of tackling the outbreak. \u201cwe\u2019re already hearing that there are shortages of medical professionals there, that there are shortages of test kits and medicines,\u201d he said. john edmunds, a professor at the centre for mathematical modelling of infectious diseases at the london school of hygiene & tropical medicine, said china has not communicated enough detailed data after the initial outbreak. \u201cwe have a very incomplete picture of what\u2019s going on,\u201d he told reuters. \u201cwhether it\u2019s incompetence, secrecy, or deliberate, i don\u2019t know, but it would be very useful if we could have some basic epidemiological data.\u201d the shortage of testing supplies and china\u2019s initial reticence have drawn criticism that the country is still learning lessons from the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) in 2002 that killed almost 800 people. \u201cthe improvements have been on the hard science side - figuring out the virus\u2019s genome, building new hospitals at a moment\u2019s notice - more than on the soft science side of managing information and dealing with people,\u201d said mary gallagher, a political science professor who leads the university of michigan\u2019s center for chinese studies. city managers had little incentive to escalate problems to political superiors. the week in which no new virus cases were reported in hubei \ncoincided with preparations for the lunar new year and sessions of the province\u2019s national people\u2019s congress and the chinese people\u2019s political consultative conference. seven of the largest hospitals in wuhan are now equipped with testing kits for the virus, which in theory deliver results within a day, the hubei cdc official said. but four people told reuters they were refused tests because the process involved a complex reporting system including hospital, district and city health authorities and disease control officials. to qualify for the test, patients need to meet certain criteria, such as having symptoms of fever and pneumonia, and a surge in patients means it is \u201cimpossible to conduct the test right away,\u201d an official at the wuhan centre for disease control and prevention told reuters. three hospital and local government workers, who have been briefed on how doctors are handling tests and confirming cases, told reuters that official numbers of infections and deaths do not reflect the actual toll. wuhan health authorities have a limit on tests, chiefly because of the shortage of testing kits, and are screening lists of patients before deciding who gets a test, which takes several hours, one hospital worker told reuters. \u201csome severely ill patients were left out from the final list for testing because they know they wouldn\u2019t be able to be treated,\u201d the worker told reuters. \u201cthe actual deaths were higher.\u201d reuters could not independently confirm the hospital worker\u2019s account. hubei and wuhan health authorities did not respond to reuters requests for comment. zhang, whose mother is still waiting for a test, said doctors at three wuhan hospitals told her family privately that they are almost certain she has contracted the coronavirus. however, he said two of those hospitals told him they are not equipped with testing kits, and the other told him it has no available bed to accommodate his mother for the test. none of those hospitals replied to reuters requests for comment. sixty-nine year-old xu enen, who has had fever and a lung infection since jan. 8, was rejected by six hospitals in wuhan for testing as they said they had ran out of beds, his daughter told reuters. xu\u2019s symptoms have worsened lately, and he is starting to have breathing difficulties. he was finally admitted on jan. 22 to queue for the test at hankou hospital in wuhan after his daughter publicized his case on weibo. researchers at lancaster university estimate that only 5.1% of infections in wuhan have been identified. by jan. 21, they estimated a total of 11,341 people had been infected in wuhan since the start of the year. more than 30,000 people in wuhan are under observation, according to the city\u2019s health authorities. \u201call we want is to confirm the case is the virus or not,\u201d said a 33-year-old wuhan woman surnamed liu, whose father has been on a respirator in hospital since jan. 14 and was still untested on monday. \u201cat least if it\u2019s confirmed we have a direction. if \nthere\u2019s no direction, there\u2019s no hope.\u201d ", "label": 1}, {"content": "Bremer economy feels impact of coronavirus. The concern for the global economy grows in the face of the spread of the coronavirus in China. According to a study, it could certainly harm the auto industry sensitive. The Deutsche Bundesbank sees risks for the German economy. According to the boss of the Institute of World Economy, Gabriel Felbermayr, the damage \"disproportionately greater\" with each day where the production facilities in the second largest economy in the world will be resting. Manufacturers in Germany and other countries rely on Chinese inputs, the supplies were not forever, Felbermayr said to the \"Handelsblatt\". The first effects are already felt in Bremen. \"Some companies resident in the city report restrictions,\" says Volkmar Herr, Managing Director of the International Commercial Chamber of Commerce. His prognosis: \"We will feel consequences in considerable width.\" Among other things, complex production chains in which Asian trading partners are significantly involved, for example through supplies of production parts. \"Many businesses do not know that parts from China are processed in their production.\" Tom Kreyenhop is a company's managing director that imports food from Asia: Kreyenhop and Kluge. So far, the consequences that the coronavirus have on his company are still manageable. \"We notice that our customers are moving with some products.\" For the importer based in Oyten, China is the second largest subscription country. Still, the warehouses are well filled, sales losses or delivery bottlenecks could not currently be recorded. \"We will probably find it in March or April based on our shopping logistics,\" says Kreyenhop. Currently, many factories are closed in China: Goods will be shipped later. This finally looks at the supply chains in Germany. For Volkmar Lord, the food area is not the only industry that will be affected by the virus and its consequences. \"The automotive industry is very important in both the import and export for Germany and China.\" There may also be problems in the field of cast iron and electrotechnical products, be it during production, because parts from China are missing, or export to the Far East. \"It is conceivable that China can not accept the goods exported here,\" says Lord. \"The virus can come to a so-called power interference. Depending on the contractual relationship, China is not obliged to accept the exported goods. \"However, however, however, the Bremen company could hit, according to the Lord can not say a flat-rate. A temporary decline in macroeconomic demand in China could dampen the German export, explains the Deutsche Bundesbank in the current monthly report. China is an important market for goods \"Made in Germany\". \nAt the same time numerous products are produced there - also for further processing in other countries. The security precautions because of the virus could affect some global value chains. \"Delivered bottlenecks in individual industries in this country would be the result,\" the Bundesbank experts write. From the point of view of the Leibniz Institute for Economic Research, the economic impact of the epidemic depends on how long the production is hindered in China. \"According to our estimation, economic growth in China could be attenuated by about 2.5 percentage points in the first quarter,\" says economic expert Roland D\u00f6hrn. Compared to the previous year, it would only be between three and four percent instead as expected at six percent. \"This development will also be noticeable in Germany, especially through lower exports and a stalling delivery of precursors by Chinese suppliers.\" As a study shows, the SARS COV-2 virus might hit the global auto industry, especially the global car industry. Alone in the particularly affected Chinese Province of Hubei, almost two million cars per year would be manufactured in good a dozen locations, it says in the analysis of the consulting company BCG. These are about eight percent of China's vehicle production. The novel coronavirus has already affected many industries, according to the study of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG). \"But the auto industry stands out as one who quickly and deep the impact is quickly and deep in view of China's crucial role.\" So the country is the largest sales market for new cars, at the same time an important location for manufacturers and suppliers. \"The auto industry is affected locally and around the globe.\" For German manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz, Audi, BMW, Volkswagen and Porsche, China is the most important market. Daimler has a work in Beijing: In the past, it was already the world's largest of the Group. At VW, the People's Republic stands for a good 40 percent of deliveries. And when switching to electro-cars, the corporations are instructed on battery cells from China. US manufacturers also depend on the Far East: GM sell more cars in China than in the US, so BCG. The novel lung disease has already met German car assemblies. So BMW had extended the Chinese New Year's holidays because of the Coronavirus at his world's largest location in the metropolitan city of Shenyang. VW had to postpone the production recording because of the epidemic partially further. The production in the works of the joint venture with Shanghai Automotive (SAIC) should only be resumed until next Monday, the Group explained. Reason are problems in supply chains and logistics as well as limited travel opportunities for employees.

  for one thing, it is convenient to take a simple, black-and-white view of a complex and stressful world.   foreigners, especially the chinese, are a convenient target if you need somebody to blame for your country\u2019s problems. thus, terms such as \u201cthe chinese virus\u201d arise, used by none other than us\u00a0president donald trump.   as united nations special rapporteur e. tendayi achiume pointed out on march\u00a023, such \"calculated use of a geographic-based name for this virus is rooted in and fosters racism and xenophobia\".      mr trump,\u00a0speaking about his administration's response to the coronavirus pandemic on\u00a0march 20, 2020, has repeatedly called the coronavirus the \u201cchinese virus\" until recently.\u00a0 \u00a0photo: the new york times   criticism of china   rather than call for a united front against the coronavirus, western columnists initially forced the spotlight on wuhan doctor li wenliang.   he had warned fellow doctors on dec 30, 2019 about a possible new virus, but was detained by police on jan 3 and accused of rumour-mongering.   however, earlier on dec 27, four unusual cases of pneumonia were already reported to the wuhan centre for diseases prevention and control (cdc).   on dec 30, active case finding began in wuhan. on dec 31, the china cdc and who were informed about the new sars-like virus. this led to the swift identification of the novel coronavirus on jan 7.   thus, the silencing of dr li on jan 3 was a botched effort to stem rumour-mongering and mass panic whilst investigations about the unknown virus were underway. dr li\u2019s raising of the alarm, while heroic and right, would have resulted in little substantive change.   alas, the west\u2019s impassioned support for dr li scarcely exists for the rest of china\u2019s medical heroes, because these individuals do not fit into a china-bashing narrative.   of course, china is far from blameless. in mid-march, it baselessly accused the us army for bringing the coronavirus to wuhan in october \n2019.   this is no better than commentators who started the \u201cchinese bioweapon\u201d infodemic.   also, the first coronavirus patients were identified on dec 8, but china only reported the outbreak to the who three weeks later, on dec 31.   even china\u2019s top leaders admitted on feb 3 \u201cshortcomings and difficulties exposed in the response to the epidemic\u201d.   a mar 3 study by the university of southampton estimated that, had non-pharmaceutical interventions (\u201cnpis\u201d, such as early detection and isolation of cases) been implemented \u201cone week, two weeks, or three weeks earlier in china, cases could have been reduced by 66 per cent, 86 per cent, and 95 per cent, respectively\u201d.   but china-bashing columnists often ignore the study\u2019s broader point: without china\u2019s subsequent interventions, infected cases \u201cwould likely have shown a 67-fold increase\u201d.   the study stresses: \u201cour results highlight that countries facing potential spread of covid-19 should consider proactively planning npis and relevant resources for containment.\u201d   regrettably, many western columnists and politicians ignored this call to action but simplistically used the study as china-bashing ammunition.   if ideologies must stay, let them be humanitarian ones.   at the level of nations, humanitarianism is when medical supplies and volunteers are flown into countries dealing with death and despair. it is when citizens of the world resolve to help each other as a single human race.   at the level of communities, humanitarianism is when masks and goods are not hoarded, so that those who need them more can have them. it is when individuals volunteer to deliver food and other necessities to homeless or self-quarantining members of their community.   and if cherished loved ones must die, let them be anti-humanitarian ideologies.   \u00a0   about the author:   ashton ng is a singaporean phd candidate in chinese history and kuok family\u2013lee kuan yew scholar at the university of cambridge.

More than 130 infected at every hourly rising case numbers, two dead, a state-of-law Giuseppe Conte on Saturday evening hurrying emergency cabinet meeting: The Coronavirus has reached Italy with force.

Harbors, airports, limits\". Salvini also wants to make the coronavirus to the subject of political polemics. He does not think to follow the desire of the government, according to which all political forces should now hold together at the crisis defense. His demand is not more purposeful: a closure of the boundaries would not be particularly useful, after all, the virus is already there. Italy is even most affected in the EU and proves fourth place in the infection numbers worldwide behind China, South Korea and Japan worldwide. There are two infection centers in northern Italy. In Lombardy, the village of Codogno is located 60 kilometers southeast of Milan, together with nine neighboring communities of the focal point. From here comes the \"patient one\", a 38-year-old man, who lies since Wednesday night with pneumonia in the intensive care unit. Already on Sunday he had to go to the hospital, but had been sent away as there was no contact with potentially infected and no journey into risk regions. At times then the suspicion came, the man had been infected with a friend since January from China - yet he had been negatively tested and had no antibodies. On these patients one go back to dozens of infections without having succeeded in identifying the patient zero, ie the beginning of the infection chain. In total, 89 Covid 19 cases are detected in Lombardy, most in the narrower crisis area, but some also in front of the gates of Milan. In Codogno, a 77-year-old died after infection with the coronavirus. Almost at the same time, the second infection center is located in the neighboring region of Veneto with the 3,000-inhabitant village Vo 'Euganeo near Padua. Here died a 78-year-old man, 19 people from the village are infected. But even here, the infection chain can not reconstruct. The original suspicion, one of the eight Chinese living in the village can stand at their beginning, did not confirm: all tests fell negative. On Saturday night, the government had decree the complete locking of the two infection herds. Similarly, the Chinese leadership in Wuhan presented, in the metropolis, the virus had occurred for the first time. The 50,000 residents from Codogno and the \nNeighboring communities as well as people from Vo 'Euganeo may not leave their municipalities. All companies, schools, restaurants, bars, shops except the supermarket and pharmacies are closed, all leisure events and also the services are canceled, the streets are empty. On Sunday, the red zone relied around Codogno, various supermarkets did not even open, while the others were empty within a few hours. Also, the buses and trains of public transport ride without support. If necessary, the army should also be used to ensure the lock. At the end of 2019, China's World Health Organization WHO reported a pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause from Wuhan. A week later, researchers identified a novel virus as the cause: they called it 2019-NCOV. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. Meanwhile, it is known as SARS COV-2 (COV stands for coronavirus, SARS for a respiratory disease triggered by a similar pathogen). SARS-COV-2 could have spread from a food market in Wuhan. There, exotic animals like reptiles were also sold. The lung disease that can trigger the new virus is now referred to as COVID-19 (English for coronavirus disease; Coronavirus disease). The disease is a so-called zoonose - a plague through a pathogen from the animal kingdom. Parts of virus bodies of SARS COV-2 same pathogens affecting bats. The new virus could have been transferred to humans via a still unknown intermediary. Both the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as well as Mers (MIDDLE East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses which have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more than 750 died. With the Mers virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. In total there are several hundred types of coronaviren. Many of them affect the respiratory tract and can cause colds. Medizors and physicians assume that the virus is transmitted above all about droplet infection from person to person. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals. More than 200,000 cases of Corona worldwide (as of March 18th) were now registered. Added to this is a high number of dark figure, the researchers roughly suspect somewhere between 50 and 80 percent of all cases. Several thousand people have demonstrably died worldwide. In most, the infection is very mild. Among the deaths are mainly people with severe pre-existence and older people. the course of the registered \nCases in Germany can be tracked here on this map. The number of infected worldwide, which have been positively tested on Corona, shows this map of Johns-Hopkins University. That can not be said yet. The WHO announced on January 28, that about one-fifth of the persons filed as an infected persons through the virus will be severely ill, so in case of doubt should be treated intensive care. Meanwhile, the WHO classifies the disease as a pandemic. Diverse states have imposed entry and outgoing restrictions to slow the spread. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. States around the world have now reported infection cases, including Germany. Researchers are currently working on therapies and vaccination. The first clinical trials with vaccines have begun, that is, a few patients are tested by testing. But it is questionable whether that is sufficient to stop a spread. Meanwhile, Turin in the northwest over the Greater Milan to Venice in the northeast of various other infectance cases outside the two infection herd has become known. Even in the south of the Lombardy and the Veneto region Emilia-Romagna, eleven cases were detected. Therefore, all regions of the north in the crisis mode switched on Sunday. In Piedmont, Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia Romagna, all universities set up the apprenticeship and audit operation. In Lombardy as well as in Veneto, the regional governments for the time being for a week has the closure of all schools. In Piedmont in turn, all hospitals are to be built in front of all hospitals in order to carry out the history of arriving patients there and thus prevent the contamination of the clinic buildings. The garden fair in Milan, which should start next week, were canceled, as well as various games of the first football league in Turin, Bergamo, Milan and Verona. And Giorgio Armani wants to let his models lanyen on the Milano Fashion Week without an audience behind closed doors. An emergency measure is already involved in Italy: the government ordered that all class trips of schools can be canceled at home and abroad.

At the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities of the World Health Organization WHO reported an accumulation of pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause in the Central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the diseases. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days then a group released a group of the virologen Christian's premier from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 the first diagnostic test for the new virus, the researcher provisionally call 2019-NCOV. With the test, the virus can be detected in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, on which, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected. Both the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as well as Mers (MIDDLE East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses which have their origins in animals.

Many of them relate to respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example. In China, several thousand persons are suffering from them, some of them - most of them with pre-existing conditions - have died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first infection cases outside of China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been in Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection with a tourist, who came back from Wuhan, on January 24, the first cases were known in France. Meanwhile, first cases were confirmed in Germany. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. The virus can cause pneumonia that can endally end. Since it is a viral illness, antibiotics do not help. Meanwhile, it is clear that the virus can be transferred from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transfers after a dozen cases were known in medical staff. Medizors assume that the virus is transmitted above all over droplet infection. The World Health Organization calculates, as announced on January 24, at the moment that an infected one cuts 1.4 to 2.5 other people. Provect this \nNumbers, the virus is less contagious than SARS and also the viral flu. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals. That can not be said yet. The World Health Organization said on 28 January that about one-fifth of the reported cases through the virus will be seriously ill, so in case of doubt must be treated intensive care. According to reports, the first death pots were patients who had some severe pre-existing conditions. Even with other infectious diseases, people with pre-existing diseases are particularly endangered - for example at the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so change their genome. This can cause you to become more dangerous for people in the course of an outbreak - but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) expects no similar mortality to the current time as the outbreak of SARS.

The recombinant human alpha 2B interferon remains news in the world and grabbing the interest of readers for their effectiveness in treatment at infected patients with the new Coronavirus SARS COV-2, causing the COVID-19 disease. The \"Cuban\" interferon is included among medications to treat in contagious patients with the new Coronavirus SARS COV-2, causing the COVID-19 disease.

It is not about Chovinism, but an accurate fact, ratified in the international prestige that enjoys the Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (CIGB). As explained Santiago Due\u00f1as Carrera, general vicegerete of the Mixed Company Changchun Heber Biological Technology - which precisely the interferon alfa 2b with Cuban technology - the decision to have created this entity, in 2003, departed from the common interest of Cuba and China to develop The production and marketing of biotechnological products, from the experience accumulated by Cuban scientists in this area. For this purpose, he assured, is that technology transfer begins, and also of knowledge, of the CIGB towards the new mixed company for the manufacture of this therapeutic medication, with antiviral action, a process that ended in 2007 with the obtaining of the sanitary registry. \"As of that moment, interferon begins to be used to treat certain conditions such as hepatitis B and C, until it is incorporated into China's health insurance, which has allowed 20 regions of that country.\" While it is true that when Changchun Heber is based, interferon already had a history of use in different countries, the Chinese Government recognized the capacity of the Cuban biotechnology industry to develop safe and effective products, it licensed. \"Currently, this medicine is produced in the mixed company in four main formats, all injectable, and with different doses: 3, 5, 6 and 10 million international units per vial, as long as it began its commercialization in 2007 and even End of 2019, more than four million doses had been administered, which involve more than 100,000 patients in that country. \"This is the antecedent of how the interferon 'Cuban' came to China and the prior use that has had to the current epidemiological situation,\" he says. As of the spread of the new Coronavirus, \"he repeated,\" the Asian Giant Health Commission requested interferon producing companies, including Changchun Heber, delivering this medication to the health system. \u00abIt is not the only drug to face the pandemic, but one of the most used for the \nTreatment of the COVID-19, especially in aerosol format \u00bb. A little history to understand how production arises in Cuba del interferon alfa 2b, you have to go back to house number 149, of the Atabey distribution, in Havana, which barely had about 180 square meters, but where professionalism and the commitment. Even if we are faithful to history, we have to say that \"was the commander in chief Fidel Castro Ruz, with the visionary light of him, who understood the need for Cuba to be inserted in the field of modern biotechnologies.\" This states Gustavo Furrazola G\u00f3mez, profession biologist and founder of the CIGB. This project started in 1981, after Fidel met with the American doctor Randolph Lee Clark. \"On that occasion, the leader of the Cuban Revolution had asked him about the most innovative treatments that were used internationally for the treatment of cancer, and Lee Clark told him about the interferon that was being developed in the hospital he directed in Texas. From that meeting, two Cuban scientists traveled to Texas to receive some training \u00bb. Subsequently, another four specialists would be integrated, who traveled to Professor Kari Cantell's lab, in Helsinki, Finland, who had obtained for the first time the interferon molecule in 1972. Once the scientists returned to Cuba and, with the Support from other professionals, that \"casita\", adapted as a laboratory, was an epicenter of intense work, until it was possible to produce, on May 28, 1981, the first interferon in our country, from white blood cells, said Baulrazola G\u00f3mez . Necessary precisions \"When the Cuban biotechnology industry initiated the production of interferon, a technology was used very similar to that applied by the pharmaceutical company Schering-Plow Corporation, based in the United States. \"However, we began to develop its own aspects and particularities in the technology used, in search of improvements to the productive process,\" recalls Ya\u00ed Cruz Ruiseco, current Director of Imports of the CIGB, who, in addition, worked for 16 years in the production line . The developed investigations allowed us to reach a practice endowed in the establishment and escalation for the production of the medicine in question, and thanks to this technology, we have been able to reach 99% of purity in obtaining the interferon molecule, which is fine Complex, in addition to the lots have a high level of efficiency and safety, he adds. In the production process of interferon alfa 2b, the CIGB works as a whole with the National Biopreparado Center (Biocen), especially in the second stage, which consists of the filling or lyophilization of the product as finished. We have always worked as a whole with the clinical part and research based on the new applications that this drug may have in \nPatients, because although it is mainly used to treat carcinogenic conditions, it also has antiviral properties. It is worth noting, he adds, that this drug has been used in other epidemiological situations in Cuba, such as the hemorrhagic dengue epidemic in 1981, and in the 1990s of the last century, to treat conjunctivitis of viral origin, on this occasion in Form of colir. It is not surprising then that, before the COVID-19, the CICB works uninterruptedly to multiply the productions and that workers like Gustavo Furrazola, they feel proud to participate in obtaining a medication that helps others, regardless of the hours of work .

On huge roles, the fabric goes to nine approaches, especially in Asia, where the overalls are then manufactured.

First, China's leadership had to make the reproach to have acted too hesitantly on the outbreak of the coronavirus. Then she laid the land quasi quiet and imposed mass quarantine. What led to the economy caught. Now China's leadership is trying to find a balance: take the virus seriously, but not at the expense of the economy. And that's not really succeeding. China's state and party leader Xi Jinping has already asked its compatriots to return to production facilities at the beginning of the past few weeks and resume their work. In regions where the risk is \"comparatively low\", production should be fully absorbed, it is said in the arrangement. The fight against the virus should only be confined to preventing an introduction. Say: controls and fever measuring points at stations, airports and shopping malls will continue to give it. Otherwise, life should be normalized. And in areas with a \"mean risk\", people should resume their work again and check the authorities only \"depending on the local situation of the epidemic\", whether quarantine measures are further attached. Exempted from this request, the regions particularly affected by the Coronavirus SARS-COVID-19 remain ahead of the Crisis Province Hubei, where the outbreak took its start and the number with almost 70,000 infected the number with a great distance worldwide is highest. These regions should continue to \"focus full on control and prevention,\" ordered XI. In fact, in almost half of all circles in China, no infected has been registered at all. Above all, the northeast with his heavy industry has given official numbers only little infected. Economic life still stood still throughout the country. The Purchasing Manager Index (PMI), a central index for the production of all Chinese works, dropped to under 38 points in February; Everything below 50 points indicates a shrinkage of production. The value since the introduction of the index 2005 in China has never been so low. In the range of services, the index sank even below 30 points. The leadership had the fight to the virus and had to hold on all the officials, describes EU Chamber Chamber President J\u00f6rg Wuttke the procedure of the central government in Beijing. For this had to be made smears and that hit the economy: \"Now it is important to come back from this extreme.\" The interests for entrepreneurs have already lowered the central bank, and the central government announced further major investments in infrastructure projects. Nevertheless, economic life is not sure. Also in Beijing and Shanghai, the numbers with less than 500 infected relatively low and they have not risen in the last few days. Of a normalization of economic life \ncan still be no question. On the streets has been stirring for several days at peak times of the traffic, while most office towers and shopping malls have reopened. But residents report that the shops are further empty. In Beijing's popular burning quarter SanLitun, for example, the few employees would only get along bored. There are contradictory information about the resumption of production facilities. In the East Chinese high-tech city Hangzhou for example: here also the Tech Group is located Alibaba. According to official information, almost 95 percent of the city-based companies \"resumed their ordinary surgical processes\". 85 percent of employees have returned to their jobs. Nationwide, it says, should, at least about 65 percent of the large corporations and around 40 percent of the middle and small companies have pushed production again. But foreign companies report something else. They complain that most of the companies would continue to rest. The employees were missing simply. Many of the nationwide 300 million migrant workers and migrant workers had followed the call of the central government after the Chinese New Year, not to return to the industrial regions. Now Beijing asks you exactly. But for fear of the virus, they would stay in their home villages. This also helped the problems with the supply chains. The companies lack important intermediates. And the different regulations are also a big problem. \"The patching carpet of contradictory regulations that the fight against Covid-19 had produced hundreds of different power ranges that make it almost impossible to move goods or people in China,\" also complains of EU Chamber President Wuttke.

arrived before the coronavirus did.   one girl headed for the stairs as soon as ms zhou stepped up to a dormitory lift bank in late january. when two construction workers saw a poster of asian candidates in the student union election, they muttered, \"vote corona.\"   but now that the virus has firmly taken hold in britain, outmuscling the low-key measures taken by prime minister boris johnson, chinese students are fretting for a different reason.   \"people here haven't realised how serious this is,\" ms zhou said. \"over in china, there were a lot of control mechanisms in place, but not here yet.\"   that wariness towards the way british universities have handled the outbreak could soon have huge financial implications. universities in english-speaking countries, especially britain, australia and the united states, have grown increasingly dependent on tuition from chinese students, a business model that the virus could dismantle.   with qualifying exams postponed, travel bans spreading and anger rising among chinese students and parents at the west's permissive attitude toward public health, enrolment could plummet in the coming years, experts said, potentially leaving countries with multi-billion-dollar holes in their universities' budgets.   already, analysts are talking about the prospect of government bailouts of higher education if chinese students stay home, starving universities of the often-exorbitant overseas tuition fees that keep their less-profitable departments afloat.   \"in quite a short period of time, we have become sort of addicted to one source of income,\" said prof kerry brown, a professor of chinese studies at king's college london. \"if the worst case happens and chinese students don't want to come here in september, it's potentially a kind of seismic change.\"   in britain, some chinese students are fuming that universities did not act more decisively to move classes online and scrap major events like spring balls. in interviews, they said they were weighing the health benefits of wearing a surgical mask with their fear of being racially abused or even attacked, as a student from singapore was last month in london.   now that china has seemingly corralled its outbreak, some students are even swallowing the cost of expensive plane tickets and rushing home.   in australia, where the academic year began around the end of february, an entry ban on anyone who had recently been in china stranded tens of thousands of chinese students at home.   the outbreak has grown enough in australia, though, that analysts fear the next travel ban will be imposed by the chinese, with the government potentially asking students not to travel to virus-prone countries for schooling.   and in the united states, swift shutdowns left international students without any help as they packed up \nand tried to find affordable flights home.   taken together, those slights and miscalculations have dented the reputation of overseas universities in china, analysts said.   us universities were already hurt by trade tensions between washington and beijing and new visa restrictions on chinese graduates. and british universities, too, are dealing with uncertainty over european union research money and student-exchange programmes after brexit.   university administrators are bracing for parents already wary of the risks of global travel in the age of the virus to decide it is no longer worth shelling out tens of thousands of dollars for an overseas degree.   \"i think this is going to exacerbate the sense that has been growing for years that the uk, and to a lesser extent the us, are not great destinations for international students, especially chinese students,\" said prof craig calhoun, a professor of social sciences at arizona state university and a former director of the london school of economics and political science.   \"applications and acceptances could go down precipitously, and i think very few uk universities have planned for that.\"   in britain, universities began chasing after chinese students amid declining government funding, combined with a move by indian students to enrol in us schools instead. last year, more than 120,000 chinese students enrolled in britain, with some major universities' student bodies now a fifth chinese.   conservative estimates put their combined fees at about \u00a31.5 billion (s$2.53 billion). many enrol in postgraduate business and finance programmes that are the universities' biggest moneymakers.   \"if enrolment falls by a quarter, that's a huge amount of money and, for some universities, the difference between bankruptcy and staying afloat,\" prof brown said.   almost 400,000 chinese students were studying in us universities last year. australia has become even more reliant on chinese recruitment: with 200,000 chinese students, it stood to lose about us$4 billion (s$5.8 billion), by some estimates, had the coronavirus-related travel ban kept them from attending the first term.   \"in australia and new zealand, the approach has been to treat international students as cash cows, and as a result, the shortcomings in their systems are really coming to the surface,\" said prof salvatore babones, an associate professor at the university of sydney and an adjunct scholar at the centre for independent studies. \"we're essentially just running an offshore university experience at the master's level.\"   china, desperate to fill universities hollowed out under the one-child policy, has lately improved the quality of its own higher education system, tempting some students to stay home.   british university administrators now fear that those changes, combined with china's success in battling the coronavirus, could make the case for an overseas education more difficult.   mr zhexuan lu, a second-year student in sports management \nat the university of bath, said he was surprised to find the british government ignoring the virus when the spring term started in january.   few countries have since charted such a different course from china than britain, which initially hesitated to shut restaurants and pubs. china, by contrast, has reported reducing its new local cases to zero by heavily curtailing people's movements.   as the president of the bath chinese students and scholars association, mr lu sent a letter to the university's vice-chancellor asking for more lectures and course notes to be made available online. but he said the university was reluctant to do more until there was a confirmed case of the virus on campus.   \"nobody worried about it except chinese students, because chinese students know what happened and what helped in our home country,\" mr\u00a0lu said.   nevertheless, he\u00a0said that younger chinese students applying to british universities would not be deterred by the way britain responded to the coronavirus, saying the virus would pass.   should it remain a threat for longer, though, prof babones said, there was a risk that china would reciprocate other countries' travel bans by considering asking its students not to go abroad for their studies, fearing that they would bring the virus back from a country where it was more rampant.   \"it'd be a big propaganda win,\" he said. \"you kept our students out? now we're pulling them out.\"   some british universities are considering offering preterm english courses online and allowing chinese students to delay their enrolments until january next year. some have also tried to diversify their international student body in recent years, although analysts warned that was unlikely to compensate for any financial losses from china.   while britain's departure from the european union will pile pressure on its universities, the government has said it will extend the visas of international students as a way of persuading them to stay.   in some ways, british universities' response to the virus reflects the muddled messages coming from the prime minister's office, which has been reluctant to impose any mandates and slow to discourage large gatherings.   in one e-mail that upset students at the university of cambridge, administrators insisted that the business school would hold exams last week in rooms of up to 40 people, despite students' fear of the crowds. the university said it and its colleges were \"doing all in their power to prepare students and staff for unforeseeable circumstances\".   for ms zhou, the postgraduate officer in the student union at the university of bath, being in britain during the time of the virus meant fielding worried phone calls from her mother.   it has also meant trying to adjust to the more relaxed views of others, like a man to whom she tried to sell

Management Government in Belgium is fully powers until the summer. Belgian political parties have reached an agreement with a view to granting \"special powers\" to the current management government led by the First Minister Sophie Wilm\u00e8s in order to allow an appropriate response to the outbreak of the new coronavirus.\nThe political agreement reached between \"10 democratic parties\" - excluding the Flemish nationalist party of extreme right Vlaams Belang and the Radical Left Francophone Party PTB - which predicts that the current management government is an executive in full exercise Summer, it was reached last night, it should be 'validated' this Monday by King Philippe and approved by the Senate by the end of the week.\nThe reinforced powers will, however, be limited to all measures to combat Covid-19 outbreak, namely budgetary and sanitary level.\nBelgium has no government in full exercise of functions since December 2018, when N-VA's Flemish nationalists have withdrawn their support for the coalition in power, dropping the executive led by the now President of the European Council, Charles Michel.\nThe national elections of May 2019, carried out on the same day as the European elections, plunged the country into a new political impasse and, after almost 10 months, negotiations are continued for the formation of a government, which are now temporarily suspended.\nAlso in Belgium, the virus continues to propagate, and the new cases of infection were confirmed this Monday, which elevates the total in the country to 1,058, having already registered five deaths.\nThe new coronavirus responsible for Covid-19 pandemic, detected last December in China, has already caused more than 6,500 dead worldwide.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), the epicenter of the pandemic moved from China to Europe, where the second most serious case is situated, that of Italy, which announced on Sunday 368 new deaths in the last 24 hours Rising for more than 1,800 the number of mortal victims in the country.\nThe number of world-class infected the 170,000 people, with cases registered in at least 148 countries and territories, including Portugal, which has 245 confirmed cases. Of the total of infected, more than 77 thousand recovered. ", "label": 1}, {"content": "Important information about the coronavirus. More and more clearly distinguishes in Germany: SARS-COV-2 will not be stopped. What is known about the virus and the disease he caused Covid-19? How strong will SARS-COV-2 spread in Germany? \"With further cases, infection chains and also outbreaks in Germany must be expected,\" says the Robert Koch Institut (RKI) in Berlin. Since there is no immunity in the population against a new pathogen, a propagation shaft can capture large parts thereof. The Berliner virologist Christian Riding expects a total high infection numbers for Germany. \"It will probably infect 60 to 70 percent, but we do not know what time,\" he said. \"That can last two years or even longer.\" What does the epidemic mean for the health system and society? It depends significantly from a factor: the speed of the spread. The better it is to keep the rate of infections to keep less, the lower the pressure on the medical system and society will be, explains. The problematic becomes problematic, especially when it gets compressed in a short time. Then full waiting areas and medical practices threatened, occupied intensive care beds and completely overloaded health insurance offices. Many workers would be missing, even in schools, institutes and other facilities, there could be problems for sick personnel. The estimates presented by the British Government may, in the course of the progressive disease wave in the high-phase, may fail any fifth worker. How contagious is the new coronavirus? A value of how many other people infected in the remedy can not be specified yet. It is the most difficult factor to be assessed, explains the result. There are indications that an infected one is infected three more people - but this value is subject to great uncertainties. An epidemic is stopped when an infected statistically infected on average less than another person. The virus increases in the throat and spreads mainly through droplets for about coughing and talking. \"The flying maybe such a one and a half feet wide and fall relatively quickly to the ground,\" explains RD. \"It is the inhalation of such a cloud that infects one in most cases.\" Only in contact situations, there is a real risk - for example, if you have spoken with an infected over a quarter of an hour or more. The incubation time - the period between infection and start of symptoms - is usually 2 to 14 days after the current level. This is the reason that suspected cases are isolated two weeks. How dangerous is the virus? Most people have only a slight cold symptom with shiver and sore throat or no \nSymptoms. Fever and cough, as they also occur with a flu. Even headaches or diarrhea are possible. About 15 out of 100 infected ill people, as it was called by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). They get about breathing problems or pneumonia. Affected are mostly people from risk groups such as cancer patients in chemotherapy, old people and those with preheating diseases such as cardiovascular diseases or in diabetes returning organ damage. Deaths - for example due to respiratory arrest, septic shock or multi-organ failure - are rare. After current data, the COVID-19 death rate is about 0.3 to 0.7 percent, says outside. This means that from 1000 infected 3 to 7 die. Probably the actual rate is even underneath. An evaluation in China had recently revealed that in the country about 2.3 percent of the SARS COV-2 infected die. Experts assume that this estimate is too high because many mild infections are not incorporated into statistics. According to the same evaluation, the death rate in humans over 80 years is almost 15 percent, so in this age group in China after the present statistics are about 15 out of 100 infected. In the group of 10 to 39 years old people, it is 0.2 percent of the infected, ie about 2 out of 1,000 concerned. How can the new lung disease be treated? There is no special therapy for the COVID-19 disease. Heavy-patients are treated symptomatically: with fever-lowering agents, the therapy of any bacterial additional infections and sometimes mechanical ventilation. In individual cases, antiviral drugs are also tested. Is there a protective vaccine? no. Several laboratories worldwide are currently researching vaccines as they are available for the flu. The development of a vaccine takes a lot of time. Suminya Swaminathan, chief scientist at the World Health Organization (WHO) believes that a certified vaccine is probably only available for the far-reaching commitment in 18 months. According to Health Minister Alex Azar, the US pharmaceutical approval authority FDA gave green light for the first clinical tests of a potential vaccine against the novel coronavirus. The director of the National Institute for Infectious Diseases, Anthony Fauci, emphasized, thus nothing to change the previous schedule for a possible vaccine. \"The whole process will take at least one or a year and a half.\" How can I protect myself from infectance? To protect against this as well as other viruses, experts recommend ordinary hygiene measures: regular hand washing, disinfectant and distance to suffice. The benefits of normal breathing masks appreciate experts as rather low. It can help to restrict hugs and shaking hands and surfaces touched by many people \nDoor laps, handles and elevator buttons do not touch. When staying in public rooms you should avoid touching the nasal mucous membranes and the rubbing of the eyes, said the Greifswalder Hygienist doctor G\u00fcnter fight. \"The virus wants to go into the respiratory tract.\" Arriving at home should be thoroughly thoroughly washing the hands. Can I infect myself if I get a package from China or other risk regions? Basically, it is unclear how long the virus survives on surfaces, it says from the WHO. Studies suggested that there are a few hours or days - depending on conditions such as surface, temperature or moisture. The likelihood that an infected goods contaminated with the virus is classified by the authority as low. The risk that a recipient is indicated by a packet exposed on the transport of different conditions and temperatures is low. Imported foods and goods such as toys, computers or clothing are unlikely as infection sources, says the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR). Can my pet transfer the virus? A transmission risk due to pets is hardly available according to an expert. A case reported in South Korea, where SARS COV-2 should have been demonstrated in a dog, was not confirmed in scientific literature, said Albert Osterhaus, virologist at the Veterinary University of Hanover. You can not completely exclude it completely, but it is not likely that this can play a role for transferring people - if at all, then over the skin and the coat. What do I do if I'm afraid of being infected? Under no circumstances go directly into a practice or emergency room. Anyone who has symptoms and, for example, because of the contact to a demonstrably infected - feared to be ill at Covid-19, should first be reported by telephone at his family doctor or the health department. \"Because if you really should be sick, then you do not necessarily have to put that in a fully occupied waiting room with any in any case weakened immune systems,\" explains the spokesman for the German Hospitality Association, Christian Jewelry. In several federal states, there is currently the consideration to set up special centers as a contact point for possible SARS COV infected. At the Berlin Charit\u00e9 for example, such a separate examination office for suspected cases is already in operation. What may the state in an emergency? The essential regulates the nationwide valid Infection Protection Act (IFSG). A spokesman for the Bavarian Ministry of Health summarizes: \"If necessary, important fundamental rights such as freedom of the person, assembly freedom or inviolability of the apartment as well as the right to physical integrity can be restricted.\" Authorities may, according to the Bayreuth State Legal Property Stephan Rixen Blood Assumptions and Scrolls of \nSkin and mucous membranes demand. Even \"disease suspects\" and \"infectual suspect\" - as the law expresses it - could be imposed on a professional ban. To protect others, people could also \"be separated in a suitable hospital or otherwise suitably\", it says in the law. Will the situation change in spring? The flu and other cold diseases have in winter high season. Even with SARS-COV-2, there is the hope that the epidemic could be drained in the warmer months - at least at least. Helping effects are trees, according to \"the heat in summer, UV rays and the fact that people are increasingly outside and can infect less to each other\". In the second half of the year, however, it would then have to set itself in Europe that it becomes colder again and this additional effect is trap.

 \n the virus is believed to have originated late last year in afood market in the chinese city of wuhan that was illegallyselling wildlife. health experts think it may have originated inbats and then passed to humans, possibly via another animalspecies.  \n the world health organization (who) was alerted to severalcases of pneumonia in wuhan at the end of december. chineseauthorities confirmed they had identified a new virus a weeklater.  \n  \n how dangerous is it?

 \n the new coronavirus can be transmitted from person toperson, although it is not clear how easily that happens. mostcases so far are in people who have been in wuhan, familymembers of those infected, or medical workers.  \n transmission is most likely through close contact with aninfected person via particles in the air from coughing orsneezing, or by someone touching an infected person or objectwith the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose oreyes.  \n in order to reduce the likelihood of transmission, the whorecommends that people frequently wash their hands, cover theirmouth and nose when sneezing or coughing, and avoid closecontact with those who are sick.  \n the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention saysthose who develop symptoms such as coughing and fever who havebeen in china in the last 14 days should call ahead to ahealthcare professional to establish if they need to be tested.  \n  \n where has it spread to so far?  \n the vast majority of the more than 8,000 cases so faridentified have been in china, mostly in and around wuhan. theother countries with confirmed cases include australia,cambodia, canada, france, germany, japan, malaysia, nepal, srilanka, singapore, thailand, south korea, the uae, the unitedstates, and vietnam.  \n the who is looking very closely at cases of person-to-persontransmission outside of wuhan, which would suggest that it mayhave the potential to spread further.  \n  \n what are authorities doing?

On Friday morning, a Berlin family doctor is no longer able to help and post on Facebook: \"Shortly we will expect disinfectants, protective masks and protective coat.

Other clinics on the recommendation of the Robert Koch Institute about creating places in front of the patient room, where everyone who can use a personal mask, which he uses only in a particular patient - so the carers and nurses the masks in the layer several times can use. The fight against the coronavirus is also a material battle. And the material is currently scarce everywhere. Virend density protective masks and suits are as important for employees in hospitals and medical practices as helmet and respiratory protective equipment for firefighters with a fire. Without appropriate equipment, \"you can certainly not expect from the employees to continue working here,\" says Uwe Janssens. He is President of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (Divi). Janssens also sees with concern that inventories will not be enough in many clinics: \"We've actually have too few resources in this area in Germany, especially in Germany, which applies in particular to the special FFP2 masks, which in direct contact with Covid 19 diseased patients should be used. \" Johannes Pott is intensive physician at St. Bernward Hospital in Hildesheim.

He still fears an emergency, the hospital has several thousand masks with the appropriate virus protection in stock. \"We will give you for four weeks.\" Nevertheless, L\u00fcersen appeals to politics: \n\"We continue to urgently need your help with the procurement of protective clothing, ventilatories and disinfectants. Otherwise, we can not guarantee safe patient care in the long term.\" In the Federal Government you have heard the help learn. On Wednesday, Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn, ten million protective masks were arrived and could be distributed. His ministry shares demand, the first deliveries with medical protective equipment went on Friday from depots of the Bundeswehr to the Kassen\u00e4rztlichen associations and the federal states. \"Over the weekend further deliveries are to be expected, so that protective masks can also be distributed as soon as possible about the Kassen\u00e4rztliche Association and the federal states to the practices, the nursing homes and the hospitals,\" says a spokeswoman. The procurement of the medical material had taken over the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Finance. Both ministries entertain large procurement offices. The Bundeswehr and the General Collector have closed various contracts with suppliers, of disinfectants and disposable gloves up to masks and protective suits. Overall, the order volume is so far at 241 million euros. In these delivery contracts, the batch of ten million masks mentioned by Health Minister Spahn was reportedly included. The offers were obtained mainly in German companies, but also in Europe and worldwide, says a spokeswoman of the Ministry of Defense. \"We need to examine the course and sort out, after all, certain requirements must be fulfilled and we get scary many dubious offers.\" Some things are harder than others, but overall the procurement is very good. The Bundeswehr also represents the corresponding logistics to store the material first, so the goods are delivered at depots of the Bundeswehr. The Ministry of Health then coordinates the distribution. In addition to the procurement, the policy is struggling to promote the production of protective material. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Friday in Germany radio, they have asked all companies that produce protective clothing, highlight their production significantly. And \"We asked other companies to change their production streets and now only produce this medical material.\" But between political will and practical implementation still gives a gap. For example, the material should be distributed after \"urgency and actual needs\", as a spokesman of the German Hospital Society says. However, what that means concretely, no one could say so far. Obviously, no one has an overview of which clinic and practice just like much material. Also the manufacturers of such goods are missing information. Ming Gutsche provides with her \nCompany Roof in Rastatt in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg since 1996 Medical protective clothing. How almost all manufacturers of such products also produces roof most in China. Your customers are hospitals, but also pharmacon cores and food industry. Since the beginning of the corona pandemic they only supplies hospitals and rescue services. Nevertheless, she was \"completely sold out,\" says Gutsche. Several containers from China are still expecting them, but they are already planned. In order not to get into such a situation, she now wants to build its own production as quickly as possible. For this she has developed three machines in cooperation with a Swabian machine manufacturer and made agreements with German manufacturers of nonwoven fabrics. In the three-layer system, it could make every day up to half a million respiratory protective masks, estimates Gutsche. In no later than eight weeks, production should start. Provided, there are accelerated official procedures by the federal government and no COVID-19-related failures with suppliers. The Federal Association Medical Technology (BVMED) already warns that the delivery of preliminary products for protective equipment could come to bottlenecks, especially in materials manufactured in Southeast Asia. Protective material has been barely stored so far, says Bvmed spokesman Manfred Beeres: \"Above all, not in hospitals. They have managed all just in time.\" Now some manufacturers were under pressure because some clinics did not pay their invoices or only delayed. \"They now have their own liquidity problems.\" The same is heard from circles of the hospital societies.

", "label": 0}, {"content": "Coronavirus: What can Europe learn from China?. At present, more than 140 countries reported outbreaks of the new epidemic, and the number of worldwide diagnosed cases hampered almost 200,000. The fight against this new disease does not imply that only health professionals are placed on the front line, but also that all the people and their rulers are aligned and facing side by side this battle. But at this time the following question should be placed: what is more interested in our rulers, the defense of life and the well-being of your people or before the economic development of a country? By Chinese experience, it became clear that the best way to control the epidemic is the reduction as much as possible, of the flow of people and goods. However, behind this difficult decision to paralyze the productive tissue of a country, the fear of a new financial crisis arises. But if we imagine that the epidemic can not be attenuated, how can we re-release the economy of a country in the eventual case of disorder, allied to collapse from national health systems? At this time, the decision-making of governments have to put the core in the defense of their people's lives. Thus, due to the severity of the pandemic in Europe, Portugal must seriously respect the statement of the emergency state. After the outbreak of the epidemic in Wuhan, the Chinese hospitals were placed in the first line of defense, in order to avoid the spread of this war with invisible enemies. Fever measurements at hospital reception, to quickly detect contaminations, available 24 hour and online consultations served to avoid cross-infections. The constant disclosure of the number and location of the infected and recommendations that the common citizen can implement to avoid the spread of the disease reinforced confidence in the fight against the epidemic. At the provincial level, local governments announce daily the number of confirmed infections, by parish, both online on the official websites, or in regional television channels. In addition, the central government has developed and has updated a computer application that allows you to see on a map where people are infected. Such application allows those who have to travel to take precautions and avoid affected areas. Another measures consisted in rationalization and distribution of communities surgical masks. In large Chinese cities, most of the population lives in communities, a kind of condominium with private security managed by a committee. These committees have distributed protective masks, depending on the needs per apartment. Due to optimization in delivery of masks, the influence to pharmacies has been reduced. Further, the committees were organized to measure the temperature of each person who leaves the Community in order to impind possible cases of contamination, and have issued access cards to their residents in order to avoid entering strangers in condominiums. \nIn the communities where there are residents in permanent insulation by infection, it is also the Committee that ensures the purchase of daily foods and goods of the quarantined residents. In addition, even in Wuhan, the epicenter of this catastrophe, every day the government has secured food replacement, which avoided generalized panic situations in supermarkets. In a moment of serious crisis like this, another crucial question puts: for the people, what is now more important? Affirm the supremacy of individual freedom or safety, well-being and future of the nation? Some news of the last few days that show the lack of awareness in the European population of the new coronavirus gravity, allied with the lack of firm and objective measures on the part of the rulers, stress both for the future of democratic values \u200b\u200band for collective well-being . In Portugal, despite the lack of assertiveness of government agencies, we had, however, an excellent example of President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. After learning that he would probably have contacted with infected students, the president chose not to take risks and canceled all his public activities. In this way, he appealed with his example to the whole country in the form of self-insulation, demonstrating that Covid-19 should not be seen with levity. However, there were several caricated phenomena in Portugal, such as the case of young people gathered on the beach after the closing decision of some universities and the bars that created a thematic party about coronavirus to attract customers. Coincidentally, this type of bizarre behavior has occurred a little throughout Europe: in the Italian Parliament who uses mask is ridiculed, in the United Kingdom to organize concerts of thousands of people in the midst of this crisis. Throughout Europe, indescribable scenes have been made of \"Persecution of Individual Freedom\", but this highly individualistic and selfish vision on the face of an infectious crisis will not only be stupidity? Is the virus worried about individual freedom? The viruses only care about their own freedom. When people walk on the street without protective measurements, the spread of the virus spreads through all the locations, even if it is not noted.

Cuvid-19 began to spread by China exactly at the height of the Chinese New Year, a period when tradition forces us to meet the family. However, even in this period, the Chinese population prioritized the conclusion of the importance of cropping the advancement of the virus as soon as possible, implementing unprecedented national isolation. In a power with 1.4 billion people, the entire population was voluntarily at home and canceled meetings, family visits and travel. the most famous sights of Shanghai, which every day attracted thousands of people, have become \nEmpty, making us wonder if this almost post-apocaplitic scenario is really the city that once we chose to live. Whether it is in major cities or in the most remote villages, some of the methods of combating disease can be considered extravagant, but to prevent the virus just wash their hands often and stay at home. In the famous work the three musketeers, written by Alexandre Dumas, there is a dictation that fits perfectly with Europe at this time: \"One for all, all for one.\" Faced with the common threat of the new coronavirus, human beings are a single common destination community. At this moment the collective is more important than institutional dilemmas, nationalisms and individualisms. All people can contribute to the fight against coronavirus. The main objective of eliminating this pandemic can not be achieved without the joint efforts of the entire population.

Swine flu, caused by the H1N1 influenza virus, was developed as a pandemic between 2009 and 2010. The new influenza emerged in April 2009 in Mexico and the United States.

with its emergence as the nation's biggest coronavirus hot spot a warning flare -- and perhaps a cautionary tale -- for the rest of the country. a makeshift morgue was set up outside bellevue hospital, and the city's police, their ranks dwindling as more fall ill, were told to patrol nearly empty streets to enforce social distancing. public health officials hunted down beds and medical equipment and put out a call for more doctors and nurses for fear the number of sick will explode in a matter of weeks, overwhelming hospitals as has happened in italy and spain. in washington, president donald trump implored congress to move on critical coronavirus aid without further delay. senate leaders were trying to overcome late objections to a $2 trillion economic rescue package to ease the financial pain of the pandemic. worldwide, the death toll climbed past 20,000, according to a running count kept by johns hopkins university. the number of dead in the us topped 900, with more than 60,000 infections. new york state alone accounted for more than 30,000 cases and close to 300 deaths, most of them in new york city. gov. andrew cuomo, again pleading for help in dealing with the onslaught, attributed the cluster to the city's role as a gateway to international travelers and the sheer density of its population, with 8.6 million people sharing subways, elevators, apartment buildings and offices. \"our closeness makes us vulnerable,\" he said. \"but it's true that your greatest weakness is also your greatest strength. and our closeness is what makes us who we are. that is what new york is,\" cuomo said. some public health experts also attributed the city's burgeoning caseload in part to the state's big push to test people. troy tassier, a fordham university professor who studies economic epidemiology, suggested the increase shows new york would have fared better had it acted sooner to order social distancing. nearly 7 million people in the san francisco area were all but confined to their homes on march 17, and california put all 40 million of its residents under a near-lockdown three days later. the order to stay at home in new york state did not go into effect until sunday evening, march 22, and new york city's 1.1 million-student school system was not closed until march 15, well after other districts had shut down. dr. mark dworkin, an epidemiology professor at university of illinois-chicago, said he hadn't followed new york's situation closely enough to say whether he would have done it differently, but he noted that moving quickly is critical -- and sometimes difficult to do at early points, when the public doesn't sense an imminent threat. \"at first, i think there's a certain amount of disbelief that goes on,\" he said. \"i think that contributes, to some extent, to the lack of \nputting the foot on the gas pedal on some of the control measures that we know we need to do.\" after new york's first positive test came back on march 1 - in a health care worker who had traveled to iran and secluded herself upon returning - mayor bill de blasio and cuomo initially cast the disease as a dangerous threat but one
