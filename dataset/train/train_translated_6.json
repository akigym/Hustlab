[{"content": "cleaning product makers race to labs to bolster coronavirus claims. as global makers of household cleaners race to pitch their products as coronavirus killers, one major company, reckitt benckiser, may have a leg up on the competition.    the maker of lysol and dettol disinfectants said it has already obtained a strain of the novel coronavirus, known as sars-cov-2, from an independent lab and plans to use the strain to test whether its products kill the virus.    watchdogs in the united states and europe stipulate that a product must be tested in a regulator-approved lab to prove it can be effective against 99.9% of a virus before it can make a virus-killing claim on its label or in ads. in 2012, for instance, when mers-coronavirus was a major public health concern, cleaning products had to prove they could kill 9,999 out of 10,000 mers-coronavirus cells, according to the agencies\u2019 requirement.    covid-19, the disease caused by novel coronavirus, originated in wuhan, china, and has spread to more than 100 countries across the world.    the pandemic presents both a challenge and an opportunity for marketers of household brands to show how their products can help consumers deal with a frightening and fast-developing public health crisis. doing it right could mean added market share; doing it badly will likely have other consequences.    \"this coronavirus is the new hype,\" said michael reynen, the former research head of procter & gamble's surface care business in parts of europe, the middle east and africa.    british consumer goods maker reckitt told reuters it procured a sample of the novel coronavirus strain a few days ago and will soon be testing its existing disinfectants for commercial use at a virology lab.    the lab, which reckitt declined to name, is in the process of duplicating the virus samples to enable sufficient quantities for testing, it said. the lab can test six reckitt benckiser products per week, with results of the first batch expected by the end of april, the company said.    before reckitt can re-label and stock shelves with its dettol disinfecting sprays and lysol toilet cleaners, it must complete a battery of regulator-mandated tests that typically take at least six months. it could take over a year if they need to create entirely new coronavirus-killing products.    reckitt\u2019s move, which reuters could not independently verify, could put some of its rivals on the back foot.    at stake are potentially billions of dollars in sales. consumers spent nearly $22 billion on surface cleaners globally and another $1.43 billion on cleaning wipes in 2019. clorox has about 4% percent and 37% percent of the surface cleaner and disinfecting wipes categories, respectively, followed by reckitt, with share of 7.3% and 17.2%.    during public health emergencies, such as 'bird flu,' the h1n1 pandemic in 2009 and the 2013 mers crisis, demand for surface cleaners and disinfecting wipes typically spikes, a reuters analysis of euromonitor data \nshows.       'rushing around'    reynen, who held several top research roles in his 24 years at p&g, said companies can spend a few thousand dollars to buy aggressive virus strains like the novel coronavirus from regulator-approved microbiology laboratories, which mail the samples with a glycerin solution in small, deep-frozen vessels.    \u201cprocter and clorox will be rushing around to get a strain,\u201d he said. \u201cif they don't have it in their labs by now, i'd expect they will in the next week or two.\u201d    p&g, clorox and unilever declined to comment on whether they\u2019re pursuing or have managed to get samples of the novel coronavirus.    the companies likely do not have labs sophisticated enough to complete the rigorous six-month testing for a virus as nasty as this, so they outsource most of the work to external labs approved by regulators, a process that could cost about $100,000-$200,000, reynen said. the contracted labs typically work with top biomedical research organizations such as the private non-profit institut pasteur in paris and the german government agency robert koch-institut in berlin.    as deaths and illnesses from the novel coronavirus mount, companies are resorting to the most powerful claims they can make. the u.s. epa and european chemicals agency do allow for certain carefully-worded statements even in the absence of testing against a strain of the novel coronavirus.    for example, lysol, p&g and clorox recently created websites promoting awareness, claiming some of their disinfectant products \"demonstrated effectiveness against viruses similar to 2019 novel coronavirus\" and \"can be used\" against coronavirus on certain surfaces. p&g also put out a new line of sanitizing products called microban 24 in late february with tv ads touting they were better than rival lysol, but the company said the launch was not connected to the coronavirus outbreak.    retail sales for lysol wipes and rival clorox wipes rose 184% in the week ended feb. 29 versus last year, according to data firm bloomreach. at the same time, shares of reckitt, p&g and clorox have outperformed the broader market, which has plunged since the first case of coronavirus was detected in china on dec. 31. reuters ", "label": 1}, {"content": "china says virus spreading between humans as who set to meet. china has confirmed cases of human-to-human transmission in the outbreak of a new sars-like virus as the number of cases soared and the world health organisation (who) said it would consider declaring an international public health emergency.\nthe coronavirus, which has spread to three other asian countries and infected more than 200 people in china, has caused alarm because it of its genetic similarities to severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland china and hong kong in 2002-2003.\nthe discovery of human-to-human transmission comes as hundreds of millions of people are criss-crossing the country in packed trains, buses and planes this week to celebrate the lunar new year with relatives.\nhealth authorities in the central city of wuhan, where a seafood market has been identified as the centre of the outbreak, on tuesday said that an 89-year-old man became the fourth person to die from the virus and that 15 medical staff had been infected.\na second case was also confirmed in shanghai on tuesday while five people have been diagnosed with the virus in beijing.\nread | who to hold emergency meeting as sars-like virus spreads in asia\nzhong nanshan, a renowned scientist at the national health commission, confirmed that the virus was being transmitted between humans, state media reported late monday.\nthe who had previously identified animals as the likely primary source, but had warned of \"some limited human-to-human transmission\".\nzhong told cctv that patients can contract the virus without having visited wuhan.\nhe also said 14 medical staff had been infected but it was not clear if he was referring to the wuhan cases.\nin southern guangdong province, two patients were infected by family members who visited wuhan, he told cctv.\nmust read | china is fighting to stop the spread of a mysterious, deadly virus\nthe who said a key emergency committee would meet wednesday to determine whether to declare an international public health emergency.\nthe agency has only used the rare label a handful of times, including during the h1n1 -

located just one block away from the seafood market where the deadly covid-19 outbreak is suspected to have originated, even though the local government acknowledged only one death from the virus.   as of last thursday (feb 20), 11 seniors died from respiratory failure after recurrent fevers, a nurse at wuhan social welfare institute told caixin. she said the facility's infirmary didn't have covid-19 testing capability and many medical workers have had fever symptoms.   the facility recently arranged chest ct scans at a nearby hospital for residents and staff. a scan report the nurse showed a caixin reporter states that the patient has multiple patchy ground-glass shadows in the lungs, similar to many confirmed covid-19 cases.   unexplained deaths from lung ailments among the elderly at the wuhan social welfare institute and similar facilities suggest that nursing homes may be another blind spot as the government's epidemic-fighting efforts have focused on hospitals and other communities.   last week it came to light that chinese prisons reported more than 500 previously uncounted covid-19 cases among guards and inmates.   at least two other nursing homes in wuhan also recorded deaths either possibly from the virus or confirmed cases. a family member of an 85-year-old resident at gu tian rong ji nursing centre told caixin that his mother died at the nursing home and the family suspected she was infected by a care worker. the head of the nursing home acknowledged that one of the caregivers was confirmed with the coronavirus but denied that the deceased resident was infected by the worker.   another community senior care centre with about 40 residents also found eight tested positive for the virus. the rest of the residents and staff are quarantined at the centre and no visitors are allowed, a community worker said.   the wuhan civil affairs bureau disputed the report about the wuhan social welfare institute friday night through the government's official wechat account, saying the facility checked its residents and staff and found that 11 seniors tested positive for the virus and one of them died while being transferred to a hospital.   according to the government response, the welfare facility started testing residents and staff on feb 11, although caixin learnt from sources that multiple seniors died between late december and feb 19 after showing virus symptoms such as fever, breathing difficulty and loss of appetite.   after wuhan tightened quarantine measures to restrict people from leaving their homes and to send the sick into makeshift quarantine quarters, many people lost contact with elderly family members in nursing homes. family members of people in nursing homes say they have been trying to find out how many residents may be infected, where the elderly are quarantined, \nwhether there are caregivers, what test results show and whether the government can send more medical and care staff to institutions.   a list of the dead at the social welfare facility obtained by caixin showed 15 fatalities between dec 23 and feb 11 and four more on feb 18. of the total of 19 fatalities, only the death of an 83-year-old male on feb 15 was clearly linked to covid-19. eight others were attributed to infections, including six to lung infections and two deaths from shock caused by infection. the remaining 10 fatalities were reportedly from other causes, and five of them took place before feb 11 when the nursing home started testing for covid-19.   the nursing home has never before had so many deaths in such a short time, according to a staff member who has worked there many years. except for one 27-year-old female with cholecystitis, all of the 18 others on the fatalities list were in their 80s and 90s and most had diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke or disabilities, according to the list.   the facility, just a few hundred yards from the seafood market that may have been the starting point of the outbreak, is a combination senior hospital and nursing home. it is home to 458 senior residents with 190 staff, 21 property management personnel and eight care workers. the facility has been sealed off since jan 21 as local authorities stepped up efforts to contain the outbreak. all staff have been asked to stay in the facility.   a doctor in the welfare facility's infirmary said he participated in the treatment of a patient in late december who had a fever as high as 107.6 degrees fahrenheit (42 deg c). the patient died from septic shock possibly caused by infection, but the cause of infection was unknown because no virus check was done, according to the doctor, who was later confirmed infected with covid-19 himself.   the doctor said he treated three seniors who died since late december. several doctors, nurses and attendants have also shown symptoms of lung infection, the doctor said.   a care worker said more than 10 seniors died during the chinese new year holiday. at first, they had fever and lost appetite. those with recurrent fevers were transferred to quarantine rooms but died after a couple of days, the worker said.   \"since they were never confirmed with tests, we don't know whether they died from the virus,\" the worker said. \"but before the outbreak, even though many of the seniors at the nursing home have chronic diseases, we have never seen so many deaths in such a short time.\"   a family member with the last name zhu said he was told his 92-year-old father died from a heart attack on feb 11 in the infirmary. the nursing home called the son on feb 9, telling him to take his father to a hospital because he had a fever of 103 degrees fahrenheit (40 deg c). as the son had a fever himself and his community was locked down, he couldn't come to the nursing home.   some family members of deceased seniors told caixin that the \nnursing home didn't take sufficient protective measures and residents were not even asked to wear masks.   the doctor at the infirmary said the nursing home wasn't sealed off until jan 21, when the outbreak was already spreading quickly in the city. because it was close to the chinese new year, there were many visitors at the nursing home every day. it hasn't been ruled out that visiting family members might have brought the virus into the nursing home, the doctor said.   a medical worker at the nursing home said it's also difficult to implement quarantine measures because of staff shortages and residents with dementia.   hubei vice-governor wan yong emphasised on saturday in a video conference that nursing homes face severe situations as the elderly are at high risk of infection. the wuhan civil affairs bureau said on friday that it aimed to finish screening tests on every person in nursing facilities that have found confirmed or suspected vases by saturday and will finish tests in all other nursing facilities by feb 28.   bao zhiming, xiao hui, gao yu contributed to this

", "label": 1}, {"content": "surfaces? sneezes? sex? how coronavirus can and cannot spread. new york \u2014 a delicate but highly contagious virus, around 900 times smaller than the width of a human hair, is spreading from person to person around the world. the coronavirus, as it\u2019s known, has already infected people in at least 60 countries.   because this virus is so new, experts\u2019 understanding of how it spreads is limited. they can, however, offer some guidance about how it does \u2014 and does not \u2014 seem to be transmitted.   if i cross paths with a sick person, will i get sick, too?   you walk into a crowded grocery store. a shopper has coronavirus. what puts you most at risk of getting infected by that person?   experts agree they have a great deal to learn, but four factors likely play some role: how close you get; how long you are near the person; whether that person projects viral droplets on you; and how much you touch your face. (of course, your age and health are also major factors.)   what\u2019s a viral droplet?   it is a droplet containing viral particles. a virus is a tiny codependent microbe that attaches to a cell, takes over, makes more of itself and moves on to its next host. this is its \u201clifestyle,\u201d said dr gary whittaker, a professor of virology at cornell university college of veterinary medicine.   a \u201cnaked\u201d virus can\u2019t go anywhere unless it\u2019s hitching a ride with a droplet of mucus or saliva, said dr kin-on kwok, a professor at the chinese university of hong kong\u2019s jockey club school of public health and primary care.   these mucus and saliva droplets are ejected from the mouth or nose as we cough, sneeze, laugh, sing, breathe and talk. if they don\u2019t hit something along the way, they typically land on the floor or ground.   to get access to your cells, the viral droplets must enter through the eyes, nose or mouth. some experts believe that sneezing and coughing are likely the primary forms of transmission. dr kwok said talking face to face or sharing a meal with someone could pose a risk.   dr julian tang, a virologist and professor at the university of leicester in england who is researching coronavirus with dr kwok, agreed.   \u201cif you can smell what someone had for lunch \u2014 garlic, curry, etc. \u2014 you are inhaling what they are breathing out, including any virus in their breath,\u201d he said.   how close is too close?   mr christian lindmeier, a spokesman for the world health organization (who), said it\u2019s best to stay 3 feet from a sick person.   the centers for disease control and prevention said that standing within 6 feet (about one metre) could carry risk.   how long is too long to be near an infected person?   it\u2019s not yet clear, but most experts agree that more time equals more risk.   will you know a person is sick?   not necessarily.   keep in mind that if you do get sick, most symptoms are as mild as a cold or the flu. still, others who are infected with coronavirus never fall ill at all. (technically, covid-19 is the name for the sickness caused by the \nrespiratory virus.)   but the flip side of this is that it can be hard to tell who is capable of spreading coronavirus.   in a growing number of cases, people without symptoms have infected others. the who still believes that most of those who have spread coronavirus were clearly ill at the time of transmission, mr lindmeier said.   can the virus last on a bus pole, touch screen or other surface?   yes. after numerous people who attended a buddhist temple in hong kong fell ill, the city\u2019s centre for health protection collected samples from the site. restroom faucets and the cloth covers over buddhist texts tested positive for coronavirus, the agency said.   technically, the virus widely known as the coronavirus is just the latest of many similarly shaped viruses. (coronaviruses are named for the spikes that protrude from their surfaces, which resemble a crown or the sun\u2019s corona.) a study of other coronaviruses found they remained on metal, glass and plastic for two hours to nine days.   whether a surface looks dirty or clean is irrelevant. if an infected person sneezed and a droplet landed on a surface, a person who then touches that surface could pick it up. how much is required to infect a person is unclear.   coronaviruses are relatively easy to destroy, dr whittaker said. using a simple disinfectant on a surface is nearly guaranteed to break the delicate envelope that surrounds the tiny microbe, rendering it harmless.   as long as you wash your hands before touching your face, you should be ok, because viral droplets don\u2019t pass through skin.   if you are concerned about getting sick from someone who might have sneezed onto a product you\u2019ve ordered that\u2019s made in china, don\u2019t worry. in the time it takes to get to the united states, you should be safe, and if you are really concerned, you can clean the surface with a disinfectant or wash your hands after touching it.   does the brand or type of soap you use matter?   no, several experts said.   my neighbour is coughing. should i be worried?   there is no evidence that viral particles can go through walls or glass, said dr ashish k. jha, director of the harvard global health institute.   he said he was more concerned about common spaces than dangers posed by vents, provided there is good air circulation in a room.   an infected neighbour might sneeze on a railing and if you touched it, \u201cthat would be a more natural way to get it from your neighbour,\u201d he said.   can i get it from making out with someone?   kissing would definitely spread it, several experts said.   though coronaviruses are not typically sexually transmitted, it\u2019s too soon to know, the who said.   is it safe to eat where people are sick with coronavirus?   if a sick person handles the food or it\u2019s a high-traffic buffet, then risks cannot be ruled out \u2014 but heating or reheating food should kill the virus, dr whittaker said.   dr jha concurred.   \u201cas a general rule, we haven\u2019t seen that food is a mechanism for spreading,\u201d he said. \ncan my dog or cat safely join me in quarantine?   thousands of people have already begun various types of quarantines. some have been mandated by health officials, and others are voluntary and primarily involve staying home.   dr whittaker, who has studied the spread of coronaviruses in animals and humans, said he\u2019s seen no evidence that a person could be a danger to their pet. the new york times ", "label": 1}, {"content": "china's fuzhou port restricts ships from virus-hit nations including singapore for 14 days: report. beijing (bloomberg) - the port of fuzhou in eastern china is restricting vessels arriving from nine countries including the us and singapore in an effort to limit the spread of the coronavirus by visiting ships and their crew. \n vessels arriving from japan, south korea, iran, france, germany, spain, italy, the us, and singapore won't be allowed entry into the port until they've completed a mandatory 14-day quarantine, said people with knowledge of the terminal's decision. \n the countdown begins when ships depart from those nations, said the people, asking not to be identified because they're not authorised to speak publicly. \n nobody answered calls to fuzhou's port office. it is the world's 47th busiest port, handling 3.3 million twenty-foot equivalent units in 2018, according to the world shipping council. \n the mandatory quarantine will particularly hit cargoes from asian countries that typically take a week or less to sail to china. it will also raise fears of similar steps by much bigger ports in the world's second-biggest economy, notably the major cargo hubs of guangzhou, shanghai and tianjin that serve the country's biggest coastal populations. \n fuzhou's measures follow similar steps taken by other countries as the virus spread. in february, australia's maritime safety body intensified checks on incoming foreign vessels while kuwait prohibited all its ports from receiving foreign ships arriving from or departing to some coronavirus-hit nations, with the exception of vessels shipping hydrocarbons. \n a spokesman from japanese shipowner mitsui osk lines ltd said the company was aware of chinese restrictions on vessels sailing from high-risk countries with large numbers of coronavirus infections, without confirming if japan was one of those countries.

seen very strange pneumonia, very severe, particularly in old people in december and even november,\" dr giuseppe remuzzi, the director of the mario negri institute for pharmacological research in

of this outbreak occurring in china.\" \n dr remuzzi's comments came as scientists continue to search for the origin of the coronavirus. chinese respiratory disease expert zhong nanshan said earlier that although china was the first to report the pathogen, it was not yet certain where it actually came from. \n dr remuzzi said it was only recently that he had heard from italian doctors about the disease, which meant it had existed and been spreading without people's knowledge. \n despite reporting its first locally transmitted coronavirus infections in lombardy only on february 21\u00a0\u2014

morning post said that the first chinese case might have been as early as mid-november, but that has not been confirmed by beijing. \n the current thinking among the scientific community is that the

stem cell therapy to treat severe cases. beijing (xinhua) - chinese researchers are studying the use of stem cell technology in the treatment of people critically ill with the coronavirus, the science

the therapy will be further expanded, vice-minister of science and technology xu nanping, was cited by the paper as saying. \n stem cells can self-renew or multiply while maintaining the potential to develop into other types of cells. they can become cells of the blood, heart, lungs or other body parts. \n stem cells also have a strong secretory function, promoting the formation of new blood vessels, cell proliferation and differentiation, and inhibiting inflammatory response, experts say. \n stem cell therapy has also been used in treating h7n9 avian flu and showed good results. \n

over-activated by the infection. \n that will damage the lungs and impair breathing. some severe patients may have respiratory failure. \n \"lung inflammation and injury are the focus of the treatment of severe patients,\" prof zuo said. \n the damage to lung tissue can be fatal, and stem cell therapy is expected to help repair the damage, prof zuo added. \n currently, three kinds of stem cells - mesenchymal, lung and embryonic stem cells - are used in treatments. researchers usually inject stem cell products into the lungs. \n stem cells can improve the immune microenvironment in the lungs and reduce the risk of pulmonary failure caused by inflammation. \n stem cells have the potential of self-renewal and differentiation, and can develop into corresponding functional cells and alveoli, and then repair the damaged tissue, prof zuo said. \n however, the wider use of stem cell technology to treat covid-19 is still some time away. \n the safety and effectiveness of a new drug or therapy

the new coronavirus outbreak promised it was of no danger to his country. \"quarantines belong to the stone age,\" iraj harirchi insisted. a day later, he himself would be in quarantine from the virus. harirchi's story is a microcosm of what has happened in iran amid the coronavirus pandemic. roughly nine out of 10 cases in the middle east come from the islamic republic, which has reported nearly 15,000 people infected and at least 853 deaths amid fears that cases may still be underreported. while most people who are infected recover, the virus spreads rapidly and can kill the elderly and those with breathing problems or other underlying illnesses. days of denials gave the virus time to spread in iran as the country marked the 41st anniversary of its 1979 islamic revolution with mass demonstrations and then held a parliamentary election in which authorities desperately sought to boost turnout. although iran has one of the mideast's best medical services, its hospitals appear to be overwhelmed and authorities have asked for 172 million masks from abroad. it also has asked the international monetary fund for $5 billion, the first such loan for iran since 1962. the islamic republic has an opportunity to limit the virus as the persian new year, nowruz, approaches. but authorities appear unable or unwilling to stop travel between major cities as local towns affected by the virus threaten to set up their own checkpoints to turn away or even attack outsiders. that's in sharp contrast to iraq and lebanon, iranian allies that have restricted movement while facing a fraction of the reported infections. what happens next will not only affect iran's civilian government and shiite theocracy, whose officials already have fallen ill, but also the wider world.

'patient zero' and an election in a country like iran, where the state controls all broadcasters and journalists face restrictions, many things about the outbreak remain unknown. chief among them is who was \"patient zero\" - the person who was first infected with the coronavirus in the nation, and where. public comments point to the city of qom, 125 kilometers (80 miles) southwest of tehran, on the country's windswept central desert plateau. how the virus arrived there remains in question. authorities suggested that perhaps an iranian businessman returned from china with the virus. qom is home to major shiite seminaries that draw chinese students. it also is along a $2.7 billion high-speed train route that a chinese company is building, a sign of china's outreach to tehran amid \ncrushing us sanctions. china is also constructing a solar power plant there. from late january, worries could be seen on the front page of the pro-reform newspaper aftab-e yazd. \"mysterious virus at iran's gates,\" its banner headline warned as china began a lockdown to control the outbreak. yet travel between china and iran continued. the first two coronavirus cases were reported feb. 19, with the announcement that both died in qom. since it can take up to two weeks to show symptoms, they could have gotten it in early february. iranian authorities haven't offered any details. iran analysts suggest it might be because the country marked the 41st anniversary of the islamic revolution during that period. iran also held parliamentary elections feb. 21. the government desperately wanted a large turnout to boost its legitimacy after shooting down a ukrainian passenger jet, killing all 176 people on board. days earlier, a us drone strike in baghdad killed top revolutionary guard gen. qassem soleimani, further shaking its credibility. iranian authorities already had disqualified thousands of candidates from running, ultimately tilting the election to conservatives. supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei even later accused foreign enemies of trying to influence turnout with the outbreak. \"the pretext of an illness and virus was used, and their media did not miss the slightest opportunity to discourage people from voting,\" he said. the election saw iran's lowest turnout since the revolution, with some voters wearing the masks that everyone soon would want. but people already were dying and fear was spreading. shrines and hazmat suits qom long has been the stronghold of iran's shiite clergy. a focal point of devotion is the golden-domed shrine of fatima masumeh, a shiite saint. crowds pray there 24 hours a day, seven days a week, touching and kissing the shrine. that raises the risks for visitors. in saudi arabia, authorities have closed off access to the holiest sites in islam over concerns about the virus. churches, mosques, temples and shrines around the world have been closed or subject to stringent disinfecting campaigns. but in qom and elsewhere in iran, the shrines stayed open despite civilian health authorities demanding they close. mohammad saidi, who oversees the fatima masumeh shrine, insinuated that closing shrines was part of a plot against shiites by president donald trump. \"defeating qom is the dream of treacherous trump and his domestic mercenaries, but this dream will not be realized even in their grave,\" saidi said on feb. 22. that decision likely gave the virus time to spread. police later arrested those who posted online video of themselves licking and kissing shrines. \"the city's religious epithet - 'the nest of the prophet and his family' - was intended to reassure believers worldwide that it was insulated against epidemics and other disasters,\" wrote mehdi khalaji, a qom-trained shiite theologian who is an analyst at the washington \ninstitute for near-east policy. \"if early reports about the spread of the coronavirus prove correct, qom's status as the ideological capital of the islamic revolution helped make it the pathogen's transmitting center to the rest of iran and at least seven other countries.\" since then, hazmat-suited workers have fogged disinfectant and cleaned the shrines. some mosques even hand out alcohol as a disinfectant to the poor despite islam forbidding its consumption. by monday night, the fatima masumeh shrine and another one in mashhad had closed, only to see online videos purport to show hard-line faithful storming the shrines' courtyard, demanding they open. but by that point, the virus had spread, reaching the highest levels of iran's theocracy. 'the situation is terrible here and i hope god helps us' like blood from a beating heart, the infections in qom coursed out across iran in maps later shared by the health ministry. in tehran, the virus began moving through the government and the shiite theocracy. among those first infected was harirchi, the deputy health minister who tested positive only a day after he downplayed the virus in a televised news conference. it didn't stop there. the virus killed expediency council member mohammad mirmohammadi, described as a close confidant of khamenei. hadi khosroshahi, iran's former ambassador to the vatican, and ahmad tuyserkani, an adviser to iran's judiciary chief, also died along with several lawmakers and a member of the country's assembly of experts. the sick included vice president masoumeh ebtekar, better known as \"sister mary,\" the english-speaking spokeswoman for the students who seized the u.s. embassy in tehran in 1979 in the 444-day hostage crisis. the virus also infected senior vice president eshaq jahangiri and two other cabinet members, along with revolutionary guard members and doctors. soon, even 80-year-old khamenei was seen wearing disposable gloves at a tree-planting ceremony. president hassan rouhani, 71, was pictured at a teleconference with the nearest official a few meters (several feet) away. the numbers soared. iran's death rate from the virus now is higher than in other hard-hit nations. that could be from the initial lack of testing kits and facilities. it also could be from what outside experts, tehran lawmakers and other local leaders have alleged from the start: iran was hiding the true number of infections and deaths. authorities initially denied that, especially after the bbc's persian service said deaths far exceeded those reported at the beginning of the crisis. but that denial appeared to weaken over time. \"we found out a little late that the coronavirus had entered iran because we mistook it for the flu,\" reza malekzadeh, a deputy health minister, later said. a man in qom filmed rows of bodies in black bags and caskets awaiting burial for days in a trench lined with lime. he alleged all had tested positive for the coronavirus, although officials later said the bodies had \nbeen held pending test results. \"the situation is terrible here and i hope god helps us,\" he said while walking through the mortuary. authorities later arrested him. past experiences, new worries diseases have influenced iranian history. cholera outbreaks plagued its qajar dynasty, long indebted to british and russian powers. the chaos and debt set the stage for iran's 1906 constitutional revolution and the creation of parliament. that cholera outbreak saw shiite religious leaders lash out at the west. now, iranian leaders, such as the head of its revolutionary guard and khamenei himself, traffic in the baseless conspiracy theory that the coronavirus is a biological weapon created by the u.s., something echoed by chinese officials as well. \"the psychology of the leadership in iran has sort of an almost self-destructive need to double down on a lie just to sort of portray itself as competent,\" afkhami said. that's contrasted with the response to the el tor strain of cholera that caused a pandemic through the 1960s. iran produced millions of vaccine doses and inoculated its people, controlling its spread. it even gave broad-range antibiotics from the u.s. to pilgrims visiting shiite shrines, afkhami said. \"this rapid mobilization and this rapid response allowed the country to control the epidemic,\" he said. that was under iran's shah, toppled in the 1979 revolution. but even after, iran fought off other outbreaks, and its hospitals, doctors and nurses are known as some of the best in the wider middle east, with a network of clinics from villages to big cities. however, the system appears to be stretching at the seams, with online videos purporting to show field hospitals going up. meanwhile, iran's 80 million people, whose sense of high risk has been dulled by years of international isolation, crowd into grocery stores and butcher shops, suspicious of anything in the state media. nowruz, the persian new year, looms on friday, a holiday when millions travel. the government repeatedly has stopped short of ordering any major travel restrictions. it hasn't explained why, but there could be worry about further angering its people or slowing down its anemic, sanctions-hurt economy. online videos show iranians ignoring government demands to stay home and moving instead toward the coast of the caspian sea and the persian gulf. residents of hard-hit rasht, on iran's coast, have threatened to attack out-of-towners. \"we expect that, god willing, we can contain the rising trend of the disease, not the disease itself, by march 26,\" said harirchi, the health official who is recovering from covid-19. \"but i say this very frankly: if the great people don't cooperate, the disease will continue to be there until late may or even in june, and turn into a huge crisis.\" and the man who once called quarantines a thing of the past added: \"i beg the people to minimize their trips and contacts, and isolate the infected people from others completely.\" ", "label": 1}, {"content": "u.s. could be next 'virus epicenter' as india locks down, global

Thus, the Chinese authorities announced the strongest increase in infections and deaths within a day so far. Meanwhile, there are 17,205 confirmed cases - 2,829 more than the day before. The number of deaths rose 361 in China. The first death outside of China was on the weekend in the Philippines. It was a smart Chinese from Wuhan. In the meantime, the authorities expect the highlight of the disease later than expected. \"We assume that the highlight of the epidemic is expected in ten days to two weeks,\" said the boss of the National Virusxpertenteam, Zhong Nanshan. He corrected his prediction of a week ago when he had predicted the climax for the end of this week. He estimated the mortality rate at 2.4 to 2.5 percent. At the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities of the World Health Organization WHO reported an accumulation of pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause in the Central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the diseases. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days then a group released a group of the virologen Christian's premier from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 the first diagnostic test for the new virus, the researcher provisionally call 2019-NCOV. With the test, the virus can be detected in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, on which, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected. Both the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as well as Mers (MIDDLE East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses which have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more than 750 died. With the MERS virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronaviruses. Many of them relate to respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example. In China, several thousand persons are suffering from them, some of them - most of them with pre-existing conditions - have died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first infection cases outside of China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been in Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection with a tourist, who came back from Wuhan, on January 24, the first cases were known in France. Meanwhile, first cases were confirmed in Germany. Typical signs of an infection are \nFever, cough and breathing difficulties. The virus can cause pneumonia that can endally end. Since it is a viral illness, antibiotics do not help. Meanwhile, it is clear that the virus can be transferred from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transfers after a dozen cases were known in medical staff. Medizors assume that the virus is transmitted above all over droplet infection. The World Health Organization calculates, as announced on January 24, at the moment that an infected one cuts 1.4 to 2.5 other people. Contest these numbers, the virus is less contagious than SARS and also the viral flu. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals. That can not be said yet. The World Health Organization said on 28 January that about one-fifth of the reported cases through the virus will be seriously ill, so in case of doubt must be treated intensive care. According to reports, the first death pots were patients who had some severe pre-existing conditions. Even with other infectious diseases, people with pre-existing diseases are particularly endangered - for example at the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so change their genome. This can cause you to become more dangerous for people in the course of an outbreak - but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) expects no similar mortality to the current time as the outbreak of SARS. The Coronavirus named 2019-NCOV opened for the first time in December on a market in Wuhan. Diseased suffering from coughing, fever, breathing difficulties, to a pneumonia. The authorities are trying to curb the disease with drastic measures. In the crisis region in Central China, 45 million people were chamfered in several cities. Overland compounds with buses were exposed, flights and trains reduced. The metropolis Wenzhou - more than 800 kilometers east of Wuhan - practically imposed an outgoing lock for the nine million inhabitants. Each family may only choose a member that can go out every two days for shopping. There are also infections worldwide. So far, 180 diseases were confirmed in about two dozen countries. In Germany, the virus has been proven to ten people so far. Two of these patients belonged to the more than a hundred people who had been retained on Saturday with a special flight from Wuhan. The two patients are well assessed by the doctors. \"They are currently being cared for inpurately insulated and are medically well,\" said the medical director of the Universitylinikum Frankfurt, \nJ\u00fcrgen Graf. The head of the Frankfurt health office, Ren\u00e9 Gottschalk, meanwhile warned against panicmaking: \"I am clearly scared before the flu - from the point of view of health authorities - as before this virus. After all, what we know, the course in Europe is very mild.\" At the same time, rumors and misinformation on the infectious disease, which showed the World Health Organization (WHO) worried. The outbreak of the Ecorer 2019-NCOV was accompanied by a \"massive info\", a flood of information was accompanied by the WHO. Some information is correct, but many not. People could hardly distinguish between myths and facts. The WHO therefore launched its own website and an information campaign on Facebook, Twitter and other social media. It also works on questions about how: can help the food of garlic against the coronavirus. Answer: There is no document for that. Even the smoke of fireworks - another circulating misinformation - do not help with the pathogen. The acceptance of letters or parcels from China is harmless. The virus does not survive long on such objects. On their website, the health organization advises, among other things, for regular hand washing, even if the hands are \"not visible dirty\".

consumption of raw and undercooked meats   avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness   observe good personal hygiene   practise frequent hand-washing with soap, for example, before handling food or eating, after going to the toilet, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing   wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or runny nose   cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and dispose of the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately   seek medical attention promptly if

The procedures needed for the repatriation of these people, who are well-known (according to the ambassador), have already started, although they do not know when they are will be taken from the country and if they are going to be taken to Istanbul or Ankara. Right is that they will be kept quarantined for a while, the ambassador said. Also South Korea announced that you will send this Thursday planes to withdraw your about 700 citizens of the Chinese city. Only those who did not present symptoms of infection may board, said the Deputy Minister of South Korean Health, Kim Gang-Lip, and will then be installed in two centers made available by the Government in the province of Chungcheong for 14 days. However, the Italian government announced that it will begin to repatriate, this week, its citizens. In a Twitter publication, the Italian Foreign Minister Luigi di May, he said that he will be sent tomorrow, Thursday, a plane to Wuhan, finding the Italian Government \"fully committed to supporting their compatriots China\". \"As soon as the requests made to the Chinese Government, Italian citizens shall be transported to the \nWuhan airport with specialized doctors, nurses and all necessary equipment to ensure a safe trip. \" And as soon as he arrived in Italy, he also clarified the minister, \"a health protocol defined by the Ministry of Health of the Country will be fulfilled.\" In the case of Portugal, Community source told the Express that can be more than 10, but that the final number is not yet closed. In addition, it stressed that it is not the European Commission that is organizing the distribution of places. The operation is French and Brussels only enters with part of the financing - assumes 75% of the costs of the repatriation trip. The same source clarifies that it is a \"Standard Consular Procedure\" (Standard Consular Procedure, in Free Translation): They must be the Portuguese authorities - or the citizens who are in Wuhan - to speak directly to the French authorities to ensure place in the travel. Already government sources secured the \"public\" which are 15 Portuguese interested in returning to Portugal and can do it on Friday. Repatriation must be made in the second flight organized under the European Civil Protection Mechanism of the European Union (EU), where they should also travel Spanish and Germans. In a press conference in Brussels, the European Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenarcic, indicated that \"so far, a total of nearly 600 EU citizens have expressed their desire to leave China\" in repatriation actions. Without needing how many citizens of each country are concerned, Janez Lenarcic said only that it is nationals of Germany, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Spain, Finland, France, Italy, Latvia, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania and United Kingdom . Commissioner Janez Lenarcic noted that \"the French authorities are already in contact with the Chinese authorities because of the issue of flights,\" explaining that these repatriation actions are \"complex and require time.\" Another of the measures in the meantime was the suspension of air connections to China, having several countries already taken this initiative. This is the case of British Airways, which was suspended all flights from and to Continental China (and the British that return from Wuhan will be karanted for 14 days, according to the United Kingdom Health Minister) and Russian airline Ural Airlines, which operates to Munich, Paris and Rome and also announced the suspension of all flights to Europe. \"Due to the epidemic situation in China and with the implementation of restrictive measures by the Chinese authorities and the Russian tourism agency intended for Chinese and Russian tourists, Ural Airlines is forced to cancel a series of flights until the end of the winter.\" According to Ural Airlines, headquartered in Ecaterinburgh, in the Urals, the Company's flights to Europe are \"traditionally frequented by large groups of organized excursions from China.\" In India no suspension of flights was announced or withdrawn from citizens, \nBut the government asked the population not to travel to China if there is no need for this. At the beginning of Wednesday afternoon, Lufthansa also - the largest German airline - announced the suspension of all flights from and to China. In the case of Portugal, and questioned about the subject by the express, TAP source clarified that although the airline does not fly directly to China (only partial flights), \"is naturally attentive to the situation and to accompany its developments, In line with all recommendations and decisions of competent authorities in these matters, national and international \".

novel virus has largely spared one vulnerable group \u2014 children \u2014 it appears to pose a particular threat to middle-aged and older adults, particularly men.   this week, the chinese centre for disease control and prevention published the largest analysis of coronavirus cases to date. although men and women have been infected in roughly equal numbers, researchers found, the death rate among men was 2.8 per cent, compared with 1.7 per cent among women.   men also were disproportionately affected during the sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and mers (middle east respiratory syndrome) outbreaks, which were caused by coronaviruses. more women than men were infected by sars in hong kong in 2003, but the death rate among men was 50 per cent higher, according to a study published in the annals of internal medicine.   some 32 per cent of men infected with mers, compared with 25.8 per cent of women. young adult men also died at higher rates than female peers during the influenza epidemic of 1918.   a number of factors may be working against men in the current epidemic, scientists say, including some that are biological, and some that are rooted in lifestyle.   when it comes to mounting an immune response against infections, men are the weaker sex.   \u201cthis is a pattern we\u2019ve seen with many viral infections of the respiratory tract \u2014 men can have worse outcomes,\u201d said dr sabra klein, a scientist who studies sex differences in viral infections and vaccination responses at the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health.   \u201cwe\u2019ve seen this with other viruses. women fight them off better,\u201d she added.   women also produce stronger immune responses after vaccinations, and have enhanced memory immune responses, which protect adults from pathogens they were exposed to as children.   \u201cthere\u2019s something about the immune system in females that is more exuberant,\u201d said dr janine clayton, director of the office of research on women\u2019s health at the national institutes of health.   but there\u2019s a high price, she added: women are far more susceptible to autoimmune diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, in which the immune system shifts into overdrive and attacks the body\u2019s own organs and tissues.   nearly 80 per cent of those with autoimmune diseases are women, dr clayton noted.   the reasons women have stronger immune responses aren\u2019t entirely clear, and the research is still at an early stage, experts caution.   one hypothesis is that women\u2019s stronger immune systems confer a survival advantage to their offspring, who imbibe antibodies from mothers\u2019 breast milk that help ward off disease while the infants\u2019 immune systems are still developing.   a stew of biological factors may be responsible, including the female sex hormone estrogen, which appears to play a role in immunity, and the fact that \nwomen carry two x chromosomes, which contain immune-related genes. men, of course, carry only one.   experiments in which mice were exposed to the sars coronavirus found that the males were more susceptible to infection than the females, a disparity that increased with age.   the male mice developed sars at lower viral exposures, had a lower immune response and were slower to clear the virus from their bodies. they suffered more lung damage, and died at higher rates, said dr stanley perlman, a professor of microbiology at the university of iowa who was the senior author of the study.   when researchers blocked estrogen in the infected females or removed their ovaries, they were more likely to die, but blocking testosterone in male mice made no difference, indicating that estrogen may play a protective role.   \u201cit\u2019s an exaggerated model of what happens in humans,\u201d dr perlman said. \u201cthe differences between men and women are subtle \u2014 in mice, it\u2019s not so subtle.\u201d   health behaviours that differ by sex in some societies may also play a role in disparate responses to infections.   china has the largest population of smokers in the world \u2014 316 million people \u2014 accounting for nearly one-third of the world\u2019s smokers and 40 per cent of tobacco consumption worldwide. but just more than 2 per cent of chinese women smoke, compared with more than half of all men.   chinese men also have higher rates of type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure than women, both of which increase the risk of complications following infection with the coronavirus. rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are almost twice as high among chinese men as among women.   in the united states, women are more proactive about seeking health care than men, and some small studies have found the generalisation applies to chinese students at universities in the united states, as well.   in unpublished studies, chinese researchers have emphasised that patients whose diagnoses were delayed, or who had severe pneumonia when they were first diagnosed, were at greatest risk of dying.   one study of 4,021 patients with the coronavirus emphasised the importance of early detection, particularly in older men. and men have been turning up in hospitals with more advanced disease.   but in areas of china outside hubei province, the epidemic\u2019s epicentre and where the majority of those affected are concentrated, the patterns are different: the illness appears to have dramatically lower mortality rates, and men are being infected at much higher rates than women, according to the chinese cdc analysis.   men may have a \u201cfalse sense of security\u201d when it comes to the coronavirus, said dr akiko iwasaki, a professor of immunology at yale university who studies why some viruses affect women more severely.   gathering and analysing data about the new virus by sex is important both for the scientists studying it and for the general public, experts said.   since the start of the outbreak, for example, public \nhealth officials have emphasised the importance of washing hands well and often, to prevent infection. but several studies have found that men \u2014 even health care workers \u2014 are less likely to wash their hands or to use soap than women, dr klein said.   \u201cwe make these broad sweeping assumptions that men and women are the same behaviourally, in terms of comorbidities, biology and our immune system, and we just are not,\u201d dr klein said. the new york times ", "label": 1}, {"content": "US advise against

", "label": 0}, {"content": "The panic came overnight. The Coronavirus has long since reached the financial markets. Rarely started at Wall Street a week with such a great uncertainty. Do the coming days bring a recovery of the courses or is everything even worse? That's the big question. The past week was the worst for the financial markets since the crisis 2008. The screens of the dealers colored deep red - the color in which losses are displayed. The S & P 500, the stock index in which the 500 largest and most important US companies are summarized lost in only seven trading days over four trillion dollars. For comparison: This corresponds to the gross domestic product in Germany. And not only shares crashed. Also, raw materials such as copper, aluminum and zinc broke. The oil price fell below $ 50, not even gold, otherwise considered a safe harbor, was spared. Of a \"pandemic panic\" was the speech. And more and more frequently from a second Lehman Brothers. However, there are differences to the panic, which followed the bankruptcy of the investment bank in September 2008. At that time it was a malformation in the financial industry, which led to a crisis in the real economy. This time it is the opposite: the concern that the pandemic could result in a recession, triggers the burglary at the courses. However, the sudden violent response to Wall Street is comparable in both cases. Even ten days ago, the S & P 500 had reached a new record high. Although the Coronavirus had already killed hundreds of people at the time and infected tens of thousands. But the investors looked mainly a problem for China. Many even hoped that Corona would provide for a new wave cheap money through the central banks. After that, it actually looks. The People's Bank of China has already lowered interest rates and also Fed boss Jay Powell has signaled that the US Federal Reserve is ready to prevent the worst. Last week, nothing was felt of this serenity. For this purpose, the message contributed that Covid-19 had reached Italy. But the virus had previously spread in South Korea and also in Iran - which hardly touched markets. The change of mood came practically overnight. This is a pattern that finds itself again and again at the financial markets. Even with Lehman, there had been any problems with the bank before the collapse before the collapse. But the end was still surprisingly on that fateful Friday, when no trading partner of the bank wanted more funds. Even with the euro crisis, it behaved similarly. Thus, investors for years of the Greek government lent money by bought their bonds. They did that because they believed that the German government and the rest of the EU would interfere, Greece should no longer be able to pay. But when in the fall of 2009, the Greek Government provides its public debt information \nDramatically increased, the investors were not so sure anymore. The risk surcharge was promptly shot up to the Greek government bonds: The euro crisis began. But the speed with which the turning into the Corona pandemic tried, Wall Street has rarely experienced. You have to go back to the year 1929 to find a comparable crash. It - and not in the violent losses per se - lies the real danger. For a large part of the market participants has borrowed the money, bought by the shares, bonds or derivatives. To satisfy your creditors, you need to sell assets. This reinforces the sales waves and leaves the prices further decline, which in turn leads to even more market participants need to sell to meet their payment obligations. A vicious circle that quickly captures areas of the capital market, which are not threatened directly from the virus and its economic consequences. And there is still a threat. While the banks were the focus of the Lehman crisis, that should not be the case this time. Especially in the US, the money houses are far better secured. But the credit risk threatens to spread in other ways. Due to the low interest rates, so-called junk bonds, ie garbage bonds, in recent years in investors enjoyed enormous popularity. These debt papers are issued by companies having a higher risk not to comply with their payment obligations. To ate investors still, they pay higher interest rates. Last week, the investors fled from the papers. They moved in recent days almost seven billion dollars from junk bond funds. To clear the scope: The inflows throughout the past year amounted to 14 billion. The ISHARES IBOXX High Yield Corporate Bond ETF, the largest US junk bond fund, reported, according to the Financial Office Service Bloomberg on Tuesday of last week with 1.6 billion dollars its largest drain to investor money in one day. Because there are no buyers for the risky bonds, companies could not borrow fresh capital. Throughout the last week, there was no new issue of Junk Bonds on the US market. Actually, this is the time a year in which companies are newly financing at the credit market. If it remains, a credit clamp is threatened, not unlike the time to Lehman. The irony is that the situation is so crisp, because the central banks supplied the financial markets worldwide with cheap money to cope with the consequences of the Lehman crisis. Great investors - including insurers, pension funds, foundations - therefore went to greater risks. There was hardly any other else, because safer investments did not waste enough yield to fulfill the commitments to relaxing storms and others. So a credit crunch could now \nTen years later the next recording. The panic because of the coronavirus would actually be Lehman 2.0 in this sense.

Pangolim, a small mammal at risk of extinction and one of the world's most smuggled animals, may have been the transmitter of the new coronavirus, which has already killed 636 people in China, defended this Friday Chinese scientists.\nResearchers at the South China University of Agriculture identified Pangolim as the \"possible intermediate host\" that facilitated the transmission of the virus, pointed out the university in a statement, without advancing more details.\nAn animal that houses a virus without becoming sick, but that can infect other species, is called \"reservoir\".\nIn the case of the new coronavirus, most analysts points out the bat with primary source: according to a recent study, the genomes of the new coronavirus are 96% equal to those who circulate in that animal's body.\nPangolim could have served as \"Intermediate Host\" between the bat and human beings, according to the new study, quoted by Chinese state press.\nThe same investigation, which tested more than 1,000 samples of wild animals, concluded that viruses detected in the pangolins are 99% identical to those found in human patients.\nThe new virus was initially detected, last December, in a shellfish and wildlife market, situated in the suburbs of Wuhan, in the center of China.\nThe initial hypothesis of the intermediary to have been the snake was, however, away.\nDuring the epidemic of atypical pneumonia, also caused by a coronavirus, and that between 2002 and 2003 paralyzed China, the intermediary was Civeta, a small mammal whose meat is appreciated in China.\nAs part of the measures to contain the recent epidemic, China announced, at the end of January, the temporary closure of wildlife markets, forbidden for the creation, transport or sale of all species of wild animals.\nPangolim is the most smuggled mammal of the world, with about one million specimens captured in the last 10 years, in Asia and Africa forests. Illegal hunting is stimulated by the increase in demand for its meat and parts of the body.\nPangolim, which has the longest language than its body and feeds from ants and termites, is protected since September 2016 by the International Convention on Trade Endangered Species, from which China is a signatory.\nIn some regions of China and Vietnam, the use of Pangolim meat is popular among young mothers, by their alleged beneficial effects for breast milk, while their scales are used in traditional pharmacopoeia.

double than the previous record high -- taking the death toll to 1,367, as authorities adopted a new diagnosis method amid concerns that the crisis is nowhere near slowing down contrary to official projections.  china's central hubei province, the epicentre of the virus outbreak, reported 242 deaths and nearly 15,000 fresh cases on wednesday, said mi feng, a spokesperson with the national health commission. twelve fatalities came from other provinces including two in henan, and one in tianjin, hebei, liaoning, heilongjiang, anhui, shandong, guangdong, guangxi, hainan, and the xinjiang production and construction corps respectively. the total deaths from the more than two-month-old virus outbreak as reported on thursday stood at 1,367, with the total number of confirmed cases mounting to 59,804, health officials were quoted as saying by the state-run xinhua news agency. the philippines reported the first death outside china from the virus. so far 445 cases have been reported from about 26 countries including three from india. amid growing public anger over the handling of the crisis, the ruling communist party of china replaced two high-ranking officials in hubei province, where coronavirus first emerged in late december in provincial capital wuhan. xinhua reported that former shanghai mayor ying yong, 61, a close ally of president xi jinping, has been appointed as the new hubei party secretary, replacing jiang chaoliang. the leader of wuhan city, ma guoqiang, 56, has been replaced by wang zhonglin, 57, the party secretary of shandong's provincial capital jinan. jiang, 61, is the highest-ranking political casualty so far in the virus outbreak. today's purge of the officials followed dismissal of the two top health officials in hubei province earlier this week. the hubei provincial health commission said wuhan has reported 14,840 new cases on wednesday, including 13,332 \"clinically diagnosed cases\", which are being treated as confirmed cases from thursday onwards as a new method of calculation. the commission said the adjustment in the calculation has been made to give those who have been clinically diagnosed with the timely standard treatment of confirmed cases. with this, the total confirmed cases in hubei province rose to 48,206, it said. while china attributed the big increase in the numbers to the change in the new methodology of calculation, significantly the rise coincides with the visit of a 15-member team of the specialists of the world health organisation which is currently visiting china. it is not yet clear whether who team is also scrutinising the numbers relating to the virus. foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang declined to confirm whether the method of calculation of the cases is approved by the who team. but at the same time, he told a media briefing online that \"the \nadvance team is here to discuss specific arrangements for the china-who joint mission with the chinese side\". \"the purpose of the joint mission is that experts of both sides can have in-depth communication on the situation and efforts of prevention and control, and come up with advice for china and other affected countries. i'll leave the specifics to the competent authorities\u201d, he said. the big hike in cases comes amid the official accounts that the cases of the coronavirus are coming down and gradually normalcy is being restored. under pressure to accommodate growing number of cases, wuhan health officials started converting dormitories, gyms of universities in the city into hospitals which raised concerns among foreign students who are stuck in the city. in the wake of development, foreign students including that of india and pakistan have started making desperate pleas to their governments to immediately evacuate them. three indian students studying in hubei university of chinese medicine have sought urgent help from the indian government to evacuate them from there. india has already evacuated 647 indian nationals mostly students from wuhan and hubei. ten indians could not board the two special flights due to fever. indian officials say around 80 to 100 indians are still in the region. about 1,000 pakistani students are currently in hubei. a number of pakistani students have complained that the dormitories of their universities are being converted into hospitals with virus patients. one such notice posted by the hubei university of chinese medicine, where three indian students were held up, said \"our university is going to use the gymnasium as the shelter to receive the confirmed cases\". the university was earlier not in the list but now an official notification has been issued to include it, the notice said. \"now we need to cooperate as requires. our whole wuhan, it's a 'war' period. hope everyone can understand. and, knows the serious situation. we will try best to ensure your basic needs. special period, special way. do not go out! do take

including the united states, and north korea. south korea has banned travellers only from \u200bthe chinese province of hubei, where the global outbreak started.   to mr moon\u2019s government, banning travelers would not have had a \u201cpractical benefit.\u201d to critics, not doing so may have helped the highly infectious pathogen spread, further undercutting the chances for the economic recovery the country craved.\u200b   an editorial in the influential conservative daily chosun ilbo warned\u200b wednesday \u200bthat fighting the outbreak without banning chinese visitors was \u201clike trying to catch mosquitoes while keeping the windows open.\u201d   mr moon\u2019s political enemies have long accused him of being pro-chinese\u200b or afraid to challenge china\u2019s leader, mr xi jinping. \u200bon\u200b feb 20, when he was on the phone with mr xi, mr \u200bmoon said that \u201cchina\u2019s difficulties are our own difficulties,\u201d according to his office.\u200b   a spokesman for mr moon, mr kang min-seok, noted that no visitor from mainland \nchina had tested positive since south korea tightened its screening of chinese arrivals on feb 4. he also cited the diminishing number of new chinese cases outside hubei.   the opposition is also lashing out at some of the government\u2019s early decisions.   as it was later discovered, members of the shincheonji church in daegu,\u200b in the southeast of south korea, began developing symptoms around feb 7-10, days before mr moon said the worst was over. the worshippers continued to attend sunday services, expectorating and spreading the virus as \u200bhundreds of congregants loudly sang and prayed in the tightly seated church.   at the time, the government repeatedly assured people that they did not need to cancel large gatherings.\u200b mr lee in-young, the majority whip in the national assembly, urged people to \u201creturn fast to normal lives.\u201d   even when mr moon said

member tested positive on feb 18, becoming south korea\u2019s 31st patient. since then, the cases have skyrocketed, sometimes doubling or tripling in a single day.   once the new coronavirus took root, south korean health officials aggressively \u200btracked down \u200band isolated patients\u200b, testing over 10,000 people a day. the recent spike in the number of confirmed cases is related in part to that aggressiveness.   officials also released data quickly. smartphone applications provided\u200b people with real-time updates on places patients had visited and \u200bsent users notifications when they approached such locales.   \u200bbut if the coronavirus appears less lethal than mers, it has proved far more contagious. as it spread across the country, south koreans began wondering whether they could trust mr moon\u2019s strategy, which relied essentially on the people\u2019s cooperation and awareness.   while the government has aggressively warned people to take precautions by wearing masks and washing hands, it has tried to keep as much of the economy running as possible.   there was also a political risk in pursuing drastic measures. when the government tried to ban weekend anti-government rallies over health concerns, the participants accused it of political suppression.   as mr moon\u2019s democratic party announced a \u201cmaximum containment\u201d of daegu and nearby towns this week, many conservative politicians took that as a decision by south korea to cordon off its own towns while being spineless toward china. the political blowback was swift, forcing the government to deny any lockdown plan. mr hong ihk-pyo, the party spokesman who \nannounced the maximum containment, resigned.   \u200bsouth koreans\u2019 anger spiked this week when they learned that some chinese cities had begun quarantining south korean visitors\u200b upon landing at their airports, while south korea had not imposed such restrictions on chinese arrivals.   an online petition to moon\u2019s office demanding a ban on chinese visitors had more than 760,000 supporters.   others in south korea focused \u200btheir ire on the shincheonji church,\u200b which has been branded as a cult by mainstream religions\u200b. the church\u2019s practices\u200b, like sitting tightly together and aggressively proselytising, have been cited as factors in the quick spread of the illness.\u200b a petition asking the government\u200b to forcibly disband the church had more than 920,000 signatories.\u200b\u200b   \u201cshincheonji has no right to talk about freedom of religion,\u201d said mr rhyu si-min, a former health minister whose youtube commentaries are \u200binfluential among supporters \u200bof mr moon. \u201cthrough their acts, they have endangered the lives of many citizens.\u201d\u200b   mr moon called for the country to join hands together, calling the coming days a \u201ccritical period\u201d in \u200bdetermining whether the virus will continue to spread through the country. \u200bthis week, his government said it would check all 210,000 shincheonji members across the country \u200bfor the virus.   others accused the government of shifting the blame to the church, when its members were also victims of the virus.   \u201cwhat we have seen so far is a total failure of our disease-prevention system\u200b,\u201d said mr choi dae-zip, president of the korean medical association, referring to\u200b his group\u2019s repeated call for an early ban on chinese visitors.\u200b\u201cthe biggest reason for that failure is

about using hydroxychloroquine as a preventive drug. hydroxychloroquine is slightly more tolerable, but is equally dangerous in its side effects if taken without supervision, as is an entire class of anti-malarial drugs. it also bears similarities in its mode of action against malaria to the world\u2019s first anti-malarial drug--quinine. in peru, the inca civilisation used the bark of the cinchona plant to treat shivering (which many say could have been caused by malaria or low-grade fever). in 1633, this herbal medicine was introduced in europe to reduce fever, but the compound quinine was first extracted from the bark in 1820. in 1944, it was synthesised in a laboratory and began to be used to treat malaria. there has never been a synthesis that can compete with the extraction from the bark. but in 1934, chloroquine was synthesised as a quinine alternative and eventually began to be used more popularly for malaria treatment, especially in areas where quinine resistance might have developed. hydroxychloroquine came along in the 1950s, and is said to be slightly less extreme in side effects than both its predecessors. it is on the world health organization\u2019s model list of essential medicines, the safest and most effective drugs needed in a health system. quinine itself is no longer on it. there has been widespread uproar over the icmr recommending the drug for protection against covid-19. doctors say the medical evidence is still too limited to be sure of hydroxychloroquine\u2019s antiviral properties. the antiviral effects of chloroquine were described in a research paper published in the lancet in 2003. chloroquine exerts direct antiviral effects, inhibiting ph-dependent steps of the replication of several viruses, including members of the flaviviruses, retroviruses and coronaviruses,\u2019 it noted. both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were shown to inhibit sars-cov-2 in a lab setting, but a further study concluded that hydroxychloroquine was more potent than chloroquine, with a more tolerable safety profile. it has been used to study several viral infections, including ebola, influenza and dengue. but several studies noted that meaningful action requires a large dose of the drug inside the cells, and it can increase toxicity, which is a key concern when using both the drugs. the idea to use hydroxychloroquine for covid-19 didn\u2019t originate from us president donald trump\u2019s tweet about the drug as a possible cure, but came from two small studies in china and france, and some anecdotes of successful treatments, including the case treated in jaipur (where it was used in combination with oseltamivir, lopinavir 200 and ritonavir). \"we have already isolated the strain of covid-19 in india. before a treatment is approved by the government, it needs much more testing. right now, doctors are using drugs based on individual symptoms,\" says dr k. sujatha rao, former union health secretary. the chinese study (which included 100 patients), \nin particular, garnered a lot of attention after it showed that hydroxychloroquine reduced the viral load. the symptoms of covid-19 were not as severe and patients were cured faster. but health organisations, including who, have not approved the use of either chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for covid-19 treatment or prevention. while both might be game-changers for the ongoing pandemic, large-scale studies need to be done before they can be certified as safe. let us not forget that when scientist hans andersag first synthesised chloroquine, it was not used for almost a decade as the initial evaluation considered it to be too toxic. it is very important to note that icmr has specified only two categories of high risk\u2019 people who should use hydroxychloroquine for prevention or prophylaxis--health workers and household contacts of positive cases. a national taskforce has been set up to ensure that the use is restricted and the drug is only sold on prescription. they have also specified in an online notice that this should not instil a false sense of security against covid-19 and users should continue with hygiene and social distancing protocols. a person reporting symptoms to the drug needs to immediately seek out the medical practitioner who prescribed it. but icmr forgot that information spreads faster than caution today. the drugs have already sold out in many online pharmacies in the country. and reports of anti-malarial drugs being in demand are doing the rounds. this was to be expected--after trump\u2019s endorsement, three people were hospitalised in nigeria for chloroquine poisoning, and the uk had to ban the export and hoarding of the drug. in india, the drug is readily available and affordable. and while doctors have attested to the drug\u2019s potential against covid-19, few are willing to take the entire leap of faith like icmr. most notably because of the potential consequences of people using the drug as self-medication. \"the adverse effects of this drug are life-threatening if taken without guidance. right now, there is mass fear against covid-19; people believe it will kill them. suddenly, if you announce a drug for prevention, and it is available readily, people will think let me also try it,\" says dr k.k. aggarwal, cardiologist and head of the confederation of medical associations of asia and oceania (cmaao). better communication should have been decided on to ensure everyone does not go out and buy it. this is certainly not a drug for home use. yet, as social media buzzes with images of people stocking up on hydroxychloroquine and other antimalarial drugs, it seems many do believe it will protect them. the quinoline family has a lot to offer modern medicine and humanity even today. but these are still to be entirely understood, and can do great damage if taken without knowledge of the side effects. in 1633, when quinine was brought to europe to be used against fever, only a select few physicians reportedly had it because the toxicity was \nextremely high and they did not know how it would affect everyone. there was no twitter, no e-medicine, and no tv--drugs could be given to a small, high risk, sample without everyone wanting to use it, which is perhaps what the icmr was aiming for. but in 2020, publicly approving

hospital in wuhan in the next 15 days in addition to the 1,000-bed hospital being built in the city in 10 days to treat more cases of the deadly virus. the feverish pace at which the hospitals are being built indicate that china apparently is preparing to treat far more patients considering the speed at which the virus is spreading. the virus has spread to hong kong, macau, taiwan, nepal, japan, singapore, south korea, thailand, vietnam and the us as of thursday. japan on friday reported a second confirmed case. the confirmed cases in china for the first time crossed the 1,000 mark and

(cdc) on tuesday alerted americans to begin preparing for the spread of coronavirus in the united states after infections surfaced in several more countries. the announcement signaled a change in tone for the atlanta-based u.s. health agency, which had largely been focused on efforts to stop the virus from entering the country and quarantining individuals traveling from china. \u201cthe data over the past week about the spread in other countries has raised our level of concern and expectation that we are going to have community spread here,\u201d dr. nancy messonnier, the cdc\u2019s head of respiratory diseases, told reporters on a conference call. what is not known, she said, is when it will arrive and how severe a u.s. outbreak might be. \u201cdisruption to everyday life might be severe\u201d and businesses, schools and families should begin having discussions about the possible impact from the spread of the virus, messonnier cautioned. in a teleconference later on tuesday, dr. anne schuchat, the cdc\u2019s principal deputy director, said that while the immediate risk in the united states was low, the current global situation suggested a pandemic was likely. \u201cit\u2019s not a question of if. it\u2019s a question of when and how many people will be infected,\u201d schuchat said. in san francisco, california\u2019s fourth-largest city, officials declared a local emergency, despite having no coronavirus cases, in an effort to raise public awareness of the virus\u2019 risks and boost preparedness. separately, u.s. health and human services (hhs) secretary alex azar told a senate subcommittee there will likely be more cases in the united states, and he asked lawmakers to approve $2.5 billion in funding to fight the outbreak after proposing cuts to the department\u2019s budget. \u201cwhile the immediate risk to individual members of the american public remains low, there is now community transmission in a number of countries, including outside of asia, which is deeply concerning,\u201d azar said, adding that recent outbreaks in iran and italy were particularly worrying. believed to have originated from illegal wildlife sold in the chinese city of wuhan late last year, the new coronavirus has infected some 80,000 people and killed close to 2,700 in china. although the world health organization says the epidemic has peaked in china, coronavirus cases have surfaced in about 30 other countries, with some three dozen deaths reported, according to a reuters tally. growing outbreaks in iran, italy and south korea have raised concerns that coronavirus will surface in other nations and worsen in those that have already reported infections, further denting a global economy that had already been hit by a dependence on china. global and u.s. stock markets fell sharply again on tuesday, as investors feared the epidemic would further damage an already slowing world \neconomy. the white house\u2019s top economic adviser, larry kudlow, said the u.s. economy would be able to ride out any disruption from the global spread of coronavirus, adding that he did not expect the federal reserve to cut interest rates to blunt the disease\u2019s economic impact. u.s. senator chuck schumer, however, said republican president donald trump and his administration had been caught \u201cflat-footed\u201d and lacked a comprehensive plan to deal with the coronavirus. he called for at least $3.1 billion in additional funding to fight it. \u201cthe trump administration has shown towering and dangerous incompetence when it comes to the coronavirus,\u201d said schumer, the senate\u2019s top democrat. \u201cmr. president, you need to get your act together now. this is a crisis.\u201d trump defended his administration\u2019s response. \u201ccdc and my administration are doing a great job of handling coronavirus, including the very early closing of our borders to certain areas of the world,\u201d trump said on twitter. dr. anthony fauci, the head of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, said it would be at least a year before a coronavirus vaccine could be made available to the public. but fauci said testing gilead sciences\u2019 (gild.o) antiviral drug remdesivir for potential treatment of coronavirus could be done in a \u201creasonable amount of time.\u201d u.s. secretary of state mike pompeo told reporters that iran may have covered up information about the spread of coronavirus there, and he accused china of mishandling the epidemic through its \u201ccensorship\u201d of media and medical professionals. \u201cthe united states is deeply concerned by information indicating the iranian regime may have suppressed vital details about the outbreak in that country,\u201d pompeo told reporters as iran\u2019s coronavirus death toll rose to 16. \u201call nations, including iran, should tell the truth about the coronavirus and cooperate with international aid organizations,\u201d pompeo said. his remarks, coming less than two months after a short-lived u.s.-iranian military clash and the signing of a u.s.-china trade deal, could inflame tensions with tehran and beijing. beijing last week revoked the credentials of three wall street journal correspondents over a column china said was racist. the united states has said it was considering a range of responses to their expulsion. \u201cexpelling our journalists exposes once again the government\u2019s issue that led to sars and now the coronavirus: namely censorship. it can have deadly consequences,\u201d pompeo said, referring to the 2002-2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, which also emerged from china. \u201cif china permitted its own and foreign journalists and medical personnel to speak and investigate freely, chinese officials and other nations would have been far better prepared to address the challenge\u201d of coronavirus, he added. despite the coronavirus epidemic, pompeo said the united states still planned to host a special meeting with the 10-member association of southeast asian \nnations (asean) in las vegas in march.

has slowed, and world health organization (who) officials said tuesday (feb 18) that china\u2019s strict limits on its people\u2019s movements have helped.   but the outbreak and its death toll continue to grow, the picture outside china has grown steadily more alarming, and experts caution against excessive optimism about the crisis peaking.   \u201cit could be unwise for anybody in china, or outside china, to be complacent that this is coming under control at this point in time,\u201d said professor malik peiris, chief of virology at the university of hong kong.   researchers in germany presented evidence tuesday that people who have the new coronavirus can infect others even when they have no symptoms, as disease experts had suspected. their findings, published in a letter in the new england journal of medicine, indicated that people may be spreading the epidemic before they know they are sick.   but the chinese government\u2019s daily tally of new infections and deaths from the virus has declined steadily since feb 12.   on tuesday, authorities reported that in the previous 24 hours, 1,886 new cases had been confirmed \u2014 the first time since jan. 30 that the number had dropped below 2,000 \u2014 and 98 patients had died. on wednesday, the number of new infections reported by authorities was again below 2,000, with china recording 1,749 confirmed new cases of coronavirus infection, bringing the country\u2019s total number of reported infections to 74,185.   with 136 deaths reported in wednesday\u2019s figures, the total number in china of those confirmed to have died from the virus surpassed 2,000, reaching 2,004.   government officials, as well as public health experts around the world, said the numbers suggested that china\u2019s aggressive measures to contain the epidemic were working. china\u2019s leader xi jinping told prime minister boris johnson of britain in a phone call tuesday that china was making \u201cvisible progress\u201d in containing the epidemic, according to chinese state media.   more than half the country\u2019s population is under some limitations on its movements, and 150 million of its people face restrictions on leaving their homes, according to an analysis by the new york times.   \u201cright now, the strategic and tactical approach in china is the correct one,\u201d dr michael ryan, the who\u2019s chief of emergency response, said tuesday. \u201cyou can argue whether these measures are excessive or restrictive on people, but there is an awful lot at stake here in terms of public health \u2014 not only the public health of china but of all people in the world.\u201d   china\u2019s lockdown has slowed the spread of the virus from its epicenter, the city of wuhan, to the rest of china by two to three days, and from china to the rest of the world by two to three weeks, who officials said.   the organization\u2019s endorsement of china\u2019s methods was an apparent \nreversal from less than three weeks earlier, when it had advised against restrictions on travel and trade. some health experts have condemned the restrictions, saying that they were preventing vital resources from getting where they were needed, and could instill panic.   professor zhong nanshan, a renowned respiratory disease expert in china, said monday that he expected the epidemic to peak in the country\u2019s southern regions by late february, and the rest of the country to follow soon after.   but dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus, the who director general said monday that the apparent tapering of the spread in china \u201cmust be interpreted very cautiously,\u201d   \u201cit\u2019s too early to tell if this reported decline will continue,\u201d he said during a news conference in geneva. \u201cevery scenario is still on the table.\u201d   since chinese officials first acknowledged the virus in december, it has been hard to judge with precision the severity and scale of the outbreak.   china has changed its criteria for diagnosis, prompting a large increase in reported infections and deaths last week. tests for the virus have not been very accurate, and people who do not seek or receive medical care may not be not counted. and people with mild or no symptoms may not realize they have the virus and may not get counted.   initially, the cases reported outside mainland china were mostly among people who had recently visited there, but increasingly, they stem from contact in other countries.   the number of cases in japan has spiked in recent days, most of them tied to a quarantined cruise ship that turned into a hotbed of transmission. other case clusters have also turned up in japan, but so far, the ship, the diamond princess, accounts for most of the cases worldwide outside of china \u2014 542 as of tuesday, an increase of 88 in one day.   on monday, more than 300 american passengers on the ship were flown to the united states and placed in a two-week quarantine. fourteen of them tested positive for the coronavirus shortly before leaving japan, but were still allowed to board the flights. us officials had started the process of evacuating them home without knowing their test results.   some of those passengers said tuesday they had been informed that a few more of them had tested positive for the virus since they arrived in the united states.   also on tuesday, the centers for disease control and prevention told more than 100 americans who have been on the diamond princess they cannot return home for at least two more weeks, after it became clear that efforts to control the virus aboard the ship had been ineffective. the passengers include some who have tested positive for the virus and are hospitalized, and others still aboard the ship who have not shown signs of illness.   japanese officials said they expected 500 people to be let off the ship wednesday. but they did not make it clear how they had concluded it was safe to release people, or how they had decided which passengers would \nleave, or who those people would be.   cambodia has allowed more than 1,000 passengers from another cruise ship, the westerdam, to disembark without testing most of them. hundreds of them flew out of the country, before one of them took ill and tested positive for the virus, raising fears of undetected cases and a further global spread.   the country\u2019s authoritarian leader, hun sen, has continued to express complacency about the outbreak, even encouraging passengers from the westerdam to go sightseeing in cambodia.   \u201ccruise ships are the weak link in the containment,\u201d said professor raina macintyre, an expert in biosecurity at the university of new south wales in australia. citing the potential for future cruise ships to harbor the virus, she said, \u201cwe could lose control of the epidemic if we don\u2019t get a tight handle on the cruise ship situation.\u201d   there are other signs the outbreak\u2019s global toll has not crested. the first coronavirus-related death outside of asia was announced saturday, when a chinese man died in france. taiwan announced its first virus-related death sunday, marking the fifth fatality outside mainland china.   the economic cost of the outbreak, which has paralyzed china, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, also continues to grow.   on tuesday, hsbc, the london-based bank with deep roots in hong kong, said that it would cut 35,000 jobs over the next three years, in part because of the coronavirus outbreak.   president moon jae-in of south korea warned tuesday that the outbreak in china is creating an \u201cemergency\u201d for the economy, saying his country could be one of the hardest hit.   if the virus starts to spread rapidly around the globe, it is unclear how other countries will respond. few other governments have the power to clamp down as thoroughly as china, or even the desire.   the lockdown in the central chinese city of wuhan, where the outbreak started, has taken a heavy human toll, making it difficult for many to find medical care or care for sick loved ones. the countrywide restrictions create their own challenges, stranding employees away from their jobs and pummeling the economy.   \u201cthis is the issue,\u201d said mr peiris. \u201cit is not clear that this is something that is replicable, even in other parts of china.\u201d   it is a complicated calculation for china and the world. though relaxed restrictions could revive the economy and ease fear and frustration, they could also lead to a resurgence of infections.   in recent days, the chinese authorities, hoping to nudge the economy back to life, have urged migrant laborers to return to work. hundreds of millions had left urban centers for the lunar new year holiday in january.   officials in the philippines said tuesday that they would allow filipino migrant workers to return to hong kong and macau, reversing an earlier ban on travel to those regions. (the bar to travel to china remains.)   \u201cthe battle\u2019s not over, because the travel restrictions can\u2019t last forever,\u201d ms macintyre said. \nthe new york times ", "label": 0}, {"content": "Twelve cases of coronaviruses detected between crew of a cruise ship in the Nile.

I controlled my temperature again and again. Luckily I managed to lower her, and my departure ran smoothly.\" This should have posted one of the women who have been diagnosed on January 24 in France with the new Coronavirus, Wechat's Messenger Service. According to BBC, the woman was previously from the city of Wuhan, where the current outbreak began to travel to Lyon. Shortly after the post office, the Chinese Embassy in Paris informed the French authorities. Meanwhile, the woman was found and is quarantined. The woman is one of three people diseased at the new coronavirus in France. This confirmed the French Minister of Health. The other two patients were previously in China, it continued. What do the cases mean for Europe and Germany? How much experts already know about the virus? And how does the situation develop in China? The cases are the first in Europe - but they are not a surprise. For days, experts have been assuming that the virus comes to Europe. Also, that Germany will receive first introduced cases in a nutshell, is considered likely. But that is no reason to worry. One reason for this assessment was, the director of the Robert Koch Institute explained to today's journal of ZDF, that there is no major infection chains \"outside of China (...). And also the European Infection Protection Agency ECDC shared this Saturday: \"European countries have the capacities to prevent and control an outbreak as soon as cases are discovered.\" The ECDC was founded only in response to the SARS pandemic 2002/2003, ie in response to a pandemic whose pathogens resembles the new coronavirus. At that time hundreds of people died worldwide, Germany also registered nine cases. In response to the SARS pandemic, most European countries also developed pandemic plans. Germany also has a national pandemic plan, which was last revised in 2016. Every two years, the pandemiefall and coordination between the federal and state countries in exercises is being tested. And so Jonas Schmidt-Chanasite also emphasizes the virologist at Bernhard Still Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg, compared to time online: \"We are very well prepared.\" In Hamburg, for example, the main actors, his institute, health offices and the Universityikum Eppendorf have been in close contact for days. The responsibilities are very clear. At the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities of the World Health Organization WHO reported an accumulation of pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause in the Central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the diseases. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. a few days then published a group \nTo call the virologen Christian's premier from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 the first diagnostic test for the new virus, the researcher provisional 2019-NCOV. With the test, the virus can be detected in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, on which, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected. Both the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as well as Mers (MIDDLE East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses which have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more than 750 died. With the MERS virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronaviruses. Many of them relate to respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example. In China, several thousand persons are suffering from them, some of them - most of them with pre-existing conditions - have died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first infection cases outside of China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been in Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection with a tourist, who came back from Wuhan, on January 24, the first cases were known in France. Meanwhile, first cases were confirmed in Germany. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. The virus can cause pneumonia that can endally end. Since it is a viral illness, antibiotics do not help. Meanwhile, it is clear that the virus can be transferred from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transfers after a dozen cases were known in medical staff. Medizors assume that the virus is transmitted above all over droplet infection. The World Health Organization calculates, as announced on January 24, at the moment that an infected one cuts 1.4 to 2.5 other people. Contest these numbers, the virus is less contagious than SARS and also the viral flu. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals. That can not be said yet. The World Health Organization said on 28 January that about one-fifth of the reported cases through the virus will be seriously ill, so in case of doubt must be treated intensive care. According to reports, the first death pots were patients who had some severe pre-existing conditions. even with others \nInfectious diseases are particularly endangered people with pre-existing conditions - such as the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so change their genome. This can cause you to become more dangerous for people in the course of an outbreak - but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) expects no similar mortality to the current time as the outbreak of SARS. Whatever doctors could help, is that you understand the outbreak and the virus - despite many gaps - always better. The outbreak of the virus was probably due to a market in the 11 million town of Wuhan, where in addition to fish and seafood, all sorts of wildlife such as snakes, foxes and pheasants are sold. One of these animals could have jumped across a person. On the animal in turn it could have been transferred from a bat, shows an analysis of the virus genome (Biorxiv: Benvenuto et al., 2020). This infection chain is also not unlikely because it resembles the SARS virus closely related to the new coronavirus. Meanwhile, it is also clear: Not all infected goods in the market. Already at the beginning of December, a patient seems to have infected elsewhere. This shows the data of Chinese physicians (The Lancet: Huang et al., 2020). Where exactly, is unclear. Possible is another animal reservoir or infection of person to person. In general: that the virus effectively transmits itself to person to person, is now safe. The World Health Organization reported four division's infection chain, that is, a person infected at the animal source, then infected a second person who has infected a third party that has passed on the virus to a fourth. Very preliminary estimates according to an infected currently 1.4 to 2.5 people. For comparison, a person who has measles is on average twelve people, a person who has the virus flu influenza, two to three. The new virus is therefore less contagious as the SARS pathogen. These numbers, says the virologist Schmidt-Chanasite are currently more a \"guideline\" to assess how the epidemic develops and what measures it needs. Even about the course of viral disease, physicians know more. About a quarter of all cases are very heavy, it was called from the WHO. According to a first case report (New England Journal of Medicine: Zhu et al., 2020), the journal The Lancet now published a study on illnesses, in which the data of forty-five patients from a hospital in Wuhan have been incorporated (Huang et al. , 2020). She shows: Most patients came to the hospital with fever and coughing, one had diarrhea. All patients had a computer tomograph \nDetectable pneumonia. On average seven days after the first symptoms, patients of the study were admitted to the hospital, after eight days their breath became scarce, a day later followed the lung failure. The study also shows that some patients got heart problems. For each tenth, an additional germ in damaged lung tissue sat down. From the forty-four patients six, that is about fifteen percent. In one of the study enclosed comments, doctors show that many infected few or no symptoms have. Therefore, it is more likely to assume that about three percent of the infected die (The Lancet: Wang et al., 2020). But also this number, writing the authors, be careful to enjoy, because \"not all patients have left their illness behind them (that is, have died or have recovered) and the true number of patients is unknown.\" According to official information, this article was diagnosed with about 1,300 people with the virus at the time of this article. To stop the further spread, Chinese authorities have taken various measures. Not only do they try to find contact persons from infected and quarantine, but also set up a hospital with about 1,000 beds, which should be ready on 3 February. Many experts consider China's response to the virus for very fast and praise - especially compared to the SARS epidemic - also the transparency of the authorities. The Science Media Center in Germany, short SMC, is a quality assurance service in Science Journalism. It is funded by universities, research institutes, companies and media. Journalists and Journalists of the SMC provide all the editors for free information provided by professionals, scientific assessments for studies and quotes of researchers and researchers on news - on topics from medicine and life science, environment and climate, energy and mobility. Shareholders of the SMC are the Science Press Conference (WPK) and the Klaus Tschira Foundation in Heidelberg. The SMC was founded in 2015 to British role model. In the latest measures, however, there is also criticism: In the past days, China brick whole cities by blocking the authorities of roads, railway lines and airports in Wuhan and adjacent cities. Of these, around 56 million Chinese are now affected in 22 cities. Many experts do not have a good idea. Lawrence Gostin, for example, Professor of Global Health at Georgetown University, said the German Science Media Center: \"A bolt of Wuhan will drive the epidemic into the underground and trigger anxiety and panic.\" In an epidemic one had to do exactly the opposite, namely the \"gaining confidence of the community\". Only then people would work, what \nIt allows authorities to track infection chains without gaps, to determine contact persons from infected and quarantine, and ultimately curb the epidemic.

(the opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for reuters.)\nby clyde russell\nlaunceston, australia, feb 27 (reuters) - the spread across the world of the chinese coronavirus has probably wiped out global crude oil demand growth for 2020, but in something of an irony it\u2019s likely to be china that will be responsible if any increase is eked out.\nthere is little doubt that the coronavirus, which started in the city of wuhan and has killed more than 2,700 people so far, will hit chinese crude consumption this month, and likely into march and april.\nbut it also seems to be the case that beijing may finally be getting a handle on containing the virus, just as it ramps up in other countries, most notably south korea, japan, iran and italy.\nthis makes it likely that chinese refiners will be keen to resume operations that have been curtailed because of the virus, but this could be delayed until april.\nthere are two reasons for the delay in resuming full crude processing in china. firstly, fuel inventories have to be drawn down and secondly march is traditionally a month when several refiners undertake scheduled maintenance, as it falls in the shoulder season between peak winter and summer demand.\nthere is also a difference between chinese domestic fuel consumption, and the country\u2019s overall crude demand, given beijing is still filling its strategic petroleum reserve, and refiners are also boosting exports of refined products.\nthis means that while some estimates suggested chinese fuel demand fell by up to 4 million barrels per day (bpd) this month as the coronavirus led to the quarantining of entire cities, the hit to crude imports may not be so dramatic.\nchina\u2019s crude imports are expected at 10.53 million bpd for february, down from 10.69 million bpd in january, according to a report on wednesday by refinitiv oil research.\na mere drop of 160,000 bpd isn\u2019t much of a dent to demand, and if the final tally is in line with the refinitiv forecast, it will put some of the more doom-laden predictions about china\u2019s crude demand into perspective.\nhowever, it\u2019s likely that the bigger hit to china\u2019s oil imports will come in march, and possibly extend into april.\nrefinitiv vessel-tracking data is showing 136 vessels carrying 177.6 million barrels are already heading to china and expect to unload in march, already over half the expected deliveries in an average recent month.\nthis will also be far from the final total, given that more cargoes are likely to leave middle eastern and russian ports in the next two weeks and still have time to reach china before the end of march.\nwhat the vessel-tracking and port data is suggesting is that while china\u2019s imports of crude may be softer than they would have been in the absence of the coronavirus, they are still holding up pretty well and the drop is nowhere near as severe as the hit to domestic fuel consumption.\nif chinese crude imports do start to recover from april onwards, it means the market focus is likely shift to how big the impact of the coronavirus will be on the rest of the world.\nwith more new cases being reported outside of china for the first time on wednesday, the risks are rising that the coronavirus may reach vulnerable countries in africa and the middle east, and could strain health systems even in developed countries.\nit\u2019s still a wait-and-see approach, but if travel bans and quarantine measures become commonplace across europe, even forecasts for zero global oil demand this year may prove optimistic.\nhowever, the epidemic, along with fears that it may become a pandemic, is driving a slump in crude prices, with brent futures dropping as low as $52.57 a barrel in early asian trade on thursday, the weakest intraday price in a year, and putting the decline since the peak this year on jan. 8 to nearly 27%.\nassuming china does contain the virus and its economy starts to recover as stimulus hopes are delivered, the current weak crude price may also drive increased buying for its strategic stockpiles.

The German Red Cross (DRK) awaits this Friday in Stuttgart further travel returns from the Coronavirus particularly affected Chinese city of Wuhan. On behalf of the Federal Government, the DRK assumes support, said a spokesman for aid organization on Thursday in Berlin. A spokesman for the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg Social Department said the health authorities are prepared for the arrival of the people. First, the south worship radio had reported about it. According to information of the German Press Agency, more than a dozen people should fly to Stuttgart. They first come with other Europeans in a French machine to Paris and are expected in the morning at Stuttgart Airport. Upon your arrival, the travelers should be examined and then be taken to a quarantine station in the district of Esslingen. The DRK had already operated a quarantine station in Germersheim (Rhineland-Palatinate), to which the first German returnees came from Wuhan on 1 February. Currently, there is still passengers of a later return flow in Berlin. Outside of mainland China, more than ten Covid-19-dead are captured, dozens of people are in critical condition. With CovID-19, the disease is referred to by the novel coronavirus SARS-COV-2. In South Korea, the number of captured infections doubled within a day by 53 to 104. A man died in a hospital in the southeastern city Cheongdo, as the centers for disease control and prevention announced. Many of the new cases were reported from Daegu and the province of North Gyeongsang. The authorities suspect that many of those affected were infected with SARS-COV-2 wife when they visited the worship of a Christian sect in Daegu. In Daegu around 2.5 million people live. For worry against an uncontrolled spread of the virus, they should now be temporarily stayed at home. Completely unclear was still the extent of possible infections in Iran. There, two Covid-19 deaths in the city of Ghom had been reported on Wednesday - previously, there was no single infection in the country. It should be two older men. According to authorities, those affected were not out of their hometown Ghom. Also contact with Chinese tourists did not have them. According to the Ministry of Health, there are also three more proven infection cases in the country. All schools and colleges in Ghom were temporarily concluded, as the State News Agency reported Irna. The nearly 1.2 million inhabitants of Ghoms should avoid physical contact. In the meantime, China has changed the countless confirmed infections again. As the Health Commission announced, clinical diagnoses should now no longer be included as confirmed cases in the statistics. the \nHeavyly affected province Hubei, where the virus had broken out, had begun only past week to count such diagnoses. The doctors determine the disease based on pulmonary images and the physical condition. Now only DNA tests in the laboratory should be decisive. In official statistics, around 75,000 infections and more than 2100 deaths were recorded in the country by Thursday. Experts have been expecting a much higher dark figure for a long time. Even a Chinese scientist now asks if the epidemic still stops and the virus disappears again. Covid-19 can become an established disease like the flu, said Wang Chen, president of the China Academy of Medical Science, in the state television. According to the Chief of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, two clinical trials with medicines are in progress in China for the treatment of patients. With preliminary results be expected in three weeks. In the testing, among other things, medications against the Aidserreger HIV. In Japan, two passengers infected with the new coronavirus died of the cruise ship \"Diamond Princess\". Previously, it was known that more than 20 of the patients who were infected on board with SARS-COV-2 are difficult to ill. Now a 84-year-old Japanese woman and an 87-year-old Japanese died as the Japanese television channel NHK reported. The cruise ship had stood in quarantine two weeks after proof of a passenger. Among the originally 3700 passengers and crew members were demonstrated until Thursday 634 infections. All those affected came in hospitals. From the negative passengers tested to the virus, more than 500 people were from board as the day before. An Italian return flyer with around 20 Italians and Ebensoviles other Europeans should land among other things in Germany. The passengers who could return to their homeland include four German citizenship and two of their spouses. A couple wants to remain in Japan first, two more Germans are demonstrably infected and treated in a Japanese clinic. Some returnees were expected from the \"Diamond Princess\" in Berlin: \"It is expected that on this Saturday there will be a landing in Tegel, again in the military part, because two Berliners and Berliners are under the passengers,\" said Health Senator Dilek Kalayci. It was planned to isolate them at home for 14 days. Those who are not living in Berlin are therefore initially brought to their hometimes by DRK employees. On the way home, then still in Cambodia, passengers of the cruise ship \"Westerdam\", with which a few days ago also 57 Germans were landed. According to the Ministry of Health of North Rhine-Westphalia \nten people from the federal state on board. Six of them are already at home. The remaining four passengers will land according to the district of Recklinghausen this Friday with an airplane in Dusseldorf.

", "label": 1}, {"content": "OECD warns about the threatening recession due to Covid-19 epidemic. The OECD is striking in the face of the Covid 19 epidemic alarm: In another spread, the eurozone or Japan could slip into a recession in the current year, warned the chief economist of the industrialized organization, Laurence Boone, in Paris. Their message is clear: \"Governments can not afford to wait.\" Of a recession, economists speak when the economy shrinks in at least two consecutive quarter years. \"We are very careful,\" surpassed the OECD expert overlooking the predictions. But one thing is already clear for the organization for economic cooperation and development (OECD): the spread of the epidemic triggered by the novel Coronavirus expresses worldwide economic growth. The question is just how strong. In a scenario, which is based on a relatively limited outbreak outside of China, the OECD takes a growth of still 2.4 percent - which has half a percentage point less than last predicted. In the previous year, the economy had increased by 2.9 percent worldwide. For Germany, a plus is adopted by gross domestic product of 0.3 percent, which are 0.1 points less than in November. In Italy, which suffers especially under the new health crisis, the economy of the new prediction is stagnated, on the other hand. If the outbreak of the novel coronavirus is longer and the Asia-Pacific region, Europe and North America broad, there are even more clear impacts to fear, the OECD fears. In this case, global growth 2020 could decrease to 1.5 percent. In this negative scenario, a recession in important economic spaces such as the Eurozone or Japan is possible. If COVID-19 spread significantly more in countries of the southern hemisphere, a stronger burglary was possible - but this was not quantified by chief economist BOONE. Given the situation, States should act now, the OECD appeals. \"Does not add a financial crisis to the health crisis,\" said Boone. In any case, the EU Commission is considering economic activity because of the coronavirus crisis. \"Today is the time to clarify that the EU is willing to use all available policy options - if and if necessary - to protect our growth from the risks of downturn,\" said EU Economic Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni in Brussels. The situation is harder than just a few weeks ago. Also, it could prove to be too optimistic to assume a rapid economic recovery. Countermeasures of individual EU states would be well examined, supplemented Gentiloni. He also referred to the announcement of Italy, despite high debt a billionless economic stimulus program. The Italian government plans an auxiliary package for the economy degraded by the Coronavirus outbreak \nin the amount of 3.6 billion euros. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank also want to use their available levers \"full extent\" to help countries fight against the new coronavirus and its economic consequences. Among other things, Member States could be helped with short-term financing packages, the bosses of the organizations, Kristalina Georgiewa of the IMF and World Bank President David Malpass, said. Such financing may be versatile, for example, to strengthen health systems and to curb epidemics, it said. The offer applies especially to poorer states with weaker health systems in which people are exposed to a higher risk, emphasized IMF and World Bank. The OECD expert also sees central banks in the duty. However, it is considered questionable how far money policy support in the Corona crisis can help. Because the main problem is not in the financial system, but in the real economy: because in China large parts of the economy are resting and the virus spreads to other countries, the international production and supply chains are disturbed. Nevertheless, the great central banks try to oppose the nervous mood in the markets. After the US Federal Reserve Fed had signaled its monetary action on Friday, the central banks of Great Britain and Japan moved on Monday. The European Central Bank (ECB) was reserved: France's central bank boss Francois Villeroy de Galhau said, one was alert and prepared, but should not lose rest. Calls after more international cooperation will be loud. The OECD stimulates a common message of the G20 club, which combines great industrial and emerging countries. The aim should be to create more confidence - that is indeed needed, because in the past week, the stock exchanges had gone on descent. \"Just as the EU Health Ministers are closely coordinating these days, the EU economic and financial ministers also need to do,\" calls for the Berlin FDP Vice Fusion Chief Michael Theurer. The largest economy of the Eurozone has an interest in it, because the \"corona crisis meets Germany in an economic difficult phase,\" sums up the parliamentarian.

Although the new virus is saving one of the groups considered vulnerable, children, and being a threat to middle-aged and older adults, has also hit, among their mortal victims, more men than women.\nAccording to an evaluation, taken at the end of the week by China's control and disease prevention center, men and women are infected in approximately equal numbers by coronavirus. However, the male mortality rate is 2.8%, compared with 1.7% women, reveals the New York Times.\nThe surge of viral pneumonia Covid-19, which has affected at least 77 thousand people in China, causing 2400 mortals, \"is a crisis\" and \"a huge test\" for the Chinese authorities, said the president of that country, in statements transmitted State television on Sunday.\nAccording to the same North American newspaper, men were also more affected during the surge of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in 2002/2003; And Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) in the last five years.\nFor example, according to a study published in Annals of Internal Medicine in Hong Kong, in 2003, more women than men were infected by SARS, but the mortality rate among men was 50% higher. As for MERS, death reached 32% of infected men and 25.8% of women. The New York Times goes until 1918, the pneumonic influenza, known as Spanish flu, to confirm that more men than women died.\nWhat makes men be less resistant? \"We have already seen this happening with other viruses. Women fight better against them than men, \"begins by replying Sabra Klein, researcher at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg public health school, who studies sexual differences in viral infections and vaccine reactions, adding that women also produce immune responses Further after vaccination. Men have more difficulty in combating infections.\nThe response is in the female immune system, which is more resistant, confirms Janine Clayton, the National Institute of Health and Women's Health Investigator, to the New York Times. But it is better for respiratory viruses, the same can no longer be said from autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid or lupus arthritis, in which women are more likely to become sick than men, adds it.\nFor no definitive responses that explain why it is the immune system of women stronger than men, but one of the hypotheses has to do with female sex hormones, estrogens, which seem to contribute to the strengthening of the immune system, as well as the fact that they have two X chromosomes, while men have only one.\nExperiences made with mice to SARS coronavirus showed that males were more susceptible to infection, a difference that increased with age. They developed the disease with lower viral exhibitions than they, as they had larger damage to the lungs. When Microbiology researchers at the University of Iowa, led by Stanley Perlman, blocked estrogens in infected females or removed the ovaries, they had more hypotheses to die than the female mice that had not been interventioned. Therefore, estrogens have a protective role.\nBut there are other health and behavioral factors that can justify feminine resistance to viruses. For example, in China, the fact that men smoke more than women - they represent only 2% of a universe of 316 million smokers, a third of the world smokers - can help they do not resist so well to virus Respiratory tract attack.\nStill in that country, they have higher rates of type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. They, a little all over the world, have healthier habits of life than they, which can also contribute to their resistance.\nSubscribe newsletters for free and receive the best of the publicity and the deepest jobs of the public.\nDownload the public app, subscribe to our notifications and are aware of the evolution of the new coronavirus.

'somewhere in the middle'   the ratio of confirmed cases to deaths suggests a mortality rate of 3.4 percent, but several studies have concluded that up to two-thirds of infections in china and elsewhere have gone undetected, which would make the virus far less deadly.   \"at the moment, we don't have a good understanding of the real mortality rate,\" ms sharon lewin, director of the doherty institute for infection and immunity at the university of melbourne told australian television.\u00a0   \"it is estimated at about two percent.\"   with sars\u00a0\u2014 which killed nearly one in 10 patients\u00a0\u2014 early mortality figures turned out to be underestimates, in part because victims of the virus did not die quickly.   with the 2009 h1n1 influenza pandemic, however, the opposite happened, said ms viboud.   \"within a few weeks of the outbreak, the mortality estimate declined first 10-fold, and then 100-fold, as we moved from severe pneumonia to getting all flu cases.\"   \"here, i think we are somewhere in the middle,\" she added, saying the current two per cent mortality estimate could well decline.   the seasonal flu has an average mortality rate of about 0.1 percent but is highly infectious, with up to 400,000 people worldwide dying from it each year.   the china cdc study showed that covid-19 was \"mild\" for more than 80 per cent of confirmed cases. afp ", "label": 1}, {"content": "don't call us coronavirus: northeast students say in touching viral video. the outbreak of the novel coronavirus has created a lot of panic among people. but amid this, cases of racism and discrimination have also come forward, like people passing problematic comments towards citizens from north east states.\nrecently a video of students, living in a small village in punjab called chunni kalan, also went viral on social media because of the same reason. the students took to facebook to post a video explaining how after the virus outbreak, people have been calling them with names such as coronavirus.\nthe video was shared on a facebook page called dimapur 24/7 with the caption, \"stop calling us corona, ch***i, chinese ... north east students of punjab. #govt_of_india #say #no #to #racism #students #northeast #india.\"\nwatch the video here:\nthe clip starts with a girl saying, \"abhi jo chal raha hai yeh coronavirus, humare upar bahut effect ho raha hai kyunki pehle toh humein nepali, ch***i, chinese yeh sab bolta tha, abhi toh coronavirus ho gaya hai.\"\nin the video, the students shared instances where people labelled them as coronavirus because according to them they look chinese. they can be seen appealing to people to not do this as it is hurtful, discouraging and impacts their studies. they even said that few of their friends were denied to stay on rent because people thought they were from china.\nthe students also urged the viewers to educate themselves about the map of india and know more about the northeast states.\nafter being shared, the video immediately went viral and managed to garner around 301k views. many users took to the comments section to share their stories and express their anger.\nat the time of writing this article, the video had around 604 comments and 3.2k shares.

They are asymptomatic and, if they had had any symptoms, they had not been able to travel. \"He explains, on the phone, that when they arrive in Madrid they will be given another test and then they will go to\" normal hospitalization to pass that prevention quarantine. \"While pretending that trip, a few hours ago, the Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the international emergency by the outbreak to launch a \"global action\" that contains the advance of the virus and, in the community, the counseling of healing established a protocol that has sent to all hospitals in the region to handle, if there were, to patients suspected of infection by this virus. The alarm that the landing of that plane can generate in the citizenship is normal - for the novelty From the virus-, but lacking arguments. Dr. Padilla explains why. Is there a risk of contagion in Madrid? The risk is currently none, because there is no case in Spain. Although it seems a very Tran virus Simible [has had a rapid propagation], it can only occur if it has traveled to that specific area of \u200b\u200bChina or has been had contact with people who have done it. But today the risk is zero. Is it advisable to take precautions? At the moment we do not have to do anything beyond being pending the new information given by the Ministry of Health and follow its recommendations as well as those published by the Community of Madrid. It is not necessary to go to pharmacies a by masks or use the disinfecting alcohol from hands for everything and everywhere. You have to have the same precautions that we apply with the flu or other viruses that visit us every year, for example, never cough in the hands, but in a handkerchief and then discard it or in the elbow. How is Madrid prepared to face the arrival of these evacuated citizens? Tranquility has to be maximum, public health in Spain and in Madrid is excellent, with excellent microbiology services and with large hospitals that have the service where you can do the tests for the virus if necessary, although, by \nThe moment, who has to confirm officially any suspicion is the national microbiology center (CNM), in Majadahonda. What if a case appeared in the community? Also tranquility would have to be absolute. We have two hospitals with insulation units, that of La Paz-Carlos III and the G\u00f3mez Ulla military hospital, where patients could be. So far this virus has no treatment, nor do many other viruses have it, and what they need are good support measures. Oxygen in case of pneumonia, for example, or good intensive care services. Hospitals are launching multidisciplinary teams to adopt the measures of the Community Protocol of Madrid, formed by emergency, preventive, microbiology, infectious and UVI physicians. The Protocol referred to as Dr. Padilla establishes the guidelines for managing possible cases when the symptoms were given that the Ministry of Health has collected in a document. \"The most common include cough, sore throat, fever and sensation of lack of air. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, important difficulty breathing, renal failure and even death. The most serious cases, generally occur in Elderly people or who suffer from some other disease such as, from the heart, lung or immunity problems. \" Although it is not yet accurately known how contagion occurs, the most accepted form is through contact and drops that may be expelled when coughing. The document states that \"in the first contact with patients who come to hospital emergency services\" it is necessary to ask if he has traveled to the province of Hubei, in China, in the 14 days prior to the beginning of the symptoms or if he has been In contact with a confirmed or probable case of 2019-ncov. If the answer was affirmative, the first part of the protocol would begin, which consists of the placement of surgical mask for both the patient and the personnel that accompany you and isolation in an individual habituation to make the corresponding tests. If the suspicion was confirmed, it would have to be notified immediately to public health and the samples needed to send them to the National Center of Microbiology (which should communicate the results in less than 24 hours), while, the patient would have to continue in isolation until you get the results. and, \"If the patient's clinical situation presents gravity criteria before knowing the diagnosis pending the Laboratory of the CNM, after public health authorization, the patient may be transferred to the reference hospital: La Pazo-Carlos III Hospital\" , explain the Ministry of the Counseling. In that case, \"will be public health who makes communication to La Paz-Carlos III hospital and contact the Summa 112 for the transfer of the patient\". The Health Counselor believes that it is \nEssential to give the information and give it responsively: \"You have to be expectant, yes, but calm. and raise awareness of the population of what reality is. Right now, today, the population does not run any risk. \" If at some point it happened, the region, alleges the counselor, \"is absolutely prepared\". explains that this Thursday was updated with the last minute information and next to the Ministry of Health, the Primary Protocol for Primary Care and Hospitals and also the management of suspicious patients: \"Both in the epidemiological and the assistance, it is all registered and defined. Itineraries, patient processes, staff ... \". As more information is known as the virus - whose mortality experts tasan between 2% and 3%, low compared to similar viruses, according to the data so far available - will be changing the protocols if necessary. Vigilanting that information, in Madrid, a specific committee that according to the counselor has already met three times and that it is formed by the whole spectrum of specialists that the situation requires, \"in perfect coordination\" with the ministry. \"In any case, if a case occurs, Madrid has the assistant dimension ready for what I can reach. But for the moment, tranquility and responsibility. \" Follow us today Madrid on Facebook, on Twitter and in our neighborhood courtyard on Instagram ", "label": 1}, {"content": "coronavirus: lockdown

 \n the coronavirus family of viruses includes the common cold and more serious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers).  \n many of those with the new virus who have died had pre-existing medical conditions or were elderly, those with weakened immune systems.  \n coronavirus infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, cough and breathing difficulties.  \n statistics from china indicate that about 2% of peopleinfected with the new virus have died, suggesting it may be deadlier than seasonal flu but less deadly than sars, which killed about 10% of infected individuals. the mers outbreak in 2012 had a fatality rate of about 35%.  \n scientists have labelled the new virus 2019-ncov.  \n  \n how is it transmitted and how can it be prevented?  \n the virus can be transmitted via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes, and can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles.  \n experts have said it is more easily transmitted than the sars virus. the incubation period is up to 14 days. people may be able to infect others before symptoms appear.  \n the world health organization (who) recommends that people frequently wash hands, cover mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing, and avoid close contact with those who are sick.  \n  \n do face masks help?  \n \"we recommend the use of masks for people who have symptoms ... because the virus transmits through droplets,\" says medical expert sylvie briand.  \n but they do not guarantee protection against infection.  \n \"for people who don't have symptoms, the mask in fact is not useful,\" briand says.  \n the american centers for disease control's advice is that face masks are not required for the general public.  \n  \n is there any treatment?  \n there is no vaccine.  \n chinese scientists were able to identify the genetic sequence of the new coronavirus and shared it publicly. scientists in australia have developed a lab-grown version ofthe virus, a step toward creating a vaccine.  \n drugmakers around the globe expect to begin testing experimental vaccines on humans in about three months.  \n  \n where has it spread?

called aerosols -- formed through sneezing and coughing. the usual time of suspension is about 30 minutes. but they can stay suspended for up to two hours. gravity brings them down and the chances of the novel coronavirus trapped inside those droplets entering a human's respiratory tract get reduced to minimum this way.\nhowever, in some cases, the novel coronavirus containing aerosols have travelled up to the ventilator of isolation wards of the covid-19 patients. this is against the hitherto held view that novel coronavirus does not travel through air.\nto believe that novel coronavirus does not travel through air and start falling could be misleading. this puts health workers at greater risk if they are attending to novel coronavirus patients.\nthis also means healthy people visiting hospitals without adequate protective gear are at the risk of contracting the novel coronavirus and become a vector of covid-19 even if they don't immediately show symptoms.\nto put it in simpler words, it is important to remember that touch is not the only way to get infected by novel coronavirus. since people cannot stay long without breathing, visiting such places where novel coronavirus laden aerosols are suspended, falling or travelling in air can make a healthy person a covid-19 patient.\nthe good part is that the scientists working on the novel coronavirus have found that the contagion in such aerosols loses its ability to infect very fast. and, even a 10-minute time lag reduces the chances of spread significantly.\navoiding this enemy is the key. with scientists working to know novel coronavirus more and more every day, this knowledge is the weapon to protect oneself and let the virus die its own death.

kaisa has already sold us$1.2 billion (s$1.67 billion) of bonds this year and in january, bought a site in hong kong's new territories for hk$3.5 billion (s$630 million) to expand its foothold in the city.   but while the likes of kaisa, shimao and china evergrande group have hundreds of property projects nationwide, the majority of china's developers are small and unlisted, with sometimes just a handful of projects in one city. they're the ones most at risk from the twin forces of coronavirus and a slowing market.   smaller developers also typically do not rely on bank loans or bond sales to alleviate funding concerns. instead, they count on inflows from apartment sales, as well as shadow financing.   policymakers have so far refrained from unleashing wholesale monetary stimulus measures for real estate firms, fearing that could result in a surge in home prices. most support has come from marginal easing by local governments. the central bank reiterated earlier this month that real estate \"definitely\" won't be used to stimulate the economy.   shenzhen on \nwednesday allowed builders to draw on some cash deposits, which are usually held in reserve by banks during construction to ensure developers don't abandon projects. still, local officials stressed the current home-buying restrictions won't be loosened.   coronavirus may be the \"straw that broke the camel's back for many small builders\", said xie yangchun, an analyst at china real estate information corp.   \"a new wave of industry consolidation has started.\" ", "label": 1}, {"content": "Everyone speak of the pneumonias of Coronavirus, but what about those who kill 2,000 children every day? The world is in the middle of an emergency caused by pneumonia. And no, I not only speak of the croconavirus outbreak that began in Wuhan, China. While the public health authorities struggle to contain the dangerous viral agent of the SARS type -COV2019, as it is known - child pneumonia is today the biggest infectious killer of children, causing a life every 39 seconds. Despite this, the international community has responded to that emergency with little more than a collective shoulder shrinkage. Maybe this is because most people think that pneumonia is first of all a threat to the elderly, which is true. The Coronavirus, which kills through a severe and acute respiratory infection, has reinforced this perception. Most victims have been elderly with pre-existing health conditions. However, pneumonia is nowadays the biggest cause of infectious death in children and more than 800,000 lives a year is charged. Most victims are under 2 years of age. Almost all deaths occur in the poorest countries in the world. There are no statistics that can capture the human tragedy that is in the center of that emergency. Cailed by bacteria, viral agents or fungi, this is a disease that attacks air bags from the lungs, causing them to inflame and fill in pus. Children are \"fighting - fighting for breathing. The good news is that children's pneumonia can be defeated. Effective pneumococcal vaccines (PCVs) can prevent non-viral cases, and GAVI (the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization) has financed the vaccination of more than 120 million children. With an early and precise diagnosis by a health worker, most cases can be treated successfully with basic antibiotics that cost less than 45 cents. Even the most severe cases can be treated with higher level antibiotics and medical oxygen. In recent research carried out in Nigeria hospitals, it has been found that a combination of medical oxygen and a diagnostic instrument called pulse oximeter, which measures oxygen levels in the blood, can reduce the mortality rate in half. Now the bad news. Although the deaths from children's pneumonia are decreasing, they do it more slowly than those of other major murderers such as malaria and measles. Five years ago, Governments signed the commitment of sustainable development objectives (SDGs) to \"put an end to preventable child deaths\" for the year 2030. If current trends are maintained, pneumonia will convert that promise in (another) promise Unfulfilled, which will further weaken the credibility, already fragile, from governments, donors and international organizations responsible for fulfilling the SDGs. So, why is the world's largest children's killer generated \nSo little action and international cooperation? As I have discussed in another space with Devi Sridhar - global public health prompt from the University of Edinburgh, the profile of the victim is part of the explanation. With malnutrition as main risk factor, pneumonia is the definitive disease of poverty. Those who face the greatest risks - the poor of the rural areas and the inhabitants of the urban marginal neighborhoods - lack a voice in the priorities of the healthcare agenda. And although the poorest children face the greatest risks, they are the least likely to be immunized, the last ones in the treatment list and the most risk of receiving an inaccurate diagnosis. Pneumonia allows to check the (in) equity of health systems. When the symptoms of the disease appear, the poorest households often delay treatment because they are concerned about their cost, or because the nearest clinic is far away. In many cases, clinics lack trained personnel and diagnostic equipment they need to provide effective treatment. There are some encouraging signs that suggest that inertia is giving way to action. This week governments, donors, researchers, UN agencies and civil society organizations meet in Barcelona at the First World Forum on Child Pneumonia. The objective is to share evidence and, what is more important, to promote the control strategies of pneumonia and action plans aimed at converting these evidence into vida policies. New alliances are emerging for change, commanded by the Coalition Every Breath Counts (each encouragement account). One of the barriers to effective anti-pneumonia action has been the increasingly anachronous debate between the defenders of \"vertical\" or specific interventions, and \"horizontal\" approaches aimed at strengthening health systems. The substantive issues that are at stake are real. Too often, donors pronounce the horizontal discourse, emphasizing their commitment to strengthening health systems, but then carry out resources in specific interventions for the disease that distort health priorities. While the World Bank exalts the virtues of strengthening health systems, its funds greatly divert resources towards vertical interventions. In the same way, health systems must respond to diseases that endanger the poor. The idea that countries can advance towards the Holy Grail of universal health coverage without addressing diseases such as pneumonia, and without breaking the link between malnutrition and broader health risks, is a fiction. The point of entry for effective action is primary health care and support for community health workers. \nHealth systems that divert resources towards higher level installations, out of the reach of the poor, will never be limited to a drip effect. The Coronavirus has provided a painful but timely reminder that we are members of a single human community. In our interconnected world, an epidemic of health that begins in Wuhan can, in a few weeks, raise threats to health from Bombay to New York. Multilateralism and international cooperation are our only defense. But the argument in favor of multilateral action does not stop with the epidemics that cross borders and affect the public of rich countries. Today, pneumonia will kill more than 2,000 children. That is a health emergency, and it is one that we can stop. Kevin Watkins is General Director of Save the Children United Kingdom.

The Caf\u00e9 Chain Starbucks made more than half of her branches in China tight, but he realized that the outlook for 2020 could not be updated until the consequences for the company could be reasonably assessed.\nStrongly affected by the coronavirus are trips and tourism. The US airlines Delta Air Lines and American Airlines, for example, have temporarily deleted all flights from and to China. Due to persistent concerns about the virus, air traffic from 6 February until 30 April, Delta announced. American Airlines announced on Friday to suspend operation on all routes to China until March 27th. Boeing's Financial Chef Greg Smith warned against consequences for air traffic.

health research institute (kpwhri) in seattle as the first participant received the investigational vaccine. \"i'm pleased to report today that a vaccine candidate has begun the phase one clinical trial. this is one of the fastest vaccine development launches in history. not even close. we're also racing to develop antiviral therapies and other treatments,\" trump told reporters at a white house news conference on monday. the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid), part of the national institutes of health (nih), is funding the trial. the open-label trial will enrol 45 healthy adult volunteers aged 18 to 55 years over approximately six weeks. \"finding a safe and effective vaccine to prevent infection with sars-cov-2 is an urgent public health priority,\" said niaid director anthony s fauci. \"this phase 1 study, launched in record speed, is an important first step towards achieving that goal,\" he said. vaccine is called mrna-1273 according to the nih, the study is evaluating different doses of the experimental vaccine for safety and its ability to induce an immune response in participants. this is the first of multiple steps in the clinical trial process for evaluating the potential benefit of the vaccine. the vaccine is called mrna-1273 and was developed by the niaid scientists and their collaborators at the biotechnology company moderna, inc., based in cambridge, massachusetts. the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations (cepi) supported the manufacturing of the vaccine candidate for the phase 1 clinical trial, the nih said. according to its website, cepi so far has secured usd 760 million toward its usd 1 billion funding target, with multi-year funding from norway, the uk, germany, japan, canada, ethiopia, australia, the bill & melinda gates foundation, and wellcome. among its 12 voting members are cherry gagandeep kang from christian medical college vellore and rajeev venkayya vaccine business unit, takeda pharmaceutical company limited. indian soumya swaminathan is a non-voting member and represents the world health organization (who) in the board. early this week, cepi, the organisation set up to accelerate the development of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases, made an urgent call for usd 2 billion to support the development of a vaccine against the virus responsible for covid-19. in a statement, the nih said that infection with sars-cov-2, the virus that causes covid-19, can cause a mild to severe respiratory illness and include symptoms of fever, cough and shortness of breath. the number of deaths due to coronavirus has passed 7,000 worldwide. more \nthan 175,530 cases have been recorded in 145 countries. no approved vaccines exist now covid-19 cases were first

58 deaths have been reported in the united states as of march 15, according to the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc). \"currently, no approved vaccines exist to prevent infection with sars-cov-2,\" the nih said, adding that investigational vaccine was developed using a genetic platform called mrna (messenger rna). the investigational vaccine directs the body's cells to express a virus protein that, it is hoped, will elicit a robust immune response. the mrna-1273 vaccine has shown promise in animal models, and this is the first trial to examine it in humans, it said. scientists at niaid's vaccine research center (vrc) and moderna were able to quickly develop mrna-1273 because of prior studies of related coronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers). the phase 1 trial is led by lisa a jackson, md, senior investigator at kpwhri. study participants will receive two doses of the vaccine via intramuscular injection in the upper arm approximately 28 days apart. each participant will be assigned to receive a 25 microgram (mcg), 100 mcg or 250 mcg dose at both vaccinations, with 15 people in each dose cohort, according to a statement. the first four participants will receive one injection with the low dose, and the next four participants will receive the 100 mcg dose. investigators will review safety data before vaccinating the remaining participants in the 25 and 100 mcg dose groups and before participants receive their second vaccinations. another safety review will be done before participants are enrolled in the 250 mcg cohort. \"this work is critical to national efforts to respond to the threat of this emerging virus. we are prepared to conduct this important trial because of our experience as an nih clinical trials center since 2007,\" dr jackson said.

movies and music \u2014 in short, to stay engaged in the world and fulfill many activities of their regular lives.   ms karey maniscalco, an american real estate agent who was quarantined with her husband, roger, on the same cruise ship, found isolation surprisingly busy. \u201cthe last couple of days, we\u2019ve been just catching up on work online and doing a lot of facebooking,\u201d she said in an interview last week, before the us government evacuated most american passengers from the ship and flew them back to the united states, where they will continue to be quarantined.\u00a0   \u201cour inboxes are constantly full. keeping up on social media is surprisingly very time-consuming.\u201d she started posting tiktok videos to stave off what she said could be \u201coverwhelming\u201d emotion. \u201ci woke up realising that i\u2019m still here and just started crying.\u201d engaging on social media, she said, \u201ckeeps me too busy to sit and dwell, i guess.\u201d   in china, ms isabel dahm, 22, has been able to see her cats and dog back home in minnesota through chats with her father, mr bob dahm, using an app, wechat. she is in zhejiang province, where she\u2019s been teaching english since november and is now largely relegated to her apartment under semi-quarantine.   \u201ci think if this was happening in the middle ages, i would\u2019ve actually gone insane weeks ago,\u201d ms dahm said by email.   she is allowed out of her apartment only every other day, so she is teaching her class online from her computer in her small efficiency

gate,\u2019\u201d her father said.   more substantively, those under quarantine have had unprecedented access to information about the virus itself. for example, in shenzhen, in the guangdong province, which has the highest infection rate outside of wuhan, ms krista lang blackwood, a teacher from kansas city, missouri, follows virus updates from the world health organization and the centers for disease control and prevention. sometimes, she and her family look out their fifth-floor window and wonder if the quiet streets are telling them infection is spreading. then they check the phone to find out.   in earlier times, ms lang blackwood noted in an email, people probably would have fretted over how close the nearest case of illness was. \u201cin the 21st century, don\u2019t worry! there\u2019s an app for that!\u201d she wrote.   \u201cyou can literally look at your neighborhood and see where each reported case is on a map. we have no idea who runs that app, since it\u2019s all in chinese, but, on the app, there is no red exclamation point at the apartment complex down the street.   \u201cit\u2019s an odd combination,\u201d she added, \u201cof glut of information combined with isolation\u201d.   this widespread connectivity appears to be changing the nature of isolation according to experts in two disparate fields \u2014 those who study the sociology of technology use and those who study quarantine. in 1918, during the flu pandemic, parts of the united states embraced a strategy called \u201csocial distancing\u201d, that was explicitly intended to limit interpersonal exposure. only one-third of households had phones, and people were afraid to touch newspapers, fearing the spread of germs.   research, going back decades, shows specific instances in which new media helped limit isolation. journal articles from the early days of radio show how radio transmissions lifted the spirits of people in isolation at hospitals. an experiment in the late 1950s in omaha, nebraska, found that a closed-circuit television signal helped the mood of patients at a mental hospital when they could see and respond to their relatives.   in 1832, when a cholera outbreak struck north america, newspapers carried news of the infection as it spread.   \u201cthere is a long history of new media in transforming these moments over time,\u201d said dr jeremy green, director of the history of medicine department at johns hopkins school of medicine. the current media seems to combine all that which has come before \u2014 letter writing, video, radio and television, and all instantly and everywhere. referring to the swine flu pandemic of 2009, he said, \u201ceven with h1n1, we didn\u2019t see this particular outcropping of social networking.\u201d   dr \njeremy nobel, an adjunct instructor at the department of global health and social medicine at harvard medical school, warned that the widespread ability to communicate comes with the equally powerful ability to manipulate, distort and censor information. as a result, he said, people under quarantine may be left to ponder if governments are telling the truth, creating tension between the comfort of interpersonal communications and discomfort of official ones. \u201cin an era of fake news,\u201d he said, \u201cpeople might ask: what is fact, and what is truth?\u201d

with friends and colleagues in china who have family and friends in wuhan, the epicentre of the virus. ms lin said that when someone posted a video that included criticism of the chinese government, it often disappeared before it could be seen by everyone in the group.   the surveillance became so worrisome that the group recently abandoned wechat, which is owned by a chinese company, in favor of an encrypted mobile phone service, like telegram or whatsapp. she said she preferred not to name the precise one to keep it below the government radar.   a small but growing body of scholarship backs up the idea that social interactions can stimulate reward centers of the brain and, in turn, dampen a stress response, and enhance resilience and even physical health. mr david creswell, an associate professor of psychology at carnegie mellon university who works on that research, said that it stood to reason that smartphones, to the extent they are used to make welcome social connection, could diminish the stress of isolation.   mr james katz, a professor of emerging media at boston university, said: \u201cwithout contact, it\u2019s solitary confinement, which is seen as a cruel and unusual

makeshift markets across the country, arresting nearly 700 people for breaking the temporary ban on catching, selling or eating wild animals. the scale of the crackdown, which has netted almost 40,000 animals including squirrels, weasels and boars, suggests that china's taste for eating wildlife and using animal parts for medicinal purposes is not likely to disappear overnight, despite potential links to the new coronavirus. traders legally selling donkey, dog, deer, crocodile and other meat told reuters that they plan to get back to business as soon as the markets reopen. \"i'd like to sell once the ban is lifted,\" said gong jian, who runs a wildlife store online and operates shops in china's autonomous inner mongolia region. \"people like buying wildlife. they buy for themselves to eat or give as presents because it is very presentable and gives you face.\" gong said that he was storing crocodile and deer meat in large freezers but would have to kill all the quails he had been breeding as supermarkets were no longer buying his eggs and they cannot be eaten after freezing. scientists suspect, but have not proven, that the new coronavirus passed to humans from bats via pangolins, a small ant-eating mammal whose scales are highly prized in traditional chinese medicine. some of the earliest infections were found in people who had exposure to wuhan's seafood market, where bats, snakes, civets and other wildlife were sold. china temporarily shut down all such markets in january, warning that eating wild animals posed a threat to public health and safety. that may not be enough to change tastes or attitudes that are deeply rooted in the country's culture and history. \"in many people's eyes, animals are living for man, not sharing the earth with man,\" said wang song, a retired researcher of zoology at the chinese academy of sciences. online debate the outbreak of the new coronavirus, which has killed more than 1,600 people in china, revived a debate in the country about the use of wildlife for food and medicine. it previously came to prominence in 2003 during the spread of sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome), which scientists believe was passed to humans from bats, via civets. many academics, environmentalists and residents in china have joined international conservation groups in calling for a permanent ban on trade in wildlife and closure of the markets where wild animals are sold. online debate within china, likely swayed by younger people, has heavily favored a permanent ban. \"one bad habit is that we dare to eat anything,\" said one commenter called sun on a news discussion forum on chinese website sina. \"we must stop eating wildlife and those who do should be sentenced to jail.\" nevertheless, a minority of chinese still like to eat wild animals in the belief it is healthy, providing \nthe demand that sustains wildlife markets like that in wuhan and a thriving online sales business, much of which is illegal. one online commenter calling themselves onlooker pharaoh said on chinese news platform hupu that the risk was worth it: \"giving up wildlife to eat as food is like giving up eating because you might choke.\" government support the breeding and trading of wild animals in china is supported by the government and is a source of profit for many people. after the sars outbreak, the national forestry and grassland administration (nfga) strengthened oversight of the wildlife business, licensing the legal farming and sale of 54 wild animals including civets, turtles and crocodiles, and approved breeding of endangered species including bears, tigers and pangolins for environmental or conservation purposes. these officially sanctioned wildlife farming operations produce about $20 billion in annual revenue, according to a 2016 government-backed report. \"the state forestry bureau has long been the main force supporting wildlife use,\" said peter li, a china policy specialist for the humane society international. \"it insists on china's right to use wildlife resources for development purposes.\" much of the farming and sale of wildlife takes place in rural or poorer regions under the blessing of local authorities who see trading as a boost for the local economy. state-backed television programs regularly show people farming animals, including rats, for commercial sale and their own consumption. however, activists pushing for a ban describe the licensed farms as a cover for illegal wildlife trafficking, where animals are specifically bred to be consumed as food or medicine rather than released into the wild. \"they just use this premise to do illegal trading,\" zhou jinfeng, head of china's biodiversity conservation and green development foundation, told reuters. \"there are no real pangolin farms in china, they just use the permits to do illegal things.\" the nfga did not respond to requests for comment. blurred lines animal products, from bear bile to pangolin scales, are still used in some traditional chinese medicine, an industry china wants to expand as part of its belt and road initiative. but the distinction between legal and illegal is blurred. the united nations estimates the global illegal wildlife trade is worth about $23 billion a year. china is by far the largest market, environmental groups say. the environmental investigation agency (eia), an independent organization based in london which campaigns against what it sees as environmental abuses, said in a report this week the coronavirus outbreak has in fact boosted some illegal wildlife trafficking as traders in china and laos are selling rhinoceros horn medicines as a treatment to reduce fever. china's top legislature will toughen laws on wildlife trafficking this year, the official xinhua news agency reported this week. \"we are in a sun-setting business,\" said xiang chengchuan, a \nwholesale wildlife store owner in the landlocked eastern anhui province. \"few people eat dogs now, but it was popular 20 years ago.\" xiang, who sells gift boxes of deer antlers and dog, donkey and peacock meat to wealthy bank clients and others, said he had frozen his meat as he waits to see if the ban will continue. \"i will resume selling once the policy allows us, but now i have no idea how long it [the ban] will last.\" ", "label": 1}, {"content": "surging traffic is slowing down the internet as coronavirus keeps people at home. washington (nytimes) - in late january, as china locked down some provinces to contain the spread of the coronavirus, average internet speeds in the country slowed as people who were stuck inside went online more often and clogged the networks. in hubei province, the epicentre of infections, mobile broadband speeds fell by more than half.   in mid-february, when the virus hit italy, germany and spain, internet speeds in those countries also began to deteriorate.   and last week, as a wave of stay-at-home orders rolled out across the united states, the average time it took to download videos, e-mails and documents increased as broadband speeds declined 4.9 per cent from the previous week, according to ookla, a broadband speed testing service. median download speeds dropped 38 per cent in san jose, california, and 24 per cent in new york, according to broadband now, a consumer broadband research site.   quarantines around the world have made people more reliant on the internet to communicate, work, learn and stay entertained. but as the use of youtube, netflix, zoom videoconferencing, facebook calls and video gaming has surged to new highs, the stress on internet infrastructure is starting to show in europe and the us - and the traffic is probably far from its peak.   \"this is totally unprecedented,\" said mr thierry breton, a european union commissioner who oversees digital policy and was a chief executive of france telecom. \"we have to be proactive.\"   to head off problems, european regulators like mr breton have pushed streaming companies such as netflix and youtube to reduce the size of their video files so they do not take up as much bandwidth. in the us, regulators have given wireless carriers access to more spectrum to bolster the capacity of their networks.   some tech companies have responded to the call to ease internet traffic. youtube, which is owned by google, said this week that it would reduce the quality of its videos from high to standard definition across the globe. disney delayed the start of its disney plus streaming service in france by two weeks, and microsoft's xbox asked gaming companies to introduce online updates and new releases only at certain times to prevent network congestion.   \"we really don't know how long we're going to be in this mode for,\" mr dave temkin, netflix's vice-president of network and systems infrastructure, said in a webinar on wednesday (march 25) on how the coronavirus could affect internet infrastructure.   internet service providers like comcast, vodafone, verizon and telefonica have been building out their networks for years to account for increasing demand. but company officials said they had never seen such a steep, sudden surge.   growth that the industry had expected to take a year is happening over days, said mr enrique blanco, chief technology officer at telefonica, a spanish telecommunications company.   \"in \njust two days, we grew all the traffic we had planned for 2020,\" mr blanco said.   on monday, traffic on at&t's networks was up 27 per cent compared with\u00a0the same day last month, and last week verizon experienced a 22 per cent increase in traffic on its wireless and fibre broadband service. wi-fi calls doubled from their normal volume, the carriers said.   in europe, internet traffic into homes over fixed lines was up more than 30 per cent, according to telefonica. activities like online gaming and video conferencing have more than doubled, while messages over whatsapp have more than quadrupled.   so much traffic and stress on internet networks has slowed the speed of downloading webpages and apps, according to ookla.   \"congestion is higher,\" said ms adriane blum, an ookla spokesman. \"we're all at home and the activities we're doing in this unprecedented time are not low-bandwidth usage, which means a lot of activity on a network.\"   cisco said demand for its webex teleconference service had tracked the spread of the coronavirus. demand first surged in asia, then in europe, and last week it soared 240 per cent in the us.   the demand has pushed up failure rates delivering video conferencing, said mr sri srinivasan, a cisco senior vice-president in charge of webex.   \"i don't know if we'll soon see a peak, not for weeks to come,\" he said. \"the reason i say that is because we aren't seeing traffic in asia slow down even now.\"   internet service providers said they could handle the deluge of traffic but were adding capacity. verizon, cox and at&t said they were building more cell sites to strengthen mobile networks, increasing the number of fibre connections on their network backbones, and upgrading the routing and switching technology that lets devices talk to one another and share an internet connection.   orange, formerly france telecom, has doubled its capacity inside undersea internet cables. in italy, where home internet use is up 90 per cent, telecom italia said its technicians continued to make repairs and add capacity. vodafone, one of europe's largest networks operators, said it had increased its capacity 50 per cent in recent weeks through a mix of software and the addition of more equipment in the field.   \"we're seeing some signs of stress,\" at&t\u00a0chief executive\u00a0randall stephenson\u00a0said in an interview on cnn on sunday. \"we're having to go out and do some augmentation of networks, and so we're sending our employees out there to get that done, but right now the network is performing quite well.\"   to prevent clogged networks, europe has taken the most aggressive steps.   last week, mr breton, discussed reducing the bitstreams of videos with mr reed hastings, the chief executive of netflix; mr sundar pichai, the chief executive of google; and ms susan wojcicki, the head of youtube. the companies agreed, as did amazon for its prime video streaming service and twitch, its online gaming platform.   many of the companies then went further. on \ntuesday, netflix decided to switch its high-definition video streams in india, australia and latin america to slightly lower quality to reduce the traffic they create there by 25 per cent, and youtube said it would make all global streams standard definition.   \"we continue to work closely with governments and network operators around the globe to do our part to minimise stress on the system during this unprecedented situation,\" youtube said in a statement.   microsoft's xbox gaming business recently asked large gaming companies to release online updates of their games during off-peak hours while it helped focus on the critical internet needs of people involved in the coronavirus crisis, according to an xbox email reviewed by the new york times. video game updates can require great amounts of bandwidth to download.   xbox asked the companies to release updates in a four-hour overnight window in north america, and only from monday through thursday.   \"microsoft is actively monitoring performance and usage trends to ensure we're optimising service for our customers worldwide, and accommodating new growth and demand,\" the company said. \"at the same time, these are unprecedented times, and we're also taking proactive steps to plan for these high-usage periods.\"   while us regulators said they did not plan to follow europe in asking for streaming and social media companies to degrade their services, they are taking other steps. last week, the federal communications commission granted verizon, at&t and t-mobile temporary access to more airwaves.   \"the fcc has been coordinating closely with network operators to ensure those networks remain up and running,\" mr ajit pai, the agency's chairman, said in a statement.   telefonica's mr blanco, who has been living under a lockdown in spain, said he expected the record traffic to last for some time. it may even become the new normal, he said.   in spain, internet use drops only at 8pm, when people across the country go to their windows to cheer health workers and others who are helping to manage the crisis.   \"suddenly at 8pm it goes down;\u00a0then it goes back up,\" mr blanco said. \"it's a beautiful thing.\" ", "label": 1}, {"content": "india shifts diplomats in herat, jalalabad to

The World Health Organization (WHO) postponed to this Thursday the decision on whether the new pneumonia virus is a global public health emergency. During this Wednesday, the WHO Emergency Committee was reunited in Geneva, Switzerland, but Tedros Adhanom Ghebriesus - Director General of WHO - announced at the beginning of the night which was still a greater deliberation on existing data. If it is declared a global emergency of public health, it will be the fifth time this happens in recent years. More than 540 cases of this viral pneumonia are already confirmed in China - a new coronavirus (designated by 2019-NCOV) - and 17 deaths. At the press conference this Wednesday at night, Tedros Adhanom GhreyeSus began to say that this is an \"emerging and complex\" situation and praised the detailed presentation of the data made by China. Despite saying that there was \"an excellent discussion\" during the meeting of this Wednesday, he stated that it is \"I need more information.\" \"I decided to ask the emergency committee to meet again tomorrow afternoon [this Thursday] to continue the discussion,\" he said. To justify it, WHO director pointed out: \"The decision on whether or not a global public health emergency is something that I take extremely seriously and that I am only prepared to do with an appropriate consideration of all evidence.\" In turn, Mike Ryan (director of the WHO Emergency Program) stressed that public health actions need not begin with the global emergency public health statement. \"These actions are already well under way.\" Alerted even that the priority is to find the origin of how the virus is being transmitted among people. \"The main question is to limit human transmission to human.\" Already Maria Van Kerkhove, an interim chief of the WHO emerging diseases unit, has yet reported that there is evidence that person's transmission is transmitted for close contacts, such as family care or healthcare environments. \"This is not something unexpected in a respiratory disease. But we have no proof that a subsequent transmission is occurring as a third or fourth generation, \"he said, adding that a secondary level of transmission in countries where the virus was exported either. That is, from an infected person who traveled from China to another country and there has been a new infection. According to WHO, a global public health emergency is defined as a \"exceptional situation that is determined by constituting a public health risk for other states due to the international transmission of the disease and, potentially, requires a coordinated response to international level \". All this means that in this case the situation is considered serious, sudden, unexpected and requires immediate action at the global level. The official investigation \nFrom this viral pneumonia began on 31 December 2019, when WHO representation in China was informed of cases of an unknown cause pneumonia. These cases had been detected in the city of Wuhan in the Chinese province of Hubei. Soon the next day a fish market and live animals in Wuhan was closed, where the outbreak began to be detected, according to the Municipal Health Commission of Wuhan. Preliminary investigations had revealed that some cases were diagnosed in workers or visitors who attended the market, \"where they sell wildlife\", the Reuters Agency marks. WHO refers even that the source of this outbreak is likely to be an animal. The marketing of living birds and wildlife in the city was prohibited. On 9 January, the first death related to the outbreak was registered: a 61-year-old man with other associated health problems. And on 10 January, the authorities announced that the virus was a new coronavirus, a virus group that causes respiratory infections in humans and animals and is transmitted by air (through cough or sneezing) or by physical contact. If some coronaviruses are only in a constipation, others may cause more serious respiratory diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Andrew Rambaut, evolutionary biologist at the University of Edinburgh (Scotland), quoted in a news in Science magazine, published on his Twitter that this new coronavirus has a similarity with SARS at about 89%. The last surge of Sars began also in China and, between 2002 and 2003, more than 8000 cases were recorded and 800 deaths around the world. Chinese health authorities also confirmed that the new coronavirus is transmissible among humans. The symptoms of this pneumonia include fever, cough, shortness of air or difficulties in breathing. Cited by the BBC, Li Bin - Deputy Minister of China's National Health Commission - said in a press conference that there is evidence that the disease was \"mainly transmitted through the respiratory tract,\" but that it has not yet been able to know what is the its exact origin. The British newspaper The Guardian also highlights that they are the poorest people who run a higher risk of being infected. In China, there are already cases in large population centers such as Shanghai, Macau, Hong Kong and Beijing. On 13 January, the first case outside the country was announced: was detected in Thailand. In the meantime, people infected in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States have been identified. The passage from the virus to the United States was identified in a 30-year-old man residing in the state of Washington after returning from a trip to Wuhan, according to the centers for the control and prevention of US diseases.

There are already more than 540 cases of infected people (including health professionals) and 17 \ndeaths. Based on travel to Wuhan, a group of scientists from the Imperial College of London estimated that there are already 4000 cases of people infected with the new Coronavirus in Wuhan. There are also some fear that this viral pneumonia can spread even more during the Festivities of the Chinese Lunar New Year, which begins next Friday (January 24). This is a time when millions of Chinese travel due to celebrations. The authorities of the country have already appealed to people do not travel to and from Wuhan. \"Basically, do not go to Wuhan. Already those who are in Wuhan do not leave the city, please, \"he asked Li Bin. Chinese authorities have also assumed that the country is now \"in its most critical state\" prevention and control of the virus. The last time the WHO declared a global public health emergency was in 2019 for the outbreak of Ebola virus, which is still underway in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has already killed more than 2000 people. The WHO also considered as international public health emergencies the following epidemics: in 2016, the Zika virus; In 2014, the previous Ebola outbreak in West Africa and killed more than 11,000 people between 2014 and 2016; In 2014, poliomyelitis; In 2009, swine flu (the H1N1 virus).

trend in s\u2019pore experts worry about imported cases from outside china. singapore \u2014 although it is still far too early to say the worst is over, the covid-19 outbreak appears to have tapered off in singapore in the past week, several experts said on friday (feb 21), four weeks after the coronavirus was first confirmed here.   however, there is a growing concern that further cases of the infection could arrive from countries outside china and disrupt this recent positive streak, four infectious health diseases experts said in giving their take on the broad covid-19 picture to date.   since the peak of confirmed cases a week ago, when nine cases were confirmed here in one day, feb 14, experts noted that the number of new cases detected has fallen steadily, although there is no way to be certain that another surge will not happen.   on both thursday and friday only one new confirmed case of covid-19 in singapore was reported by the ministry of health (moh).   on wednesday, three cases were reported, including a 57-year-old woman who had initially been admitted to hospital for dengue fever. it was later confirmed she had both covid-19 and dengue.   no new clusters of local transmission have been detected for several days and most of the latest cases can all be traced back to earlier ones. a large number of patients confirmed with the disease have\u00a0been discharged from the hospitals where they had been isolated.   \u201cthe hysteria will quieten down in the next month unless something unexpected happens,\"\u00a0professor tikki elka pangestu, a visiting fellow at the lee kuan yew school of public policy and a former director of the world health organization\u2019s (who) research policy and co-operation department in geneva told today.   \"but, as i have said, the virus will most likely remain in the population. in my view? normalise everything and learn to live with the virus,\u201d he added.   recent reports from china, where the disease covid-19 originated, have suggested that new transmission of the virus that causes it, sars-cov-2, has also fallen dramatically over the last few days.   referring to this trend, who director-general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus had said that chinese data \u201cappears to show a decline in new cases\u2019\u2019 but noted that any apparent trend \u201cmust be interpreted very cautiously\u201d.   using data made available by the singapore moh, today looked at how the pace of the covid-19 outbreak has changed over the past four weeks since case 1, a 66-year-old wuhan resident who arrived in singapore on jan 20 and was confirmed with the disease on jan 23.   downward trend in the number of cases in past week      looking at the daily number of confirmed cases, the covid-19 situation appears to have slowed in the past week, with a sharp drop in the number of cases from the record of nine on feb 14 to one confirmed case on friday.   dr leong hoe nam, an infectious diseases specialist at mount elizabeth hospital, said it \nlooks like the number of cases found on feb 13 and 14, mostly arising from the grace assembly of god cluster, appears to be the peak of the outbreak in singapore.   \"the number of cases is coming down,\u201d said dr leong.   he noted that singapore has been doing hundreds of polymerase chain reaction (pcr) tests per day \u2014 the test used to detect covid-19 \u2014 and these cases must be seen in that context.   \u201cthis means that we are truly looking for a needle in the haystack, which means the number of cases is truly low. there are very few, if not no cases of active transmission in singapore,\u201d he said.   agreeing with dr leong, dr pangestu said that the supposed peak outbreak here on feb 14 is consistent with earlier scientific models that predicted that the number of new infections of the covid-19 virus would peak in mid to late february. chinese scientist zhong nanshan, the eminent 83-year-old epidemiologist who had discovered the sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus, had given the same prediction as well.   one study by the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine had predicted a february peak based on the basic reproductive number of covid-19, which is the expected number of cases directly generated by one patient. for covid-19, this number averages between 1.5 and 4.5.   biostatistician alex cook, who is the vice dean of research at the saw swee hock school of public health, said it is \u201ccertainly a good thing that the number of cases has been going down\u201d.   \u201c(this falling trend) reflects the cases to identify and be isolated, and the efforts of moh to conduct contact tracing, and healthcare workers to minimise infection in hospitals,\u201d said associate professor cook, who is the domain leader for biostatistics and modelling at the school.   his colleague, associate professor hsu li yang, the school\u2019s programme leader of infectious diseases and the co-director of global health, added that the fall in the number of confirmed cases in the past week indicates that singapore\u2019s efforts have been successful in limiting the spread of covid-19.   \u201cit is likely that current massive contact tracing \u2014 initiated right at the start of the outbreak in singapore \u2014 has led to the majority of cases being uncovered. current quarantine and social distancing measures have also worked to reduce transmission in singapore,\u201d said assoc prof hsu.   fewer new primary cases detected in recent weeks      a key indicator is the number of primary cases found on a given day \u2014 patients who have had no known link to previous cases and could have contracted the virus through local transmission.   singapore upgraded its disease outbreak response system condition (dorscon) alert level to orange on feb 7 when it discovered another three such primary cases, including case 32, a victoria junior college teacher who had no recent travel history to china and no known link to the earlier cases.   while finding these primary cases helps the authorities discover new ones through \ncontact-tracing, they also highlight that there are more unknowns about how the covid-19 situation is spreading in the community, said experts.   but in the past week, no new cluster and fewer primary cases have appeared. the exceptions are the recently discovered case 82, a 57-year-old singaporean who had contracted both dengue and covid-19, and case 85, a 35-year-old chinese national who did not travel to china recently.   as these cases were confirmed only recently, a link could be established later when more detailed contact tracing has taken place.   commenting on this trend of fewer primary cases in the past week, prof pangestu said he hoped this would help to calm the public.   while it could also mean that potential primary cases are still hidden from view, it is unlikely as the singapore government has been \u201cvery vigilant\u201d in contact tracing. the trend shows that infected people have been effectively detected, isolated and treated.   \u201cit\u2019s the nature of these epidemics \u2014 they start explosively and then run out of steam as public health measures kick in and the virus runs out of susceptible hosts.\u201d   dr leong noted that with singapore expanding its case definitions to screen all patients with pneumonia for covid-19, it is unlikely that cases would fall under the radar.   but singapore\u2019s strengths in contact tracing will still be limited by the ability for patients to recall where they have been and with whom they have interacted, which could account for those cases with no known links, he said.   \u201clousy recollection means lousy contact tracing, which leads to lousy curtailment. we need to think out of the box,\u201d said dr leong, suggesting that there should be a mobile phone application that is able to help build singapore\u2019s capability in contact tracing in future.   large portion of earlier cases discharged      experts also noted that a majority of the cases detected in the first two weeks of the outbreak have been discharged, a trend that is similar to the experience in other countries. this high rate of discharges is also a sign that the covid-19 situation is improving in singapore.   as of friday, 47 out of the 86 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. the number of cases in critical condition \u2014 five currently \u2014 has also come down.   the number of discharged cases does not include covid-19 patients who do not suffer from any symptoms throughout their infection but are still hospitalised.   assoc prof hsu noted that in this regard, data published out of china and other countries has\u00a0been similar.   \u201ccovid-19 infections are mild for more than 80 per cent of patients, which means these patients would not have needed hospitalisation based on medical needs alone. the patients were kept isolated in hospital to minimise the risk that they would spread the virus to others in the community,\u201d he said.   while there is no known vaccine for the disease yet, in singapore and elsewhere, covid-19 patients \nare treated with a mix of antiviral drugs normally used for hiv cases, such as ritonavir and lopinavir. these have been promising, professor tan chorh chuan, moh\u2019s chief health scientist said previously.   besides singapore becoming more adept at treating covid-19, there is also the chance that the virus could be turning milder which would explain why the newer cases are not so severe, said dr leong.   of the cases in china, covid-19 has a mortality rate of around 2.3 per cent. by comparison, sars had a mortality rate of 9.6 per cent during the 2003 outbreak, while middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) has a fatality rate of 35 per cent.   the mortality rate of covid-19 outside china \u2014 based on a small number of deaths \u2014 is lower still, at around 0.2 per cent, which is similar to swine flu and slightly above the seasonal flu.   prof pangestu added: \u201cthe implication of this? it simply proves that most cases of covid-19 are not severe and people should not be unduly concerned. it\u2019s just like the flu and zika.\u201d   majority of cases with no link to china      however, a concerning statistic has emerged in recent weeks: cases that cannot be traced back to mainland china have now exceeded those with a known link to china, said experts.   dr leong said while it is no cause for alarm, the fact that a majority of cases have no link to china shows how close singapore came to losing the ability to contain the viral spread from china.   he said strong contact tracing helped to rein in the numbers, otherwise the unknown cases would continue to mount.   \u201cthe first round of infection comes from china. the second round comes from locals who were infected with contact with the chinese. that is expected in any ongoing epidemic. it is crucial to keep the lid on the second group and we seem to have done it,\u201d said dr leong.   but the experts suggested that something more surreptitious could be at play given the mounting travel restrictions against china. there is a growing concern that undetected cases of covid-19 may be entering singapore from other countries.   said dr leong: \u201cwithin china, the numbers are coming down and it is good that viral spread in the source (country) is being controlled. but the more important question is those who have left china and seeded to countries with less resources \u2014 can they take the heat?\u201d   covid-19 cases outside china are growing at an accelerating rate. the number of new cases detected outside china climbed at a steady rate since feb 7, and crossed the threshold of 100 new daily cases for the first time on feb 17 and has remained high ever since.   while the number of imported cases of covid-19 in singapore has\u00a0been negligible after singapore put in place border control measures, assoc prof cook predicts that this could climb again, with increasing numbers of imports from other countries seeding more clusters in singapore.   \u201cin normal times there is a lot of travel to and from singapore and places like japan and thailand, \nboth of which have quite large numbers of confirmed cases,\u201d he said.   given singapore\u2019s close proximity and connections to malaysia and indonesia, assoc prof cook said he is also concerned about the risk of future importation from these two nations. indonesia has zero detected cases of covid-19, though a harvard study had questioned whether this was due to its lack of detection rather than the incidence of the virus.   \u201cwith more cases being observed beyond china it looks far too early to celebrate,\u201d said assoc prof cook.

known by its technical name 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov).   passengers are facing screening measures at five us airports and a host of transport hubs across asia.   european airports from london to moscow have also stepped up checks and nigeria, which has many citizens working in china, said it would start checks at entry points.   virus source   the who has confirmed that the virus can be passed between people, at least those in close contact.   however, animals are suspected to be the primary source of the outbreak.   a wuhan market is believed to be the epicentre of the outbreak.   a price list circulating online in china for a business there lists a menagerie of animals or animal-based products including live foxes, crocodiles, wolf puppies and rats. it also offered civets, the animal linked to sars.   \"we already know that the disease originated from a market which conducted illegal transaction of wild animals,\" said gao fu, director of the chinese centre for disease control and prevention.   he said it was clear \"this virus is adapting and mutating\".   hong kong and british scientists have estimated that between 1,300 and 1,700 people in wuhan may have been infected.   mask selling out   health authorities are urging people to wash their hands regularly, avoid crowded places, get plenty of fresh air and wear a mask if they have a cough.   anyone with a cough or fever was urged to go to hospital.      in wuhan, city authorities made it mandatory to wear a mask in public places on wednesday, according to state-run people's daily.   in response to skyrocketing demand for masks -\u00a0which were starting to sell out at pharmacies and on some popular websites -\u00a0china's industry and information technology ministry said it would \"spare no effort in increasing supply\", state media reported.   \"these days, i wear masks even in places that are not too crowded, although i wouldn't have done so in the past,\" said wang suping, 50, who works at a beijing arts school.   follow us on telegram for the latest updates: https://cna.asia/telegram ", "label": 1}, {"content": "We do not know what to get on us yet. It can already occur strange, which triggers this coronavirus. On the one hand, the media as time online report every day about increasing infection numbers, drastic quarantine measures in China, new suspected cases. And on the other hand, there are a lot of experts to speak that always repeat: in Germany, even in Europe, no one has to worry about. Is scanned panic in a set, just to recapture you in the next? No, the location is very complex and your outcome uncertain. Four reasons why this outbreak deserves our full attention. At the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities of the World Health Organization WHO reported an accumulation of pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause in the Central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the diseases. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days then a group released a group of the virologen Christian's premier from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 the first diagnostic test for the new virus, the researcher provisionally call 2019-NCOV. With the test, the virus can be detected in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, on which, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected. Both the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as well as Mers (MIDDLE East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses which have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more than 750 died. With the MERS virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronaviruses. Many of them relate to respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example. In China, several thousand persons are suffering from them, some of them - most of them with pre-existing conditions - have died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first infection cases outside of China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been in Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection with a tourist, who came back from Wuhan, on January 24, the first cases were known in France. Meanwhile, first cases were confirmed in Germany. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. The virus can cause pneumonia that can endally end. Since it is a viral illness, antibiotics do not help. Meanwhile, it is clear that the virus can be transferred from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transfers, after about one \nDozen cases were known in medical staff. Medizors assume that the virus is transmitted above all over droplet infection. The World Health Organization calculates, as announced on January 24, at the moment that an infected one cuts 1.4 to 2.5 other people. Contest these numbers, the virus is less contagious than SARS and also the viral flu. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals. That can not be said yet. The World Health Organization said on 28 January that about one-fifth of the reported cases through the virus will be seriously ill, so in case of doubt must be treated intensive care. According to reports, the first death pots were patients who had some severe pre-existing conditions. Even with other infectious diseases, people with pre-existing diseases are particularly endangered - for example at the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so change their genome. This can cause you to become more dangerous for people in the course of an outbreak - but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) expects no similar mortality to the current time as the outbreak of SARS. The coronavirus is probably not much worse than influenza viruses, presumably at the moment many and want to calm down. But this comparison is not a good one. First, the virus flu is by no means harmless. Anyone who has succumbed to themselves - a week high fever, tearing body pain, violent sweating at night, absolute energy-oscillating -, knows that. Every year thousands of people in Germany * on the consequences, in bad years more than 20,000. And yet the vaccination quotas are chronically low, because many, also unconsciously, believe to know the flu. Conversely, people tend to evaluate new dangers such as the quite unknown coronavirus. This can not be dissolved, especially not because it is reported about it. Of course, it could turn out that the 2019-NCOV is less bad than influenza savors. But what if the opposite is the case and how the closely related SARS virus every tenth that gets the diagnosis dies? What if media and authorities should not have informed intensively? Anyone who expresses the reproach of panicmaking should question themselves: why am I so sure that the virus is harmless? Experts are not. Nobody currently knows what to come to us. We still know little: Like many people, the infection with 2019-NCOV is heavy? How many do not have any symptoms? And are people already contagious if they have no symptoms yet? How contagious are sick? On all this, there are certain answers. the \nNext days will show: Most of the infected people in China have been infected in the past week. And these people still have the coarsest in front of them. The previous studies show that there is average about a week from the first symptoms to heavy pulmonary problems (The Lancet: Huang et al., 2020). That is: Very soon, thousands of Chinese patients come to the point that turns out if the disease is easy or heavy with them. From the 100 dead will soon become more. Just like many, just nobody knows. At the same time that means: nobody, who rises in Germany in a subway and grabs after a holding bar, must worry. There is no killer virus, there is no reason to assume that in this country in a few days the hospitals will overflow. A handful of cases in Germany do not change the situation. And even if it's more, which is likely, there is no reason to panic. Because who has spoken online and the time with experts - from the airport skill across the virology professor to the federal authorities such as the Robert Koch Institute - which offers a clear picture: all are prepared, all know what who who who has When to do, nobody underestimates this virus. And it seems to all played at the first four cases, which were reported on January 28 in Bavaria, for the time being all smooth. In the shortest time they were tested after it was clear that a colleague from China, which was visited, was infected. And a few hours after the first test was positive, there were already 40 contact persons found and contacted. * Editor's note: Of course, this number referred to Germany. We have specified this subsequently in the text. So it is less the first case in Germany that deserves our attention. What you can watch this day, especially in China, is a world-historical event that affects millions of people: travel bans, locked streets, train stations and airports, tagged major events, closed schools and universities, mouth shift. It is an outbreak of the superlative, which is full of first male, full of things that have never happened before. Everything in real time. A new virus appears on the world stage, in a city, in which eleven million people live. Rasant spreads, thousands of infected people are known within a few weeks, the real number is likely to be significantly higher. But the same way is the answer of the Chinese and scientists and researchers worldwide: It only takes days to discover and decrypt the virus for Chinese researchers and scientists, and just two weeks until a test is available, with which they can prove it can. Within only few days, new findings follow: Calculate scientists and update the number of \nInfected doctors publish studies that describe the course of the disease, biologists try to understand genetic differences in the viral samples, how long the pathogen may already affect people. The outbreak impressively shows the great progress made in sciences such as evolutionary biology, virology, molecular biology or biotechnology in recent decades. The answer to 2019-NCOV from science and technology is so strong and diverse that is clear: humanity does not contribute helpless and defenseless to a new pathogen. And China has long since become a technological superpower. It is not only flies to the moon and has been massively investing in artificial intelligence for years, but can also build new hospitals with thousands of beds within a few days. Started in 2002, when the SARS virus broke out in China, a close relative of the new coronavirus, it took weeks until the authorities reacted adequately until they passed on to the World Health Organization and researchers worldwide. This time a lot of radically different seems different: from the beginning of the outbreak, China shared data. Information policy is also different from 2002 because the world is more networked. And China can no longer afford to preserve silence. The country invests trillion euros in international infrastructure projects: from the harbor in Greek Piraeus to the high-speed trains in Kenya. And for these paths, for example, the Pulitzer winner Laurie Garrett cares, pathogens like the Coronavirus could spare themselves faster than ever. Also in places where health systems have little to oppose the virus, in Subsahara Africa. If the Chinese authorities try to curb the coronavirus regionally or nationally, they do something for the whole world. Therefore, too, we should not lose this outbreak out of the look.

has grown even as rallies have paused due to the coronavirus outbreak, according to a survey conducted for reuters that also showed a widespread lack of confidence in the government's ability to manage the covid-19 crisis.    demands for the resignation of hong kong's leader, carrie lam, were supported by 63% of respondents in the poll, conducted by the hong kong public opinion research institute between march 17-20, versus 57% in a poll it conducted in december.    supporters of the protests outnumbered opponents by a ratio of roughly two to one, with 28% against them compared with 30% in a poll in december, and 58% supporting them, versus 59% previously.    the poll showed a significant increase in the levels of support for key demands of the often-violent demonstrations which rattled the city for most of last year and into early january before the coronavirus crisis.    the survey also showed a widespread lack of confidence in the government's coronavirus measures, with 54% expressing distrust and 33% giving the thumbs up.    the anti-government protests escalated in june 2019 over a since withdrawn bill that would have allowed extraditions of defendants to mainland china, and later morphed into a movement for greater democracy in the chinese-ruled city.    many protesters say beijing has used its authority under the \"one country, two systems\" formula, agreed when britain handed over the city to china in 1997, to undermine freedoms enjoyed in hong kong that are unavailable in the mainland.    \"it is understandable that protesters resort to extreme means,\" said patrick yeung, a 32-year-old it worker who responded to the survey. \"i hope beijing can meddle less in hong kong's affairs, which could actually stabilise hong kong and curb people's anger.\"    beijing denies meddling in hong kong and blames the west for fomenting unrest.    for more comments from respondents see.    lam's office and china's hong kong and macau affairs office, which comes under the state council, or cabinet, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.    support for universal suffrage in hong kong, a core demand of protesters aimed at strengthening the territory's level of autonomy, rose to 68% from 60% in december.    an independent commission of inquiry, which protesters want to look into how the police handled demonstrations, is now supported by 76% of respondents versus 74% previously.    the demands of the protesters \"haven't been diluted, or forgotten, due to the epidemic situation,\" said ma ngok, associate professor of government and public administration at chinese university of hong kong.    opposition to the demands of the protesters has remained virtually unchanged at 15%.    \"the government should investigate the culprits behind the political crisis and should not accede to other \ndemands from the protesters,\" said another respondent, ming hon, an unemployed 49-year-old who moved to hong kong from mainland china recently and had jobs in cleaning and construction.    for the poll, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points, 1,001 respondents were randomly surveyed by telephone in cantonese, which is spoken by the vast majority of people in hong kong. the results were weighted according to the latest population figures.       virus response    following a large rally on new year's day in which some protesters clashed with police, crowds on the streets have dropped from many thousands to a few hundred as hong kongers adopted social distancing to fight the coronavirus.    some recent protests focused on the government's decision not to fully close the border with mainland china, where the virus is believed to have originated. the administration has since banned all tourist arrivals.    although hong kong has won praise for limiting the outbreak to roughly 450 cases and four deaths, the poll showed that many citizens remain distrustful of the government.    \"the results in combating the pandemic are because of the self-discipline of hong kong people. the government has nothing to do with it,\" said evelyn lau, a 23-year-old tutor who participated in the poll.       opposition to independence    another key finding of the survey is that while calls for hong kong's independence from china grew within the margin of error, opposition to the idea has dropped significantly and indifference has increased dramatically.    support for independence rose from 17% in december to 20%, but opposition tumbled from 68% to 56%, and those not leaning either way doubled to 18%.    \"people talk more about it, so it becomes more easy to accept,\" said samson yuen, assistant professor in the political science department at lingnan university, referring to the independence issue. \"when people talk more about 'liberating hong kong', it shifts the frame.\"    with legislative council elections due in september, the pro-democracy/pro-beijing split remained virtually unchanged from last year's district council vote, with 58% saying they would vote for a pro-democracy candidate and 22% for a pro-beijing one, with the rest undecided or not planning to vote.    the degree of support for the protests varied sharply by age, education and whether respondents were born in hong kong. younger and better-educated people born in the city were far more likely to lean pro-democracy or support the protests.    the poll, the second in a series commissioned by reuters from the independent polling firm to gauge public sentiment amid the city's worst political crisis in decades, showed respondents mainly blamed lam's administration for the state of affairs.    some 43% of respondents primarily blamed the hong kong government, compared with 47% in the previous poll, while 14% blamed the central government in beijing versus 12% in december. the police \nand protesters were blamed by about 10% each in both polls.    many protesters say they are incensed by what they see as an abuse of power by the police in dealing with the unrest. the police say they have used reasonable and appropriate force against illegal acts including vandalism and rioting.    china has denounced acts of violence in the protests, which it sees as being aimed at undermining chinese sovereignty. reuters ", "label": 1}, {"content": "No friday prayer

At the apparent highlight of his power abundance, the most powerful authoritarian regime of the world is shaken by a virus. This country, the People's Republic of China under Xi Jinping, is on the way to leading worldwide in the development of quantum computers and artificial intelligence, it has excellent telecommunication technology, the fastest trains of the world, well-trained officials and a prestigious virus research. But all this takes little to the new coronavirus. Its propagation sets the weaknesses of the system now mercilessly. The bureaucratic health system of China was not prepared in such a case. Overloaded hospitals meadow patients and patients, at first poorly protected doctors and farmers suffered themselves at the coronavirus. And the question is long ago, whereby the Chinese central government in the past few weeks was actually more efficient: in the control of the outbreak - or rather in the control of the population and the flow of information? In times of social media, especially in China, where WeiChat and Weibo instead of Facebook and Twitter are the big platforms, now shows: Information shared by users and users social-media can be used with the means of censorship and erasure Only conditionally control. These users are especially from the younger ones, in the eighties or then born generation, whose members have never experienced such a chaos. These younger ones have grown up in the most economically happiest decades of Chinese history and have benefited from the growing prosperity, which, above all, their parents have developed, and who owes themselves in widths of globalization, from which China has benefited so unprecedented as a production site. These young Chinese women have so far familiarized to communist authorities. Their poor response to the threat of the new coronavirus now shakes this faith. In the crisis, the younger ones mobilize a previously unknown energy for self-help - and they also often organize them about social media. They provide breathing masks and bring hospitals; They provide medical staff cars; They help old and patients who are standing at home and try to support refugees from Hubei. Under great efforts, civil society is trying to fill the gap, the defective action of the authorities and their obvious excess of the virus outbreak. The existence of social media \nPlatforms at the same time enables something completely different: just thanks to them, the attempt can be made to reconstruct the events since the emergence of the new coronavirus in China, as largely not reported in the state media; Also a report by Human Rights Watch, which was published on 30 January supports these research. These show how insufficient or even the authorities traded at local and centralized level until at least mid-January. The history of spread this virus began just under one and a half months like many catastrophes in China - as a rumor. As the middle, at the end of December in the 14 million city of Wuhan in a hospital took increasingly patients with identical symptoms, the doctors reported the cases to the local center for disease benefits, a semi-official site. According to social media posts, their officials appeared on December 27 \"very impatient\" in the local hospital and listened to the concerns of the doctors with great reluctance. Three days later, on 30 December 2019, this pension guide internally communicated that all hospitals are to prepare for an \"unknown pulmonary disease\", whereby the doctors is \"strict forbidden\" to give information to the public. The authority itself did not inform the public. Doctors who have not worked directly into the departments for fever and lung diseases were left over the possible seriousness of the situation in the dark - they were therefore unprotected in dealing with possible Corona patients. How serious the situation was actually, many of them later experienced their own body. In the afternoon and evening this day, several doctors from different hospitals posted in their chat groups and on Wechat diagnoses of their patients and expressed their concern about the inaction of the pension authority. They warned colleagues from the dangers that went out of the local fish and wildlife market, which was soon suspected as an outbreak sort. Doctors also said that the symptoms of propagating pulmonary disease reminded of those of SARS, the highly initial, life-threatening infectious disease, which had spread from South China at the end of 2002 in early 2003. This information and internal authority communication came to the public, screenshots from the chats spread viral. User started using the Hashtag Wuhansar. Your posts were quickly deleted from censorship. On the morning of December 31, one of the doctors, which had publicly made the information on the new coronavirus, was scheduled by the Municipal Health Commission of Wuhan, the Supreme Health Authority of the City, short WMHC. He had to disclose his sources. Tags, the party secretary office from the doctor requested an apology for the \"Spreading of rumors\" and also the \nAssurance, from now on nothing more \"leaking\". Then he had to accept and announce a warning to the police. On the same day, official media representatives at WMHC reported to receive a confirmation of the \"rumors\" circulating for several days. Under the growing pressure, the WMHC was forced to give a public explanation; The number of 27 cases of Corona infection was officially confirmed. As a result, the Supreme Chinese Health Authority, the NHC in Beijing, sent an expert group to Wuhan. At the latest, the customer had arrived from a possibly mass-promoting disease in the Chinese capital. Meanwhile, high-operations continued to continue on the fish and wildlife market of Wuhan. A journalist interviewed the dealers - nobody had heard of the virus so far. There were further wildlife sold. Only after the appearance of this report on the government-related news page First Finance from Shanghai, the market was closed on 1 January 2020. At this time, there were already eight persons, against which the \"spread of rumors\" was determined by the viral disease police. Message spokes announced the arrests on the local and central government channels such as China Central TV with strict expression: \"The Internet is not a right-free room!\" About what alleged rumors had spread the supposed malefactors, no word was lost. Finally, on January 11th, the initial attended physician. Diagnosis: pneumonia. The coronavirus? Also more than two weeks later - the doctor was still strongly impaired physically - given him allegedly no information about the medical examination results on his own body. Many infected patients, it has just been passed. Of the people already confirmed more than 200 people died in the consequences of the Coronavirus in China, many often did not know many, which they were even ill at least. The Chinese government hindered the search for the truth for a long time with ever new fogging tactics. Official organs threw the public only small information, doubtful statistics, mixed with increasingly angry resolutions, the \"war against the disease\". A case of obvious coverage is about the fact that Wuhan's city government reported no new infection cases from 3 to 15 January as if the virus had been held by magic. Experienced observers could look through the magic: it was coincidentally the days, while in the city of the People's Congress of Hubei province was held (Wuhan is the capital of Hubei). It was the same game as at the beginning of the SARS crisis of 2002/2003: At that time, the government in Beijing had the epidemic \nFor months, steadfastly denied to the \"stability\" in the environment of the National People's Congress in Beijing in the spring. 17 years have passed since, without really passing. An article in the specialist magazine The Lancet did retroactively on January 24, that on January 2, 41 hospital patients in Wuhan laboratory-finished infections with the Virus named in 2019-NCOV. Five days before this publication, the head of the wuhan, Wang Guangfa, before journalists had declared that the new coronavirus was \"not very contagious\", the risk of a transfer of person to person is \"low\". The disease is \"preventing and dominating\". Where Wang Guangfa referred to his information and whether he did not know it myself better, can not be said. Two days after the press conference, in any case, he suffered itself at this not very infectious illness. And People's Daily reported online, the cause of the diseases is not fixed yet, it is still open whether it is SARS or, which is more likely, a less dangerous disease. \"But even if it's SARS, we have a sophisticated pension and control system. For people in Wuhan there is no reason to panic.\" The inhabitants of the city were calmed down and continued their holiday preparations. In the coming weeks, five million of them swarmed to spend the late New Year celebration with their families starting at the end of January. Thousands traveled abroad. Meanwhile, the social media has increasingly posted posts in which people reported on strange diseases of their relatives or acquaintances in Beijing, Changsha, Shenzhen, Wenzhou - in all China, including soon in Japan and Thailand. The Chinese media froze. Nobody dared to readjust these new cases. In the state media, a loose tone prevailed, and in the short reports on the disease, the competence of the government was highlighted and optimism spread. Only in Hong Kong one has taken the location very early seriously. On January 4, seven suspicions of illness have been reported there. The government has taken place immediately strict precautions, with great transparency in information policy. The relatively independent press played an important role. The TV channels reported around the clock. Journalists and journalists were sent to Chinese mainland to assess research; However, some of them were again thrown out from there or asked about the police. Already on January 7, Starry Lee, chairman of the Beijing-loyal party Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, then traveled to the Chinese capital and asked the central government to improve the flow of information around the epidemic. Among the relevant reports in \nOnline media made government trolls and patriots thereafter over them: \"Then do not demonstrate! Your Hong Konger makes so much pollution!\" Almost a little bit hide and scolded, the governments of the Province Hubei and the city of Wuhan still stopped further all sorts of galas and events to celebrate the Chinese New Year's festival. Start of January 18, the city organized a feast for 40,000 families that cooked together and ate. The participants apparently believed in the official slogans: trust the government! Nobody seemed to be aware that the coronavirus could celebrate a feast. On January 19, the state media suddenly announced with great Tamtam the return of a now 84-year-old hero from the fight against SARS in 2003: Zhong Nanshan, lung specialist and former chairman of the Chinese Medical Association, on medicine propagandistic battlefield ordered. He managed to squeeze himself in the south-facing Guangzhou in the dining car of a quick train. He was listed in Wuhan and immediately traveled to Beijing the next day to report the health authority. On January 20, he confessed from journalists that the transfer of the virus of humans to person was possible and at that time already 14 representatives of the medical personally were infected. According to this explosive interview, he appeared. Now only the media decided to ignore the evil existing muzzle of government. Brave journalists and journalists of the few left over traditional media traveled to Wuhan to research locally. Many online breeds confirmed: The hospitals were actually overloaded and had to reject numerous patients, doctors and sisters were ill, officials had lied and refurbished, there was apparently not enough test kits to test all patients on the virus. It had been involved in the official news, the hospitals had been delivered at least 100,000 of these test kits, and 4,000 beds are ready for patients, while the number of confirmed infections and suspected cases have been stated with three digits. But where were these test kits and hospital beds? And where was the \"sufficient amount\" on masks, gloves and protective clothing? How could the plowed calls of respected hospitals explained from all over China to donate all this? What about the heartbreaking requests of children in the social media, which are desperately looking for treatment options for their parents, grandparents and themselves? Who are the people in the online videos that simply tip over on the street Ober during the scratching in the hospital? What about the young woman who tries in vain to a post to the other \nBring to take care of the body of your grandmother at home? What about the doctor who breaks up and roars: \"Way with those that lie in the hall!\" Immediately! \"? With the social media viral video of the nurse, which cries hysterically in your lunch break? For other government agencies apparently had time and money: The best telecommunications technology in the world should have been used to monitor all mobile users of Hubei province and report the number of visitors from the vulnerable region to other provinces. Some local authorities should also have passed on their names, addresses and identification numbers. Travelers from Hubei were rejected in hotels. Some were mistaken on open road, were rejected or even beaten, is reported. The local authorities prepared accommodations for the non-welcome refugee, but then failed to communicate people where the accommodations were found. The people have now recognized the logic (or unlogic) of the \"fight against the virus\": in hospitals, even from the recorded patients and patients, only one part was tested on the virus. The number of confirmed infections, for example, in the face of the tremendous setting measures, for example, in Wuhan (now, this has been officially grown in China to more than 17,000 people) is at least partially explained by it - and as well as this obviously rejected many sickness and not only were treated. The data and statistics transmitted from China to the Coronavirus should only be given to believe in any way with reservation. In the Chinese network, the patient and their relatives, if they express themselves on social media, are now harassed by trolls. These throw diseases, they are simulators or fines, demands evidence of their emergency and then discredit this evidence. Exemplary is the case of a young woman who, like her father and her grandmother, is infected and rejected by a hospital. She asked for help on Weibo. Thousands of hate comments collected under her mail. She plenated and magic, then found only the word \"deceased\" on her account. The government maintains a zombie army from paid hate commentators. Not all trolls are included, but the associated culture feeds their hatred. The leader of the nation and creator of the \"dream of China\", the chairman Xi Jinping, has so far neither visited Wuhan nor any of the hospitals in the country, in which people were treated on coronavirus. Instead, he held a vague and bread speech in which he signaled fighting, but also \"stability and the great vision\" emphasized his government. Even the \"epidemic pension team\", which was late on January 27, was not Xi before, but Prime Minister Li Keqiang. only after a meeting \nWith the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Xi continued to go to the top. For many Chinese and Chinese, this is a time of \"excess of truth\". You can not possibly list all that you had to experience in the past few weeks. But one thing is certain: the image of the Chinese government as the epitome of efficiency, unlimited resources and unaskable authority to which the government has worked for decades, is severely struck. Meanwhile, some fear a total breakdown of the Chinese economy through the epidemic. So big the resilience of the Chinese leadership may be - it shows for the first time for a long crack. These could get bigger. Because the share capital of the government, as unfairly it may be acquired is in danger: In view of the threat of a virus, many people now recognize that propaganda is not a medical remedy.

xi jinping made his first visit to wuhan, hubei\u2019s capital, since the coronavirus outbreak began there more than two months ago. it was a signal that china has largely won the fight against the epidemic.   on wednesday, the hubei government issued a notice asking companies to resume operations in an orderly manner, although residents are still restricted from leaving the province. hubei has been divided into three categories \u2014\u00a0with regions classified as high, middle and low risk.   companies in low-risk regions can gradually resume business, while in \nhigh-risk areas, companies involved in epidemic prevention and control, public services and supply of daily necessities are allowed to reopen.   for the medical staff who have been fighting the virus in wuhan, these are welcome signs that the day they can return to their own homes is approaching.   tian xi, 33, a volunteer with the china biodiversity conservation and green development foundation in beijing, went to wuhan on the first day of the lunar new year \u2013 two days after the city went into lockdown.   he has been helping organisations deliver medical supplies to hospitals \u2013 five times a day during the peak of the epidemic \u2013 as well as sending patients and doctors to hospitals and delivering masks to residents. in the past weeks he has seen despairing people jump from a bridge in

China continues attempts to tackle the contagion by the new Coronavirus that has already caused at least 41 deaths, according to the latest data updated by Bloomberg, and has infected more than 1,100 people in this country and another 16 in other nations, according to the data More recent. In addition to quarantine and close transportation in Wuhan - the epicenter of the crisis - and another dozen cities in its surroundings, as it affects more than 41 million people, plan to build clock, to be ready in just 10 days , a new hospital in Wuhan that will centralize the treatment to those patients. The Hospital, as reported by CCTV state television, will be built on the western periphery of that city of 11 million people, along with what was a rest resort for workers in its day. The works began on Thursday and are expected to be completed on Monday, February 3. The idea of \u200b\u200braising a newly built hospital and deriving there those infected by the coronavirus reproduces what was done in 2003 during the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), related to the current coronavirus Wuhan 2019 -Cov and left more than 700 dead. Then, Beijing ordered building a specialized clinic, that of Xiaotangshang, on the outskirts north of the capital. About 7,000 workers took only one week to build it. Although the initial idea was to dedicate these facilities to take care of the convalescents of SARS and thus alleviate the pressure on other hospitals, Xiaotangshang ended up treating about 700 patients in the acute phase of the disease, a seventh part of the total infected. The hospital became famous for reducing mortality among its patients at 1.18% (only eight of the patients died), which made him win the nickname of \"The Ark of Noah\". The World Health Organization (WHO) has calculated the mortality rate by that syndrome by 9.6%. The new Wuhan Hospital will have capacity for a thousand beds, according to the official newspaper of the city, the Changjiang newspaper. To accelerate the works, it has opted for prefabricated modules. \"By using those materials, not only will it be built fast, but its cost will be quite economical,\" says the newspaper. With the new facilities, it is intended to alleviate the pressure on the rest of the Hospitals of the city, already completely overflowed by the epidemic: the main health care centers have requested this Friday donations of all kinds of protective material, from disposable sanitary masks to Surgical glasses and robes. According to publishes the State Property Newspaper The Paper Hospitals only have this type of equipment for the next three or five days. While the city accelerates the construction work of the \nHospital - and the Government of the province where it is, Hubei, has requested financial assistance to the central government to fight against the crisis -, the number of infected does not stop growing. In the last 24 hours, the National Health Commission has confirmed the first two deaths by Coronavirus outside Hubei. The first of them, in Hebei Province (northern China), was a 80-year-old man who had spent two months in that city. The second has been recorded in the distant province of Heilongjiang, on the border with Russia in the Northeast Chinese. On the night of this Friday, the Bloomberg agency, citing a statement from the authorities of Hubei province, adding another 15 fatal victims, with which the number of deaths by this virus is already 41. According to the economic magazine Caixin, That cites medical sources in Wuhan, the health personnel of that city calculates that the number of affected will come to surround the 6,000. Although until now, most of the mortal victims are over 70 who had already suffered other ailments, this Friday has also been confirmed the death of a 36-year-old man who did not suffer any chronic disease. This patient, from the province of Hubei, had been admitted on January 9 with a diagnosis of pneumonia. He died this Thursday. So far, and as a precautionary measure to reduce the transmission of Coronavirus, Wuhan and a dozen nearby cities have been quarantined and closed their transport networks. The origin of the virus, which causes atypical pneumonia characterized by high fever and difficulty breathing among other symptoms, is circumscribed to a Wuhan market where wild animals were sold. The outbreak of the epidemic has coincided with the travel season for the Lunar New Year, the largest annual population movement of the world and in which it is estimated that there will be about 3,000 million displacements, which increases the possibility of expansion of the virus . Cases have already been detected in at least eight more countries: Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Nepal and the United States. In all of China, preventive measures are expanded. Before the celebration of the Lunar New Year this Saturday, most of the cities have canceled the public acts where I could concentrate public. \"People have to be careful not to participate in agglomerations and stay at home as much as possible during the celebrations of the year New, to protect themselves, \"has recommended in an interview issued by CCTV, the Director of the Chinese Disease Control and Prevention Center, Gao Fu.

fighting wuhan coronavirus with lessons from sars crisis. each week, today\u2019s long-running big read series delves into trends and issues that matter. this week, we look at singapore\u2019s preparedness in the early days of the wuhan coronavirus outbreak. this is a shortened version of the full feature, which can be found here.   singapore\u00a0\u2014\u00a0like many others on the frontline during the sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) pandemic in 2003, a family clinic in chua\u00a0chu kang faced difficulty getting the\u00a0 equipment needed to protect themselves from the killer virus.   despite aid from the authorities, dr tan tze lee, a general practitioner (gp) at the edinburgh clinic said it was still difficult for frontline healthcare workers to obtain supplies such as n95 respirators, sterile gloves and full-body gowns.\u00a0   by the time sars was contained in may 2003, it had infected 238 people and killed 33 in singapore. two in five of those infected had been healthcare workers.   everyone was not ready for the crisis, said dr tan, the president of the college of family physicians singapore.\u00a0   \u201cthe healthcare practitioners in singapore were ill-prepared, which resulted in sombre outcomes. since then, we have learnt our lesson and measures were instituted to prepare us for any future pandemic event. here we are today, ready to fight the 2019-ncov,\u201d he said.   the current outbreak of the wuhan coronavirus \u2014 or 2019-ncov, the world health organization\u2019s (who) temporary name for the virus \u2014 was first confirmed in singapore on jan 23. to date, all cases were imported, including a singaporean who was in wuhan, and there has been no evidence of community spread in the republic.\u00a0   the who has yet to declare the virus \u2014 which has spread to several countries \u2014 as a pandemic. nevertheless, it was declared a global health emergency on friday (jan 31).\u00a0   the first cases were reported in wuhan in china\u2019s hubei province and believed to be linked to the huanan seafood wholesale market, which sells live animals.\u00a0   at the heart of the city-state\u2019s response plan is the disease outbreak response system (dors), a crisis management plan which did not exist in 2003, but was drafted after sars and refined again in the wake of the swine flu (or h1n1) pandemic in 2009.\u00a0   while the plans are in place and some measures have kicked in, singapore\u2019s national strategy is still largely untested \u2014 since the wuhan coronavirus is believed to be in its early stages in the republic, medical experts and sars veterans told today.\u00a0   however, there are ample signs that the lessons from sars are being applied as singapore shores up its defences, they said. they believe that unlike during sars, singapore is far more ready now.   lessons learnt   sars, which first arrived in singapore in late february 2003 from hong kong, was initially an unknown. first diagnosed at tan tock seng hospital (ttsh), an moh task force was set up on two weeks later, after the world health organization (who) \nissued a global alert on the outbreak.   but the command and control structure was \u201cwholly inadequate\u201d in a crisis situation that was both fluid and unprecedented, one study in the austrian journal of south-east asian studies concluded in 2012.   the study by two researchers from the lee kuan yew school of public policy said that a response required \u201cmore than a medical approach since resources had to be drawn from a number of government agencies that did not fall under the rubric of the moh\u201d.   it took five weeks after the first case was reported before the bureaucracy adapted. on april 7, 2003, a national control structure was created in response to sars, comprising of a nine-member inter-ministerial committee led by then home affairs minister wong kan seng.   in the wuhan coronavirus outbreak, professor ooi eng eong, an infectious diseases expert and virologist at the saw swee hock school of public health, noted that a multi-ministry taskforce on the wuhan coronavirus was formed on jan 22, the same day when the first suspected case \u2014 which later turned out to be positive \u2014 emerged.   jointly chaired by health minister gan kim yong and national development minister lawrence wong, the taskforce comprises a cross-section of cabinet ministers spanning various portfolios.   as a result, there is a clearer chain of command, said dr chia shi-lu, a tanjong pagar grc member of parliament who chairs the governmental parliamentary committee on health.   singapore is not in the same position as it was in the initial stages of the sars outbreak in 2003, which then health minister lim hng kiang once described in parliament as \u201cflying blind\u201d.   dr tan yia swam, first vice-president of the singapore medical association (sma), said back then \u201cthere were too many unknowns, and precautions came too late, and too slowly\u201d.   this meant that policies and procedures regarding risk stratification, contact mapping, contact tracing, quarantine and others were developed on the fly as the epidemic erupted, she said. today, however, these protocols are already in place.   since 2003, singapore has beefed up its healthcare and isolation capacity since 2003, with new hospitals and the 330-bed national centre for infectious diseases.   experts noted that contingency plans have been put in place too \u2014 student hostels are converted into quarantine facilities in anticipation of future cases, and the outward bound school on pulau ubin has been marked as a possible quarantine site.   unlike during sars, which centralised treatments at ttsh, all public hospitals are capable of handling the wuhan virus today.   when it came to medical supplies, dr chia recalled how there was hardly a stockpile of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers then, such as n95 respirators which required a custom fitting. today, most healthcare workers, including new staff, already have their own gear.   the sma also met with the college of family physicians singapore over the chinese new year \nweekend to carry out \u201ccomplex logistics arrangements\u201d to ensure that there is a steady supply of surgical and n95 masks to replenish stocks for the frontline healthcare workers.   tricky balance in the face of imponderables   mr lawrence wong has called on singaporeans to be psychologically prepared that the wuhan virus could be worse than sars given the many \u201cimponderables\u201d and \u201cuncertainties\u201d regarding the infection, though he stressed that there is still no evidence of community spread of the disease in singapore.   over the past week, however, the first reports of human-to-human transmissions outside of china have surfaced in taiwan, japan, vietnam and germany.   mr lawrence wong said singapore\u2019s approach \u201cis to anticipate and move as swiftly as we can\u201d. \u201cbut every action we take really has to be based on evidence, data and international medical guidelines,\u201d he added.\u00a0   unlike sars, which impacted singapore when little was known about it, there is a greater understanding about the coronavirus such as the wuhan strain and sars.   but data gaps still exist, including information about the true epidemic potential of the virus, said professor tikki elka pangestu, a visiting fellow at the lee kuan yew school of public policy and a former director of the who\u2019s research policy and cooperation department in geneva.\u00a0   despite the data gaps, singapore has \u201creacted much more swiftly and comprehensively\u201d than in 2003, prof pangestu added. \u201ci think the singapore approach is the correct one given the current information and evidence available -- robust but not over-reactive, and flexible enough to accommodate new\u00a0 developments,\u201d he said.\u00a0   he noted that overreaction risks imposing an unjustifiable burden on the country, potentially impacting normal daily routines and the livelihoods of certain vulnerable segments of the population. underreaction, on the other hand, would lead to a more extensive spread of the virus.\u00a0   singapore\u2019s national strategy is flexible with the changing circumstances. for example, the plan recommends taking border control measures that would \u201cerr on the side of caution with more intense efforts until such time when the disease profile becomes clearer\u201d.   handling a psychological crisis\u00a0   although the memory of sars may have faded for some, experts say that the psychological lessons from it have remained until today, such that more singaporeans are aware of the need to cooperate with the authorities during a health crisis.\u00a0   for example, social media is rife with examples of singaporeans calling out bad actors, such as online sellers who hoard surgical masks to resell, or profiteering behaviour by certain businesses. the government has also acted quickly to combat such behaviour. \u00a0 but dr leong hoe nam, an infectious disease specialist at mount elizabeth novena hospital,\u00a0 believes that the prospect of another sars-like epidemic might lead to needless panic, or worse, \u201ckiasuism\u201d.\u00a0   in a viral outbreak, being \u201ckiasu\u201d meant that \npeople only think for themselves, preventing mutual cooperation from happening, he said.   urging singaporeans to do better, dr leong said they should be prepared for the viral outbreak but not overdo it. at the same time, singapore\u2019s national response has to preemptively address concerns that could lead to panic, he said.   dr chia believes that singaporeans are generally behaving in a rational way so far, based on his conversations with residents as an mp or his interactions with patients.   \u201cduring sars, there was a lot more fear and a sense of real danger for everyone. we had people trying to evade quarantine, refusing to cooperate or going for medical screening\u2026 but so far there are no cases of people who are trying to evade authorities, in other countries, yes, but not among singaporeans,\u201d he said.   stronger legislation\u00a0   the rise of social media, which was non-existent during sars, can also give rise to disinformation that fuels further panic.   compared with the sars crisis, singapore has more legislative levers now to deal with fake news and anti-social behaviour \u2014 the protection from online falsehoods and manipulation act being one of them.   changes to the infectious diseases act over the years have also given authorities greater powers to enforce orders to fight a gazetted outbreak, such as using \u201cphysical means\u201d to enforce a home quarantine order by bringing an absconder back to the place of isolation.   the breadth of such powers in singapore give authorities the ability to ensure that evasion tactics cannot happen again.   moral suasion and importance of public comms\u00a0   over a longer term, legislatives measures are less effective than instilling a voluntary sense of social etiquette and responsibility among the people.   having a buy-in from the public is especially essential when authorities need the public\u2019s support to carry out certain measures, noted prof pangestu.   this largely relies on public education as well as proper and accurate communication of risk, which is not always a guarantee considering the complex flow of information in a crisis situation.   professor chee yam cheng, the current president of the singapore medical council, wrote in 2003 that \u201cquick dissemination of information \u2013 and accurate information \u2013 is almost as important as transparency in a health emergency\u201d.   prof pangestu pointed out that public reaction is \u201chard to control especially with fake news on social media\u201d.\u00a0   \u201cthe idea that \u2018perception is reality, anything is the truth\u2019 often operates in this kind of (crisis) environment. that is why public risk communication is so important,\u201d he said ", "label": 1}, {"content": "japan services sector activity shrinks on coronavirus hit - pmi. tokyo - japan's services sector shrank at the fastest pace in nearly six years in

", "label": 1}, {"content": "in coronavirus outbreak, why covid-19 patients must not become super spreaders. coronavirus outbreak has been reported from 75 countries after originating in wuhan in china in mid-december, and first reporting in mid-january. sitting next to epicentre of coronavirus outbreak, india managed to keep covid-19 or coronavirus disease 2019 largely at bay for more than two months. now, at least 28 people have tested positive for covid-19, the union health minister harsh vardhan said. first three cases were reported from kerala in february. there were isolated and discharged after a successful treatment. india evacuated around 200 people from wuhan and kept them in quarantine at a camp in the outskirts of delhi. they too were released after 14 days of quarantine. when it seemed that india might have pulled out a miracle of sort in insulating itself from an international contagion, two fresh cases over the weekends shook up the nation. rush to medical stores became frantic in every major city and, hand sanitisers and face masks of all kinds became scarce once again. of the two cases, one was reported from delhi sending the media in alarm mode with government agencies asking people not to panic and follow advisory, most important of which requires keeping hands clean either with soap or alcohol-based sanitisers, minimise hand-face contact, staying away from infected persons and report to a hospital if there are symptoms such as sore throat, breathlessness combined with other indicators of flu. reporting to hospitals in case of symptoms is key to preventing further spread of coronavirus infection. scientists are yet to conclusively ascertain that how many healthy persons may be infected by one covid-19 patient. some covid-19 patients may infect more persons than other carriers. quarantine and isolation - depending on when the carrier reports contact with infected person or infection - is a must for such persons. covid-19 super spreader discovery of one such patient during the severe acute respiratory syndrome or sars outbreak in 2003 had led to use of the term, \"super spreader\", which is not officially recognised by government agencies or the world health organisation (who). in the case of coronavirus outbreak the first super spreader was identified in south korea. now, she is known as \"patient 31\" and is held responsible for spreading corornavirus to \"countless\" people. she is a member of a little known religious sect, shincheonji church of jesus. the seoul metropolitan government has filed a formal complaint against the shincheonji church of jesus, accusing it of murder. the reason is that the patient 31 continued to attend public gatherings including at restaurants, markets and church apparently ignoring the advice of doctors. the sentiment in south korea is that she should have taken her case seriously and presented herself to health authorities. the indian case in india, the prompt action in the initial stage by the kerala health authorities in \nshifting the first covid-19 patients to isolation and the indian government in keeping the wuhan evacuees in quarantine killed the chances of anyone turning into a super spreader. but with the reporting of fresh cases has revived the fear. the delhi coronavirus patient, a 45-year-old man, returned from a europe tour on february 25. he had been to italy on a road trip. italy is one of the worst-affected countries in the grip of coronavirus outbreak. but his screening could not be done at the airport as the government put italy on the watch-list only on february 26 when reports of coronavirus infection from the country became too frequent. on his return, he went about his daily routine as usual. he threw birthday party for his son, where students of two prominent schools in noida were also present. the two schools had now been shut. after a few days, when the man showed symptoms of covid-19, he reported to the ram manohar lohia hospital. the government authorities are still in the process of contact-tracing all those, this patient came in contact. six of his relatives from agra in uttar pradesh became coronavirus patients after he visited them upon his return from europe tour. ignorance is loss, not bliss the other patient is a software engineer, who works in bengaluru but belongs to hyderabad. he had been to dubai, where his coworkers were from hong kong, a country severely affected by coronavirus outbreak. he returned from dubai on february 19/20 and reported to his office. few days later, he took a bus to hyderabad, where he showed symptoms of covid-19 and approached a private hospital first. he was referred to a government hospital, where his coronavirus infection was confirmed. the government authorities are in the process of contact-tracing of all the people the infected techie might have come in contact with including the passengers of the bus. more than 100 people are being monitored for suspected coronavirus infection. covid-19 from italy guests the biggest case of coronavirus infection reported in india is of a group of italian tourists who arrived in rajasthan in the last week of february. the group had been travelling till a 69-year-man of the troupe was confirmed as a covid-19 patient. they went to places including agra. they were assisted by indian tour operators and guides. now, 15 of the italian group have tested positive and shifted to specialised camp in the outskirts of delhi. the authorities are on contact-tracing hunt to screen all those people who came in contact with this group and advise quarantine measures to all the suspects. a driver who was ferried the italian group has also tested positive for coronavirus. how not to be super spreader it is important to understand who can be a coronavirus carrier. practically, anyone who has come in direct or indirect contact with a covid-19 patient or carrier. normally, an infected person would show symptoms and once reported, the doctors would keep the patient in isolation. but some \nother persons, with robust immune system, may be able to suppress the symptoms and yet pass on the virus to people with vulnerable immunity. since the coronavirus spreader may not show symptoms due to strong immunity, he or she might continue to infect others, and become a super spreader. secondly, not every coronavirus carrier or patient houses same load of virus. those with greater load are capable of infecting greater number of people. each one of the covid-19 patients diagnosed in india was a potential super spreader. italian group remained unscreened and non-quarantined for far too long. the delhi man reported days after his visit to italy, and the country having been placed on the watchlist. reporting of his travel to italy on february 26 would have containing the spread of coronavirus, and saved even his own relatives. bengaluru techie too did not report to health authorities despite having come in contact with professionals from hong kong, which was already infested by covid-19. he was not screened, quarantined or isolated for days after he is suspected to have contracted coronavirus infection. reporting his contact with hong kong nationals would have saved several people in at least two cities - bengaluru and hyderabad - from the scare of possible coronavirus infection. all these covid-19 patients went ahead with their usual routine not realising that they could be coronavirus carriers, and potential super spreaders. it is time to report. remember the old saying, prevention is better than cure.

The new coronavirus spread from China has only been known for weeks. Most of what is currently published by scientists and reported by media is provisional. To understand the new virus is a process. Read here, which has previously been secured as it is likely and as even uncertain. The new virus is related to SARS and MERS The novel virus with the preliminary name 2019-NCOV is a pathogen from the family of coronaviruses. These viruses can infect people and different animals. In humans, they can trigger harmless colds up to fatal diseases. Coronaviruses are also causer of severe acute respiratory syndrome, shortly SARS, as well as Mers, which stands for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. During the largest SARS epidemic so far in 2002 and 2003, 774 people died worldwide. More than 800 people have died at Mers since 2012. Like his relatives, the new coronavirus 2019-NCOV can also trigger heavy pneumonia at infected part. Frequent symptoms are fever and coughing some infected people have few or no disease signs, other ills heavy or even dying on the consequences of pneumonia. Symptoms that are quite common to the first scientific publications are fever, cough and shortness of breath. But also muscle and headaches as well as diarrhea can occur (The Lancet: Chen et al., 2020). If medical professionals examine patients in the hospital by computed tomography, they in many cases see signs of double-sided pneumonia. The outbreak took its origin in Wuhan, starting from the Central Chinese city of Wuhan, the virus has continued to expand. There, the first cases in which people were infected with it were detected (The Lancet: Huang et al. 2020). Meanwhile, thousands of cases are known, most of them in China. However, more than 20 other states have now reported in 2019-NCOV infections. At the beginning of February, the first death was known outside China - in the Philippines. The World Health Organization (WHO) regularly publishes the current figures on the outbreak on your website. Whether a wild animal market was the origin of the outbreak is uncertain. The virus originally comes from bats Chinese scientists have investigated the genome of the new coronavirus in samples from lung secretions of infected patients. Accordingly, it is similar to the SARS Coronavirus, originally from bats, to about 79 percent (The Lancet: Lu et al., 2020). Moreover, 2019-NCOV is still closer to SARS-like viruses found in 2018 in bat mice. The genome was 88 percent identical in these cases. \"It is very sure that the virus is originally circulated in bat mice,\" says the virologist Jonas \nSchmidt-Chanasite from the Bernhard-Steint-Institut for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg. It is not secured directly from bats on humans. The virus is transferred similar to a flu the new pathogens becomes like other coronaviruses or the influenza virus, the flu region, probably transmitted primarily over the air. When an infected exhalation, niest or cough, it distributes microscopic droplets in the air that the virus can contain. In addition to this droplet infection, other transmission paths are conceivable: SARS, a closer relative of the new coronavirus, was also transmitted over surfaces to a lesser extent. This means that someone who snails into the hands, for example and then touches a door pawl, can infect another one, which takes up the same door pawn shortly thereafter and then fits his hand. \"Especially with freshly infected such lubrication infections are also in the current outbreak, not excluded,\" says Schmidt-Chanasite. But you proceed from a droplet infection as a main transmission path. This is that the new coronavirus is a filled virus. Such viruses are usually less stable in the environment, so it is unlikely that they survive for a long time on surfaces. Older and pre-patients seem to be particularly endangered to his first data suggest that the virus makes particularly elderly creating. With an analysis of the first 425 confirmed cases, almost every second patient was 60 years or older (The New England Journal of Medicine: Li et al., 2020, PDF). And: men seem to be more affected after first findings than women. In the study of Li and colleagues, 56 percent were male, even 67 percent (The Lancet: Chen et al., 2020) in another with 99 in a hospital in Wuhan. Each second of the 99 patients also suffered from a chronic disease, especially the cardiovascular system or the brain vessels. According to researchers, therefore, older men with pre-existence could be a special risk group. Children are obviously not particularly at risk Amazingly seldom seem to be affected by children from the infection with 2019-NCOV. Under the first 425 confirmed infected goods were not under 15-year-olds (The New England Journal of Medicine: Li et al., 2020, PDF). Whether you are less prone to the virus or have fewer complaints is still unclear. \"Normally, children are over-represented on airway viruses,\" said the virologist Christian's suffro of Frankfurter General Sunday newspaper. That means: Normally one would expect more infections among children. Why it is obviously different at SARS, MERS and the new coronavirus, do not be clear. Most recently, it became known that an infected employee of Webasto has infected its two children. However, they are in the Bavarian Ministry of Health \nHealth stable condition. Currently there is no reason to assume that children - especially without chronic pre-existing conditions - are particularly at risk for infection with 2019-NCOV or their consequences. The incubation time is about the incubation period is the time between the infection and the occurrence of the first symptoms. According to current data, it is about five days (The New England Journal of Medicine: Li et al., 2020, PDF). However, it can obviously be only two or up to 14 days. However, how many have infected, no one can say even if there were more infected daily and recorded in the WHO statistics: no one knows how many people actually have infected with the new coronavirus. This is also because many people with mild symptoms do not even go to a doctor or hospital. Of course, you will not dive in any statistics. And not everyone who can go to the doctor with symptoms of flu or bronchitis symptoms, and should be tested for the current regulations on the new pathogen. Experts like Christian Drosten, virologist at the Charit\u00e9 in Berlin and one of the discoverers of the SARS virus, assume that there are still much more people infected than previously known. A team of the University of Hong Kong (The Lancet: Wu et al., 2020) has in a scenario considering the previously confirmed cases, air traffic and traffic flows in Central China, that in the Greater Wuhan until January 25, more than 75,000 people could have infected. However, a calculation is associated with many uncertainties at the present time. Since there is little known about the new virus, the researchers could feed their computer model only with coarse assumptions. \"How strong the virus will spread depends crucially on how quarantine measures affect China,\" says Hamburg virologist Schmidt-Chanasite. If they were really so strictly adhered to how many times it is reported, he will be able to curb the outbreak. \"But it's hard to estimate.\" How fatally the virus is, it will be further explored to find out how high the mortality is through an infection with 2019-NCOV, you have to know two things. First, how many people are infected? And secondly: how many die? On both there are - now in the middle of the outbreak - no secure answer yet. The proportion of deceased under the previously registered infected infected is so far at about two percent. For a respiratory duct infection, this would be a very high proportion. However, experts expect that the two percent will be significantly reduced in the course of the outbreak, the more people are tested. Because among them will certainly be many with a mild course that otherwise not tested, so not statistically recorded. However, the two percent were previously as \n\"Amazingly stable\" prove, Schmidt-Chanasit said online for time. He expects the number to sink earlier. That it is not the case, but also lies because not all tests are evaluated. This could lead to an overestimation of mortality. For example, during the pandemic with the influenzavirus H1N1 in 2009 and 2010. In the beginning, it was at the beginning of 59 deaths at 850 suspected cases and thus an extremely high mortality of seven percent. When more data were available later, death rate decreased to less than 0.1 percent. Whether the death rate will develop similar to the current outbreak, further data must show. Good possible that the outbreak started in November The Chinese authorities reported the first cases of novel lung disease to the World Health Organization WHO at the end of December 2019. However, Chinese scientists report that at least one patient was already positively tested on the new virus on 1 December (The Lancet: Huang et al. 2020). He could have already infected in November. It suits that previously examined virus samples are genetically much resemble, that is, they are very likely to go back to a common ancestor. Researchers conclude that this virus could have jumped over a person in a single event in November or December and has since been transferred to man. So it could be that the epidemic used to be reported many times. Patient Zero does not have to be infected on the market the first person who infected at an animal, the Coronavirus does not have captured itself on the Huanan Seafood Market. In such markets, living animals are offered, including fish, seafood, poultry, but also wild birds, rats or snakes. What was sold exactly in the market in Wuhan is unclear - just as if he was the place of origin of the outbreak. It is certain: The market has played a central role: from 99 patients treated at the beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan because of an infection with the coronavirus, 49 contact with the market (The Lancet: Chen et al., 2020). Most had worked there, for example as a seller or manager. Experts have it possible for the market that the market is not the place where the first animal man transfer happened. The patient who has already been positively tested on 2019-NCOV on the first of December had no contact with the market. \"It would be possible, for example, that an animal was slaughtered and parts of it were sold on the market but parts elsewhere,\" says Schmidt-Chanasite. So it would be possible that a person infected elsewhere and infected more people on the market. The fact that a person introduces the virus to there and then only more people or even animals has infected, on the other hand, is not plausible. Who patient \nis zero of the outbreak, so remains unclear - just as if infected in the market. Whether bats of humans directly infected people is unclear is that large parts of the virus bodies are identical to viruses that are infected with bats. The previous results at least do not talk about that the virus could have jumped directly from bats to humans, virologist Schmidt-Chanasit said. But it could also have given an intermediate host - a further species of animal so that were infected with bats and then infected people again. In the case of SARS and MERS, there were such an intermediate host. At SARS, there were creeps, at Mers Dromedare. The Chinese researchers around Lu are also in this case. You write: \"Although our pedigree analyzes suggest that bats are the original host of these viruses, could have an animal that was sold on the fish market in Wuhan.\" In his work, the team also writes that no bats were sold in the market in Wuhan, but without calling a source (The Lancet: Lu et al., 2020). Nobody knows the possible intermediate host should have given it an intermediate host, so it must be a mammal, says Schmidt-Chanasite. The immune system of a reptile - for example, a snake - is not similar to the bat and humans that a transfer by snakes is plausible. \"The barrier jump from a bat on a snake and then on humans would be too big,\" says the virologist. \"That's absolutely unlikely.\" But you do not know the exact type of species, you can not just reading them out of the virus material. One possibility would be to test animals in the Wuhan region on viruses and examine how similar to the samples are from the patients. But it can also be, SCHMIDT-CHANASIT says that a possible intermediate host was only briefly infected. \"Not all animals of this kind must wear the pathogen.\" That makes it all the harder to identify the possible intermediate host. It could also be that you can never find out. Blood, sperm or fecalities as a transmission path are not excluded in addition to the infection due to droplets in sneezing or coughing would also be conceivable that one infects about other body fluids. At least in the excrements of some infected remains of the inheritance of the pathogen could be proven, such as in stool samples (New England Journal of Medicine: Holshue et al., 2020). However, the infection on feces seems, if at all, compared to the droplets a much smaller role to play. Unlike SARS, fewer people seem to suffer from diarrhea in the new coronavirus: Sars were probably ten to 20 percent. of 99 patients treated in a clinic in Wuhan because of the new coronavirus \nOnly two diarrhea (The Lancet: Chen et al., 2020). \"In addition, a positive virus detection in the chair or anal string does not necessarily mean that the virus has still lived and others could infect,\" gives virologist Schmidt-Chanasite. This proof is still out. However, it is possible that 2019-NCOV could multiply not only in the lungs, but also in the intestine and in other parts of the body. \"That too would not be unusual.\" You can determine this by examining the tissues of the patient deceased as a result of the virus. Also Peter Collignon, Medical Professor at the University of Canberra, does not constitute infection for the magendar tract. The message platform Bloomberg he said, \"We have to be unbiased.\" Unknown is in which phases infected contagious are whether people can infect other people during incubation time, although they even have no complaints, could decide how the outbreak goes on. The first case in Germany first suggested that it could be. During a business trip, a Chinesin is to have infected an employee of the car supplier Webasto in Bavaria, although they have not yet noticed any symptoms - as scientists posted on January 30 in a report in New England Journal of Medicine (Rothe et al., 2020). Meanwhile, it has been found that this information was obviously wrong. According to a report in the magazine science, the authors did not ask the woman himself whether they had complaints during their stay in Germany, but initially rely on statements of several webasto staff. Only later, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) and the Bavarian State Office for Health and Food Safety contacted the woman in Shanghai and learned of her that she had mild symptoms. This confirmed the RKI online over time. Accordingly, the patient had nonspecific complaints such as back pain and have taken a fever-lowering drug. The RKI then initiates a correction of publication in the New England Journal of Medicine. It does not mean that there is no asymptomatic transmission, there are only no secured findings. The WHO based on the previous data assumes that the virus is mainly distributed by infected, which also have complaints. However, it is still insufficiently explored to what extent people who feel about only slight cold symptoms are already contagious. More about the new coronavirus, its possible origin and epidemic.

After having been criticized from several countries, Beijing admitted, on Tuesday, need to \"improve the national emergency management system\" not to deal with the best of the outbreak of the new coronavirus. The number of dead in China rose to 425, according to the last balance sheet disclosed by the Chinese health authorities on Tuesday. After a meeting of the Permanent Committee of the Politburo, the most powerful organ of Chinese politics, chaired by Xi Jinping, Beijing admitted that improvements were necessary after the \"gaps and difficulties exposed in the response to the epidemic,\" quotes the state news agency Xinhua. \"We need to improve our emergency management system and improve our capabilities to carry out urgent and dangerous tasks.\" \"It is necessary to increase supervision in markets, and banish and punish wildlife markets,\" adds the same news, quoted by BBC. On Monday, the Chinese government had admitted some shortcomings caused by the new coronavirus outbreak (known as 2019-NCOV): lack medical equipment, surgical masks, facts and protective glasses. Although the Chinese factories are capable of producing 20 million protection masks per day, they are only operating at 60% -70% of their ability due to the Chinese New Year holidays - and are not being able to respond to demand, especially after Of several provinces they have decreed, in recent weeks, the mandatory use of masks. \"Currently, we are not in a pandemic situation\" Clarifies Sylvie Briand, Director of the Department of Global Preparation for the Infectious Health Risks of the World Health Organization, in statements to the present media. The term applies to a global dissemination situation of a disease, which, for now, is discarded by WHO. The number of dead has returned to increase on Tuesday. Of the 425 deaths since the end of December in China, 414 occurred in the province of Hubei, where on Tuesday there was a record of deaths in a single day: 64. Hong Kong recorded the first death by Coronavirus. The victim was a 39-year-old man who had health problems. According to the territory authorities, the man traveled by train to Wuhan, the center of the outbreak of 2019-Ncov, on January 21, and returned to Hong Kong on January 23. The public broadcaster of Hong Kong, Rthk, indicated that last week the man had muscle aches and fever. Later, \"was transferred to an insulation ala after confirmation of coronavirus.\" Counting on this death and with that of a citizen of the Philippines on Sunday, the overall number of deaths amounts to 427. The number of infected also increased. There are more than 20,000 infected only in China. Overall, 151 cases were detected in 23 countries and regions - among them Belgium, the last country to register a positive case of Coronavirus. This is a \nWoman, no symptoms, which was part of the group of nine Belgians who were repatriated, needs Le Soir. The virus has already killed more in China than the SARS epidemic (severe acute respiratory syndrome). However, the mortality rate is lower: in the case of the new coronavirus is 2.1%, according to the National Chinese Health Commission. In Hubei, outbreak epicenter, the rate is slightly higher: 3.1%. It was in this province that approximately 97% of all deaths were registered. In the case of SARS was 10%. By comparison, seasonal flu has a mortality rate of less than 1% and should cause about 400,000 deaths around the world per year, according to the data presented by The Guardian. Of more than 400 deaths confirmed by coronavirus in China, 80% of the victims were more than 60 years and 75% had other diseases other than coronavirus. Two-thirds of the victims were male, adds Jiao Yahui, Deputy Director of State Administration of Health, quoted by CNN. On average, a patient needs nine days to fully recover. In Hubei, as there are more cases and less means to treat them, recovery time is higher: 20 days. According to the University of Johns Hopkins University data, it has been updating the numbers relating to this virus , 684 people recovered after they have been diagnosed with the new coronavirus. The National Chinese Health Commission states that it is possible to recover from less serious symptoms in just a week the most severe cases have emerged in older patients. The records show that the younger patient has only one month of life and is in stable condition. There are other children infected with the new coronavirus, most in stable situation, writes the SCMP. Despite this, health officials advised pregnant women and children to adopt more intense protection measures. On Tuesday, Japanese authorities are testing the more than 3700 passengers and crew of the Diamond Princess cruise, which are prevented from leaving the vessel a day ago. The ship is serving as a quarantine place in the port of Yokohama, about an hour from Tokyo. The alert was given after a passenger traveling on the vessel in January had a positive result to a test to coronavirus. According to Reuters, passengers are waiting in the rooms and, according to the images on social networks, there are not many who try to leave. Everyone will be subjected to a medical test and whoever has a fever or is feeling evil will be tested. Only after that is that the authorities will decide who will let leave the vessel. Several countries are closing boundaries or prohibiting the arrival of travelers who have been in China. This is the case of Taiwan, which will begin to forbid the arrival of foreigners who stepped Chinese territory in the last 14 days from this Friday. This prohibition does not apply to citizens living in Hong Kong or Macau, the Minister of Business \nTaiwan foreigners, on Tuesday, quoted by South China Morning Post. Hong Kong declared the closure of borders last Monday and Macao can follow the steps. The Chief of the Macao Executive who has admitted that the territory is considering to close the borders with China, but for just only the temporary closure of the casinos, for two weeks, following two more confirmed cases of the new coronavirus, one of them An employee of a casino. Macau now registers ten confirmed cases. Ho Iat Seng also stated that the closure of borders is a difficult decision because it has to assess the impact on the supply of food to the territory and at the daily routine of many Macao residents and many territory workers living in China. The person responsible also appealed to the population so that he does not leave home and \"reduce to the maximum commercial activities,\" writes the Agency Lusa. The Consulate General of Portugal in Macau and Hong Kong advised the Portuguese community to follow the guidelines of the territory authorities in the context of prevention measures to the new Chinese coronavirus. The health ministers of the G7 countries (US, Germany, Japan, United Kingdom, Canada, France and Italy) had a telephone meeting on Monday and decided that they will jointly coordinate the regulations to be applied to travelers, research and cooperation with the World Health Organization (WHO). The US had already closed their borders to travelers who had been in China and ordered to the diplomatic corps that came out of the country. Beijing accused Washington to promote and foster panic by taking that decision, which goes against WHO's recommendations. Several nations, such as Portugal, withdrew the nationals of the areas affected in China, placing them quarantined upon arrival. The authorities of Malaysia and Thailand have withdrew tens of citizens of the Chinese city of Wuhan, center of the outbreak of the new coronavirus, currently under quarantine.

In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, renal failure or even death, according to WHO. According to a study published in the scientific journal the Lancet, analyzing at least 99 cases of the new coronavirus treated at the Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan between 1 and 20 January at least 46 people had been in the Wuhan fish market. The mean age of the infected is 55.5 years and most were male. The most common symptoms are fever and cough. At least 11 of those infected in this hospital died due to the bankruptcy of organs.

Efforts to find a cure, or at least one effective medicine against the effects of the new coronavirus, multiply at the pace of pandemic. And, in addition to a race to vaccines (China, Germany, United States), hopes have now seen for a medicine that is 70 years old: chloroquine, used to prevent and treat certain types of malaria. With one advantage: it is a cheap and relatively simple medicine to produce. Approved in Portugal by Infarmed, \"Chloroquine is an antiparasitic agent belonging to the group of antimalarial medicines.\" And where does the hope come from? of converging news arriving from various geographies.\nIn Marseille, south of France, a group of doctors said he has presented good results in the use of the medicine in patients hospitalized with Covid-19. In a test involving 36 of these patients, chloroquine at 20 and between these, 70% had negative analyzes to the new coronavirus past six days. This percentage of cured is well above what happened to the group that did not take the medicine - only 12.5% \u200b\u200brecovered.\nThe fact that chlorine being tested should not surprise, says Andrew Preston, a microbiology specialist, the British \"The Telegraph.\" It is that the antiviral effects of the medicinal product had already had an effect on the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which began in Asia in 2003. Chloroquine \"was relatively little attention when the SARS outbreak died. Recognizing that the current virus is a close relative, several researchers are testing if chloroquine can be a therapeutic for the current pandemic, \"says the same specialist. And although the Marseille test does not serve as proof of efficacy, even because it was done with a small number of patients, the news comes to join others in the same direction.\nIn Wuhan, Chinese city where the pandemic started, a laboratory study made by the Institute of Virology, placed chloroquine as \"highly effective\" in control of Cuvid-19 infection. In the United States, at the University of Minnesota, a group of non-sick volunteers, but who have been in contact with infected patients, will be exposed to the active substance to realize if Cuvid-19 advances. In Australia have also been conducted tests with similar results. And the World Health Organization itself included the medicine as one of the priorities of the \"Solidarity Trial\" (\"Solidarity\") project, a study, and an international effort to find an effective remedy.\nIf it depends on Biopharma, anti-malarium can even be the solution. The multinational group of companies had communicated a series of development and research projects to combat the crisis caused by Covid, and the pharmaceutical Bayer took a step forward, announcing the donation of three million tablets of chloroquine to the US, so that the tests Advance.\nThere are also no shortage of voices in favor of this solution. At the beginning of the week, the Multimillionaire Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, caught the attention on Twitter for a study of three American researchers, James Todaro, the University of Columbia, Gregory Rigano, Johns Hopkins, and Thomas Broker of Stanford , in which chlorine is pointed to \"an effective treatment for coronavirus\".\nMusk added that another article in the same direction \"beat right\" with much of what has heard to say \"smart people.\" Despite what we hear is not recognized as a scientific fact, Musk reminded his experience with the medicine, which saved him from a \"right death\" when he contract malaria. \"Maybe it's worth considering chloroquine,\" he wrote.\nAlso James Todaro, one of the study researchers quoted by Musk, has used Twitter to congratulate themselves with research advances. And with the support she will receive. This Thursday, the American President Donald Trump called for Celeraity to the Federal Medicines Agency (Food and Drug Administration) in the approval of medicines to treat Cuvid-19 patients.

One is clear that the coronavirus will have impact. \"You can see that on the supply chain,\" he stressed. Many providers are affected at least for individual components.\nDepending on the product category, the bottlenecks would be felt different quickly - because of the delivery routes.

The duration around the five weeks, and currently there are still devices built, which were built before the beginning of the coronavirus turbulence. For smartphones, which are often transported by plane, the bottlenecks are faster noticeable.\n\"One or the other dealers can use the shortage to sell more expensive in the business embossed by price declines, Kamp said the German Press Agency.\nDue to the coronavirus effects, no serious sales forecast for the current year in the consumer electronics business was possible, Kamp said. At the same time, however, he expects a buried demand that unloads later. \"We have a market shaped by high replacement purchases. That is, when Coronavirus has occurred sometime, then these replacement purchases are made. \"Surveys were still a high quality of the consumer.\nAt the same time, Kamp does not believe in significant positive effects of coronavirus crisis for its industry - for example, if more companies are gripping to video conferencing instead of business trips.

since january 1990 when reuters records started, and a sharp reversal of the 6.9% growth in december. the median forecast of analysts polled by reuters was for a rise of 1.5%, though estimates varied widely. the dire numbers also showed shocking weakness in the property sector and have prompted some analysts to further cut their forecasts on first-quarter economic performance, which were already pointing to a dramatic slowdown. they may also mean beijing needs to rethink its economic growth target for 2020. china has yet to publicly issue its target, which would ordinarily be announced at the start of the annual parliament meeting. that meeting was originally scheduled for march 5 but was postponed due to the outbreak. sources have said policymakers are debating whether to lower the planned annual growth target of around 6%, which was tentatively agreed late last year. the global times on monday quoted wei jianguo, vice head of the china centre for international economic exchanges, a think-tank, as saying that china's 6% growth goal for 2020 remained intact. however, many private-sector economists see that as already well beyond china's reach. \"don't even think about it,\" said hao hong, head of research at bocom international. \"even though china goes all in with stimulating policies in the property sector and infrastructure, that's still mission impossible.\" questionable prognosis the nbs in a statement on monday said the impact from the coronavirus epidemic is controllable and short-term and that authorities would strengthen pro-growth policies. mainland china has seen an overall drop in new coronavirus infections, but major cities such as beijing and shanghai continued to wrestle with cases involving infected travellers arriving from abroad, which could undermine china's virus fighting efforts. however, \nanalysts warn it could take months before the economy returns to normal. \"while domestic conditions should improve slowly in the coming months, the mounting global disruption from the coronavirus will hold back the pace of recovery,\" said julian evans-pritchard, senior china economist at capital economics. prior to a significant deterioration in the virus, analysts had predicted a rapid v-shaped recovery for china's economy, similar to that seen after the sars epidemic in 2003-2004. but the outbreak escalated just as many businesses were closing for the long lunar new year holidays in late january, and widespread restrictions on transportation and personal travel, as well as mass quarantine, delayed their reopening for weeks. factories may not be back to full output until april, some analysts estimate, and consumer confidence may take even longer to recover. more support needed the declines in industrial production, urban investment and retail sales indicators contrasted with gains in december and expectations in a reuters poll for very modest growth. investment slumped 24.5% in january-february year-on-year while private sector investment dived 26.4%. retail sales shrank 20.5% as consumers shunned crowded places like shopping malls, restaurants and movie theatres. china's jobless rate rose to 6.2% in february, up from 5.2% in december and hitting the highest since official records were published. pain was also seen in china's real estate market with property investment falling at its fastest pace on record while home prices stalled for the first time in nearly five years. analysts expect march figures to be even worse. despite those numbers, nbs spokesman mao shengyong said short-term policies

up until feb 19 last week, the number of confirmed cases hovered below 100, but it skyrocketed from feb 20 onwards to where it is now.   coming under the spotlight and linked closely to the outbreak in south korea is the shincheonji church of jesus, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony \u2014 a secretive sect that claims to be christian and is based in daegu city where around 64 per cent of the country\u2019s infections have sprung.\u00a0   how did the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory symptoms such as pneumonia get out of control so quickly in south korea, claiming 13

which 1,132 have been sickened by the virus as of thursday afternoon.   the city, located in the north gyeongsang province, is also the base of operations for the shincheonji church. shincheonji means \"new heaven and earth\" in korean.   american news channel cnn reported on thursday that the south korean authorities believe a large number of cases in the country attended a service at shincheonji church or have been in contact with attendees.   british newspaper the guardian reported that more than six in 10 of the people infected are linked to the church.\u00a0   patient 31 and her movements   the shincheonji cluster began with patient 31, a 61-year-old woman who developed a fever on feb 10 and went to at least four services in daegu before being diagnosed, news agency afp reported.   several media reports said that the woman did not get herself tested for the coronavirus because she had not travelled overseas and simply thought that she had caught the common cold.   during the course of two weekends, she came into contact with more than 1,000 churchgoers.   detailing the chronology of events involving patient 31, bloomberg reported that she first checked into the saeronan chinese medicine hospital on feb 7 due to headaches after being involved in a car accident the day before.   the hospital said that at the time, she did not have any fever, cough or respiratory symptoms.   on her third day in the hospital, she developed a fever and went for a flu test, which came back negative.   kcdc said that she left the hospital on feb 10 for two hours to attend a morning service at shincheonji church.   south korea\u2019s health authorities also said that she had lunch with a friend at a hotel in eastern daegu on feb 15 and attended another \nworship service at shincheonji on feb 16.   it is common in south korea for hospital patients to come and go, and they have even been seen venturing out while wearing hospital garb and wheeling intravenous drips alongside them, bloomberg reported.   on feb 17, patient 31 was finally confirmed to have covid-19. that day, her condition worsened and a scan showed she had signs of pneumonia. this prompted the doctors to test her for the coronavirus.   illness \u2018not valid reason\u2019 for missing service   a former member of the shincheonji church told cnn that illness was \u201cnever accepted as a valid reason to miss services\u201d.   attendance was monitored through a roll call, and churchgoers would have to use a special card to swipe in and out of the venue.   the number of confirmed cases started multiplying exponentially shortly after patient 31 was diagnosed and shot past 1,000 by wednesday, which prompted the government to raise its health alert to the highest level.   health officials in south korea still do not know how she was infected and how she spread the virus to fellow shincheonji members.   professor kim chang-yup, who researches on health policy at seoul national university, told bloomberg that what made the case worse was that patient 31 spent a considerable amount of time in a crowded areas.   followers in the sect would sit on the floor \"packed together like sardines\u201d during services that last hours, cnn reported.   various media reports have pointed to the church\u2019s connection to the city of wuhan, the epicentre of the virus outbreak in china.   shincheonji members held meetings in wuhan until december, stopping only when they realised that their community in south korea had been hit by covid-19, hong kong daily south china morning post reported.   a funeral and a hospital\u00a0   the south korean authorities are also trying to determine whether patient 31 is connected to an outbreak at another hospital outside daegu, where a funeral for the brother of the sect\u2019s leader was held earlier this month.   afp reported that between jan 31 and feb 2, an unknown number of members came together for the funeral, which was said to have been held at cheongdo daenam hospital.   the hospital is the second hot spot for the virus within south korea, with at least 114 cases. more than half of the fatalities in the country are linked to the hospital.   shincheonji members are known for proselytising in secret and not revealing their identities, which makes it hard for people to know if they have been in contact with a member, afp reported.   however, mounting public anger has forced the church to hand over a list of 212,000 members to the authorities to enable them to be checked for covid-19 symptoms.   previously, the church had boasted that it had more than 240,000 members, raising doubts over the accuracy of the roster.   despite the\u00a0large number of cases in daegu city and cheongdo county, the south korean government has yet to forcibly control the movement of \npeople from these areas or ban visitors from china, the new york times reported.   from wednesday, singapore has imposed restrictions on new visitors who have travelled to cheongdo county or daegu city in the past 14 days.   this means that travellers\u00a0from the two places will not be allowed to enter or transit through singapore.

", "label": 1}, {"content": "How genetics can help monitor coronaviruses. A new coronavirus with epicenter in Wuhan, China, has been scaring the world. Already killed more than 100 people and infected thousands of them. How can genetics be used to supervise viruses like this and observe how they spread? In an article published this Wednesday in the scientific journal MSPHERE - of the American Society for Microbiology - a team of scientists describes an improvement in the genetic sequencing of new generation to monitor coronavirus, especially those who originate in bats.\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses living in animals like birds or bats. They can transmit from animals to people, but most coronavirus strains only circulate between animals and do not infect humans. If they come to humans, they can cause respiratory diseases, from a constipation to more serious situations to such a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the new coronavirus (2019-NCOV).\nTo monitor how coronaviruses spread and evolve in animals, new generation sequencing (NGS) has been used. However, this sequencing can be quite expensive and many genetic virus markers may be lost.\nA team led by Lin-Fa Wang (from the Medical School of the University of Duke and the National University of Singapore) decided to make NGs cheaper and effective. To this end, it has improved one of the NGS strategies with molecular probes - radioactive DNA or RNA sequences used to detect the presence of a complementary sequence in a sample.\nIn experiments, it was able to identify coronaviruses, increase the sensitivity of the process and decrease its cost, it is indicated in a statement about the work. \"It does not mean that this improvement is a panacea for all the challenges of NGS, but in this case it is a step in the right direction,\" says Lin-Fa Wang.\nSubscribe newsletters for free and receive the best of the publicity and the deepest jobs of the public.\nThe investigator adds that this approach will be important to monitor coronaviruses in bats. \"The coronaviruses, especially those who originate in bats, are an important source of emerging infectious diseases,\" says Lin-Fa Wang, who has Batman nickname. For example, coronavirus that caused the outbreak of SARS in 2003 is very close genetically than lies in bats.\nAlthough the origin of the new coronavirus whose epidemic began in Wuhan, the bats are one of the probable sources. These animals can still be a nipah ebola or virus reservoir. In a scientific article published in 2018 in the magazine Cell Host and Microbe, it is suggested that bats will be able to host many viruses due to the evolutionary adaptations they had to do to fly, which ended up changing their immune system.\nAnd how can the new approach contribute to fighting an epidemic? When there are no outbreaks, scientists can go updating coronavirus-related genetic probes banks. During outbreaks, this information can be used to monitor the evolution of the virus and its transmission in animals and people.

", "label": 1}, {"content": "new coronavirus vaccine may be faster to develop. by sakina mohamedkuala lumpur\u00a0(bernama) -- with the number of cases and deaths already surpassing that of sars, teams around the world are racing to come up with a vaccine against the novel coronavirus (2019-ncov).at the time of writing, the virus has infected 43,104 people and killed 1,018 others.developing a vaccine safe\u00a0for human use typically takes years, but there is reason to believe that the process will be speedier this time around, said academician and virologist emeritus prof datuk dr lam sai kit.\u201cadvances in technology now makes it possible to come up with candidate vaccines in a matter of weeks, unlike traditional methods which can take years,\u201d he told bernama when contacted.in addition to that, scientists in china sequenced the virus\u2019s genome and made it available on jan 10, just a month after the dec 8 report of the first case of pneumonia from an unknown virus in wuhan.in contrast, scientists took more than half a year to sequence the coronavirus after the sars outbreak began in late 2002. \u00a0\u00a0how long will it take?lam noted that although candidate vaccines may be available in a matter of weeks, it would take much longer for them to be evaluated for human use.\u201cthese candidate vaccines have to be tested in animal studies before human clinical trials can be started. it is still a long road ahead, and by the time a vaccine is ready, the outbreak may already be over \u2013 like in the case of sars, where it took 20 months before a candidate vaccine was developed,\u201d said lam.the vaccine never made it to the market because the virus was successfully contained with public health measures. the vaccine against mers, meanwhile, is still being developed.immunologist datuk dr musa nordin said despite the pressure to come up with a vaccine as soon as possible, it must be noted that vaccine development remains an expensive and risky process.\u201con average, it takes 10 years from pre-clinical trials through phase 1-3 clinical trials before it is proven efficacious and safe for registration by regulatory bodies and use in man.\u201chowever, the new coronavirus has the benefit of experience with previous candidate vaccines for mers and sars, allowing a jump start on the development of vaccines. if i had to hazard a best optimistic guess, i would say (a vaccine would be developed) within six months,\u201d he said to bernama.\u00a0what if it mutates?one of the fears is that the 2019-ncov would mutate after a vaccine is finally developed, affecting its efficacy.however, it should be noted that coronavirus do not undergo the same type of genome shuffling as the influenza virus, which is constantly mutating.like sars, the genome of the novel coronavirus comprises a single strand of rna (ribonucleic acid). microbes with such genome are known to mutate very quickly, but sars has a molecular proofreading system that reduces its mutation rate.given the similarity to sars at the genomic level, it has been suggested that the 2019-ncov \nwould not be as prone to mutation as the flu virus, which comprise multiple single-stranded rna segments.therefore, if a vaccine is produced, it would still be effective.lam said that mutation is always a possibility with rna viruses like the coronavirus.\u201cusually, a major change happens when the virus jumps species. hopefully, if there is a mutation, it will be a minor and not involving the spike protein, which is\u00a0the important antigen used to produce the neutralising antibody in our immune system.\u201cwith minor changes, the vaccine will still offer protection, or modify the severity of the disease,\u201d he said.\u00a0cepithe coalition of endemic preparedness innovations (cepi) in january announced that it would be funding three programmes to develop vaccines against the 2019-ncov.it has engaged, among others, the queensland university to work on a vaccine using its recently developed rapid response technology.the university\u2019s head of school of chemistry and molecular biosciences prof paul young said that they would be using the novel technology, known as the molecular clamp, for the rapid generation of the vaccine.young\u2019s team of researchers have already experienced using this novel technology to produce candidate vaccines against influenza, nipah, ebola, and mers. the team is optimistic that it will be able to develop the coronavirus vaccine within six months.\u201cwe are working around the clock to produce enough of the spike proteins in cells to produce this sub-unit vaccine,\u201d said young in an email.a sub-unit vaccine is a fragment of a pathogen, typically a surface protein that is used to trigger an immune response. this is turn will stimulate acquired immunity against the pathogen from which it is derived.cepi is a nonprofit organisation formed in 2017 to fund vaccine development for emerging infectious diseases. it is based in oslo, norway and is a global partnership created to spearhead development of vaccines in this type of emergency.cepi is also funding inovio pharmaceuticals inc to develop the coronavirus vaccine.\u00a0\u201cbased on our experience of using new technologies to produce mers and lassa fever vaccines, inovio was able to design and construct a potential vaccine in a matter of hours following the release of the new coronavirus genetic code by china. we are targeting the first human tests to begin in the us before early summer,\u201d joseph kim, the president and ceo of inovio pharmaceuticals was quoted as saying.another cepi-funded vaccine project is with moderna therapeutics inc, which is working with the us national institute of allergy and infectious diseases. moderna is working on a vaccine based on rna molecules that instruct cells to make proteins to prevent or fight diseases.\u00a0good hygiene habits still best betlam said there was no guarantee that any antiviral drugs or vaccines would become available by the end of the current outbreak despite all the research being done. however, there was still reason to be optimistic.\u201calthough antiviral drugs and \neffective vaccines are still some months away, it must be remembered that we can still stop the virus in its track. as shown with sars and mers, public health approaches must remain a priority in containing the spread of the disease and treating those who have become infected.\u201ccontact tracing, isolating infected patients, wearing of face masks, frequent washing of hands, avoiding close contact with infected people are well tried and proven public health methods to control outbreaks. now that news is coming out of china that the virus can be spread by aerosol in addition to droplets, it will be a bit more challenging to avoid infection. a vaccine will be most welcome.\u201d\u00a0-- bernama ", "label": 1}, {"content": "The under the radar. How is the curve? Will #FlattTheCurve work - it will succeed in slowing the spread of the Coronavirus SARS-COV-2 in Germany and the world, now because people remain at home, impose governments starting locks and reduce social contacts to a minimum? For the right, this is difficult, even because there is a very high number of unpressed infection cases. How high she is, nobody knows exactly. At the same time, this dark figure is crucial for how the pandemic will run in the coming days and weeks. Researchers around Ruiyun Li from Imperial College in London also from an analysis of the outbreak situation in China, which they have published in the Science Science (Li et al., 2020). With the help of figures from 375 cities in China, the International Research Group modeled in retrospect, as the virus spreads in the period between the 10th and 23 January 2020, so at the beginning of the outbreak. According to the model, more than 80 percent of all infection cases could be unrecognized. Although an unrecognized diseased person, according to the data on average, was only half as contagious as a person whose infection was documented could have been responsible for 86 percent of all illnesses across China for 86 percent of all diseases. Many of those who have infected with the SARS COV 2 virus get mild or no symptoms. So you realize nothing of the infection and do not fall as ill. These people also tend to continue to participate in social life. Thus, these unnoticed infected people can expose much more healthy people to the virus as persons who are recognizable sick and therefore more likely to be identified as such or treated anyway in a hospital. And the experts and experts calculated with the same method, which caused the restrictions of social contacts in China. They examined how the virus spread after the Chinese government had taken restricting measures. Above all, this is one of the fact that the authorities travel from and to Wuhan restricted or completely banned, domestic quarantine ordered or at least excited and the capacities for fast test procedures expanded. These restrictions would have helped that the virus could not spread as soon as quickly as early. Among other things, the rate of infection was reduced from unrecognized sufferers. The reason for this could be that the authorities could better understand infection chains or people who had identified but were not documented as such, through the general starting locks less contact with other people. At the end of 2019, China's World Health Organization WHO reported a pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause from Wuhan. one \nWeek later, researchers identified a novel virus as the cause: they called it 2019-NCOV. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. Meanwhile, it is known as SARS COV-2 (COV stands for coronavirus, SARS for a respiratory disease triggered by a similar pathogen). SARS-COV-2 could have spread from a food market in Wuhan. There, exotic animals like reptiles were also sold. The lung disease that can trigger the new virus is now referred to as COVID-19 (English for coronavirus disease; Coronavirus disease). The disease is a so-called zoonose - a plague through a pathogen from the animal kingdom. Parts of virus bodies of SARS COV-2 same pathogens affecting bats. The new virus could have been transferred to humans via a still unknown intermediary. Both the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as well as Mers (MIDDLE East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses which have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more than 750 died. With the Mers virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. In total there are several hundred types of coronaviren. Many of them affect the respiratory tract and can cause colds. Medizors and physicians assume that the virus is transmitted above all about droplet infection from person to person. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals. More than 200,000 cases of Corona worldwide (as of March 18th) were now registered. Added to this is a high number of dark figure, the researchers roughly suspect somewhere between 50 and 80 percent of all cases. Several thousand people have demonstrably died worldwide. In most, the infection is very mild. Among the deaths are mainly people with severe pre-existence and older people. The course of the registered cases in Germany can be tracked here on this map. The number of infected worldwide, which have been positively tested on Corona, shows this map of Johns-Hopkins University. That can not be said yet. The WHO announced on January 28, that about one-fifth of the persons filed as an infected persons through the virus will be severely ill, so in case of doubt should be treated intensive care. Meanwhile, the WHO classifies the disease as a pandemic. Diverse states have imposed entry and outgoing restrictions to slow the spread. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. States around the world have now reported infection cases, including Germany. research \nare currently working on therapies and vaccination. The first clinical trials with vaccines have begun, that is, a few patients are tested by testing. In order to get the virus under control named SARS-COV-2, more infection cases would have to be identified and more potential sufferers are isolated, writing the authors in the report. However, it could not be clearly telling whether these measures were sufficient for the virus to disappear in the long term and does not recover when loosening the restrictions. Whether these findings can be obtained on Germany, also remains unclear. The number of undiscovered infected and the general contagion risk varies depending on which measures the respective country interspersed with which test capacities are available and how well the health system is prepared for the outbreak. The President of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) said at a press conference on March 17, that one deals from being able to identify about 50 percent of all infected in Germany. The other half of those who have infected or infected are probably no or only slight symptoms and is therefore rarely recognized. Follow the current pandemic development here in Liveblog.

covid-19 infections than any other country, and a record number of newly unemployed people, as the coronavirus crisis deepens around the world.   hours after his nation\u00a0reached the grim milestone, us president donald trump spoke by phone to china's xi jinping, after weeks of bickering and finger pointing over a disease researchers say could kill at least 1.8 million people by the end of the year.   \"just finished a very good conversation with president xi of china,\" mr trump tweeted.   \"china has been through much & has developed a strong understanding of the virus. we are working closely together. much respect!\"   the warm words\u00a0\u2014 which were not quite echoed in the chinese state media readout of the call\u00a0\u2014 came after a few weeks in which the white house had repeatedly referred to \"the chinese coronavirus\", angering beijing.   china, which appears to have got on top of its own outbreak, readied to bar entry to foreigners as it frets over a surge in imported cases, illustrating the difficulty of containing a virus in an interconnected world.   wuhan, the city where the illness first emerged late last year, was\u00a0\u2014 from midnight\u00a0\u2014 to ease severe movement restrictions in place for two months.   that initial lockdown has now been aped around the world, with three billion people told to stay indoors.   healthcare systems in even the most developed nations are being stretched to breaking point with dire warnings they could soon be overwhelmed.   more than 530,000 people globally have been sickened by the disease.   a tally by johns hopkins university showed that by around 5pm sgt friday (march 27), there were almost 86,000 known infections in the us. that figure is higher than both china and hard-hit italy, which accounts for a third of the 24,000 deaths worldwide.   grim predictions   even with lockdowns implemented around the world, researchers at imperial college london said thursday the global death toll could be staggering.   their model shows 1.86 million people could die, with nearly 470 million infected this year.\u00a0   failure to act swiftly in imposing lockdowns and strict social distancing could make those numbers far higher, they warned.   \"our analysis highlights the challenging decisions faced by all governments in the coming weeks and months, but demonstrates the extent to which rapid, decisive and collective action now could save millions of lives,\" the researchers said.   as fears mount over a global recession that could even dwarf the great depression of the 1930s, leaders from the group of 20 major economies\u00a0held crisis talks by video link on thursday.   they pledged a \"united front\" to fight the outbreak\u00a0\u2014 along with an enormous financial rescue package.   \"the virus respects no borders,\" the leaders said in a statement.   \"we are injecting over us$5 trillion (s$7.17 trillion) into the global economy, as part of targeted fiscal \npolicy, economic measures, and guarantee schemes to counteract the social, economic and financial impacts of the pandemic.\"   they also pledged \"robust\" support for developing nations, where experts fear the coronavirus could wreak havoc.   painful choices   medical systems in even the most developed nations are straining under the weight of new patients.   in new york, where tens of thousands are ill, governor andrew cuomo warned there were simply not enough hospital beds.   \"almost any scenario that is realistic will overwhelm the capacity of the current healthcare system,\" he said.   for those fighting on the frontlines, the pressure was showing.   \"to watch somebody in their thirties die, it's hard,\" said one respiratory therapist in the city who requested anonymity. \"you can't have visitors. they're in the room by themselves on a ventilator. it's very depressing.\"   in europe, medics were already having to make choices.   \"if i've got five patients and only one bed, i have to choose who gets it,\" dr sara chinchilla, a pediatrician at a hospital near madrid, told afp.   \"people are dying who could be saved but there's no space in intensive care.\"   economic devastation   the pandemic has already become catastrophic for the global economy.   in the united states, the world's largest economy, the labor department reported that 3.3 million people applied for unemployment benefits last week\u00a0\u2014 by far the highest number ever recorded.   job losses have swept across sectors from food services to retail to transportation, as nearly half of the country has closed non-essential businesses.   \"it is staggering. we are only seeing the initial numbers; they will get worse, unfortunately,\" new york mayor bill de blasio told reporters, estimating that half a million people in the city would lose work.   stock markets remained volatile, with asian bourses in the green friday after a third straight day of rises on wall street, while europe started the day down.   traders have taken heart from the passage through the senate of a $2 trillion stimulus bill\u00a0\u2014 the largest in us history, which will support american businesses and provide cash payouts averaging us$3,400 for a family of four.   the bill goes before the\u00a0house of representatives on friday. afp ", "label": 1}, {"content": "novel coronavirus named 'covid-19': who. geneva (afp) - the un health agency on tuesday (feb 11) announced that \"covid-19\" will be the official name of the deadly virus from china, saying the

outbreak was first identified on dec 31. \n tedros said the name had been chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location, animal species or group of people in line with international recommendations for naming aimed at preventing stigmatisation. \n who had earlier given the virus the temporary name of \"2019-ncov acute respiratory disease\" and china's national health commission

those diseases were first identified and which are now inevitably linked to them in the public mind. \n more general names such as \"middle east respiratory syndrome\" or \"spanish flu\" are also now avoided as they can stigmatise entire regions or ethnic groups. \n who also notes that using animal species in the name can create confusion, such as in 2009 when h1n1 was popularly referred to as \"swine flu\". \n this had a major impact on the pork industry even though the disease was being spread by people rather than pigs. \n people's names - usually the scientists who identified the disease - are also banned, as are \"terms that incite undue fear\" such as \"unknown\" or \"fatal\", the who said. \n the virus has killed more than 1,000 people, infected over 42,000 and reached some 25 countries, with the who declaring a global health emergency. \n addressing scientists at the first international conference on combating the virus earlier on tuesday, tedros warned that the virus was a \"very grave threat\". \n \"viruses can have more powerful consequences than any terrorist action,\" he told reporters later. \n about 400 scientists were taking part in the two-day international meeting in geneva called to review how the virus is transmitted and possible vaccines against it. \n \"we are not defenceless,\" tedros said, adding: \"if we invest now... we have a realistic chance of stopping this outbreak.\" \n participants will also discuss the source of the virus, which is thought to have originated in bats and reached humans via other \"intermediary\" species such as snakes or pangolins. \n who sent an advance team to china this week for an international mission to examine the epidemic. \n it was unclear, however, whether the team would be able to visit wuhan, a city in central china which has been under lockdown after the outbreak was registered in a food and live animal market in the city. \n no specific treatment or vaccine against the virus exists, and who has repeatedly urged countries to share data in order to further research into the disease. \n \"that is especially true in relation to sharing of samples and sequences. to defeat this outbreak, we need open and equitable sharing, according to the principles of fairness and equity,\" tedros told the scientific conference. \n he said he hoped the scientists could agree a roadmap \"around which researchers and donors will align\". \n several teams of experts in australia, britain, china, france, germany and the united states are racing to develop a vaccine - a process that normally takes years. \n efforts to come up with a vaccine are being led by the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations (cepi), a body established in 2017 to finance costly biotechnology research in the wake of an ebola outbreak in west africa that killed more than 11,000 people. \n ultimately, however, scientists may end up in the same situation they were during the 2002-03 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) - which died out before a vaccine could be fully developed. \n a close cousin of covid-19, sars spread around the world and killed nearly 800.

The World Health Organization Briefing (WHO) of this Wednesday brought a significant change: Cuvid-19, caused by the new Coronavirus, was officially declared a \"pandemic\". Almost three months after starting in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the virus that however spoiled the rest of the world is no longer treated as \"epidemic.\"\nOn Twitter, and in the voice of Tedro Ghreyesus, Director General, WHO warns that \"pandemic is not a word to use in a light or careful way.\" \"It is a word that, misused, can cause irrational fear or unjustified acceptance that the fight is over, leading to unnecessary suffering and death.\"\nAccording to the definition of WHO itself, an epidemic is an outbreak of a disease that spreads at local, regional or national level, unexpectedly. C.D.C, North American Organization of Disease Control and Prevention Centers, says it happens when it occurs \"an increase, often sudden increase in the number of cases of an illness above what is usually expected\" for this area.\nBy opposition, WHO defined the pandemic as \"the worldwide dissemination of a new disease\" affecting a high number of people. According to the last count, Covid-19 has already been diagnosed in more than 122 thousand people from 121 countries - more than 66 thousand healed.\nBeing declared a pandemic is not really a surprise. \"The threat of a pandemic is getting more and more real,\" said the same Ghreyesus last week. The time gap between the dissemination of Covid-19 and the WHO statement has been explained as an attempt to lock the panic, on the one hand, and for another because it has already believed that the outbreak could be contained and delimited to certain countries.\nFrom now on, it stops making sense to think of containing Covid-19. It is a \"pandemic\", that is, a \"internationally disseminated new disease\". Therefore, countries stop trying to lock new infected entry and have to worry about how the disease is transmitted among their citizens.\nWhen there is an epidemic in a country, others can close and send aid to the country, or countries, affected. Shipping of masks and protection material to Wuhan at the beginning of the outbreak is an example of the measures that take place in such cases.\nBut when it comes to a pandemic, all countries are considered infected and therefore each should look into their borders and try to work the healing or resolution of the disease - more than prevention. International organizations such as WHO or UN nations are required to divide resources around the world, which means new difficulties, need for more people, more money, more supply capacity to combat the disease.\n\"We had never seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus,\" warns the WHO, which claims to be fully focused on the fight since the first patient was diagnosed. \"81 countries did not report any case of Covid-19 and 57 countries reported 10 cases or less. We can not say this high enough or clear enough or enough frequency: all countries can still change the course of this pandemic. \"\nCurrently, around the world there is registration of 121,564 confirmed cases of infection; There are 4,373 confirmed deaths (3,046 in China) and 66,239 people already recovered.\nPortugal should enter within the next few hours in the so-called mitigation phase, which is characterized by local transmission in closed environment and Community transmission.
