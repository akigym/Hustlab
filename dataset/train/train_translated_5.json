again after being discharged from hospital, doctors in wuhan have found. \n researchers around the world are trying to determine whether recovered patients can still infect people with the coronavirus that causes the disease and if they have developed antibodies offering them immunity to the disease. \n doctors from tongji hospital in the city, where the disease was first identified, told state broadcaster cctv that they have found no evidence that the recovered patients became infectious after recovery, based on close observations of their family members and laboratory tests. \n in spite of its relatively small sample size, the tongji hospital research is especially relevant as china now has far more recovered patients than new confirmed cases. \n the chinese mainland, where the disease first emerged last december, has discharged over 90 per cent of its infected patients and around 4,300 confirmed patients are still receiving treatment in hospitals. \n the country has reported more than 81,000 cases in total and over 3,100 deaths, but most of the new cases have been imported. \n dr wang wei, president of tongji hospital told cctv's prime-time programme that of the 147 recovered patients they studied, only five\u00a0\u2014 or just over 3 per cent\u00a0\u2014 have tested positive in nucleic acid tests again after recovery. \n meanwhile, life times, a health news outlet affiliated with people's daily, reported this week that quarantine facilities in wuhan have reported that about 5 to 10 per cent of their recovered patients tested positive again. \n previous reports have also highlighted cases where patients tested positive after recovery, including one on sunday from life times about a family of three in wuhan, who all tested positive again. \n these incidents have raised questions about whether nucleic acid tests might not be reliable in detecting traces of the virus in some of the recovered patients. \n some experts have also expressed concerns about the sensitivity and stability of the test kits, and the collection and handling of patients' samples. \n dr wang told cctv that the five patients from his hospital who tested positive again did not have any symptoms, and none of their family members or people in close contact with them has been infected. \n he said there was no conclusive evidence to prove that the recovered patients who tested positive again would be infectious to others. \n \"so far there is no evidence to suggest that they are infectious,\" dr wang said, adding that surveillance of similar patients showed about 80 to 90 per cent of them had no trace of the coronavirus in their blood one month after being discharged from hospitals. \n another sample group of 15 patients from the hospital also confirmed a similar trend, with none infecting their family members. \n \"these are just small samples and not enough to assure us of the validity of our initial findings,\" dr wang said. \"we need a large-scale epidemiological study to guide our disease surveillance and prevention works.\" \n however, he said it was imperative for recovered patients to stay in isolation for two weeks after discharge so they could be tested again for confirmation. \n in a separate interview with cctv also broadcast on tuesday, dr tong chaohui, a respiratory disease expert from a central government task force in hubei, where wuhan is located, agreed that continued monitoring of the recovered patients was important. \n \"so far, none of the close family members of these recovered patients have been tested positive and we could not find the coronavirus in the laboratory cultured samples [from these patients ],\" dr tong said. \n \"although the nucleic acid tests were positive, random checking suggested that the patients have developed antibodies that were effective in protecting them from the nucleic acid of the virus,\" he added. \n speaking to official newspaper hubei daily early this week, mr tu yuanchao, deputy director of hubei health commission, said discharged patients who tested positive again and have shown symptoms would be re-hospitalised. those who do not have symptoms would be sent to quarantine facilities for observation for two weeks. south china morning post ", "label": 1}, {"content": "italian scientists investigate possible earlier emergence of coronavirus. milan - italian researchers are looking at whether a higher than usual number of cases of severe pneumonia and flu in lombardy in the last quarter of 2019 may be a signal that the new coronavirus might have spread beyond china earlier than previously thought.  \n adriano decarli, an epidemiologist and medical statistics professor at the university of milan, said there had been a \"significant\" increase in the number of people hospitalised for pneumonia and flu in the areas of milan and lodi between october and december last year.  \n he told reuters he could not give exact figures but \"hundreds\" more people than usual had been taken to hospital in the last three months of 2019 in those areas - two of lombardy's worst hit cities - with pneumonia and flu-like symptoms, and some of those had died.  \n decarli is reviewing the hospital records and other clinical details of those cases, including people who later died at home, to try to understand whether the new coronavirus epidemic had already spread to italy back then.  \n \"we want to know if the virus was already here in italy at the end of 2019, and - if yes - why it remained undetected for a relatively long period so that we could have a clearer picture in case we have to face a second wave of the epidemic,\" he said.  \n the world health organization has said the new coronavirus and covid-19, the respiratory disease it causes, were unknown before the outbreak was first reported in wuhan, in central china, in december.  \n decarli said once his research was concluded, local health authorities might decide to request authorisation to exhume bodies of people with suspect symptoms.  \n other experts cast doubt on the hypothesis that the new virus could have been circulating in europe before the end of 2019.  \n \"i think it extremely unlikely that the virus was present in europe before january,\" said paul hunter, a professor in medicine at britain's university of east anglia who has been tracking the evolving pandemic.  \n hunter said that unless italian scientists get positive results from samples taken and stored at that time, then the suggestion should not be given credence.  \n he added that, given what we know about how infectious the virus is, and the ratio of patients showing no symptoms compared with those that get sick, \"it is inconceivable that we would not have had a pretty major epidemic in europe much earlier if these cases had in fact been covid-19\".  \n  \n highest death toll  \n italy, which now has the highest number of covid-19 deaths in the world, recorded its first case of infection on feb. 21, though some scientists think the virus began circulating in the country at least a month earlier.  \n \"the virus was already here in the second half of january,\" said massimo galli, head of the infectious disease unit at milan's sacco hospital and a professor at the department of biomedical and clinical sciences at the university of milan.  \n he said, however, that the probability of the virus circulating in italy before january was \"very low\".  \n giuseppe remuzzi, director of the mario negri institute for pharmacological research, in milan, said some family doctors in lombardy had reported unusual cases of pneumonia late last year that now looked potentially suspicious.  \n he said among those were several cases of bilateral pneumonia - which means both lungs are affected - in the areas of gera d'adda and crema in late november and december, with high fever, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.  \n \"none of these cases have been documented as covid-19 because there was no evidence yet of the existence of covid-19,\" he said.  \n remuzzi said that if evidence of covid-19 cases in italy as far back as november was confirmed, this may signal that the virus can go undetected for months.  \n he said some reports in scientific journals had also led other scientists to question whether the virus may have emerged in china as early as october. reuters ", "label":

At the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities of the World Health Organization WHO reported an accumulation of pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause in the Central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the diseases. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days then a group released a group of the virologen Christian's premier from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 the first diagnostic test for the new virus, the researcher provisionally call 2019-NCOV. With the test, the virus can be detected in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, on which, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as well as Mers (MIDDLE East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses which have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more than 750 died. With the MERS virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronaviruses. Many of them relate to respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example.\nIn China, several thousand persons are suffering from them, some of them - most of them with pre-existing conditions - have died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first infection cases outside of China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been in Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection with a tourist, who came back from Wuhan, on January 24, the first cases were known in France. Meanwhile, first cases were confirmed in Germany. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. The virus can cause pneumonia that can endally end. Since it is a viral illness, antibiotics do not help.\nMeanwhile, it is clear that the virus can be transferred from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transfers after a dozen cases were known in medical staff. Medizors assume that the virus is transmitted above all over droplet infection. The World Health Organization calculates, as announced on January 24, at the moment that an infected one cuts 1.4 to 2.5 other people. Contest these numbers, the virus is less contagious than SARS and also the viral flu. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThat can not be said yet. The World Health Organization said on 28 January that about one-fifth of the reported cases through the virus will be seriously ill, so in case of doubt must be treated intensive care. According to reports, the first death pots were patients who had some severe pre-existing conditions. Even with other infectious diseases, people with pre-existing diseases are particularly endangered - for example at the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so change their genome.

misleading or incomplete information to the public. us state and local officials also have complained of being kept in the dark about essential federal response information.   us\u00a0vice-president mike pence, the administration's point person on coronavirus, vowed on march 3 to offer \u201creal-time information in a steady pace and be fully transparent.\u201d the vice president, appointed by us president donald trump in late february, is holding regular news briefings and also has pledged to rely on expert guidance.   ms katie miller, pence's press secretary, said on wednesday (march 11) that since being appointed, the vice president has never requested that hhs hold meetings in the scif or treat information as classified.   the meetings at hhs were held in a secure area called a \"sensitive compartmentalised information facility,\" or scif, according to the administration officials.   scifs are usually reserved for intelligence and military operations. ordinary cell phones and computers can't be brought into the chambers. hhs has scifs because theoretically it would play a major role in biowarfare or chemical attacks.   a high-level former official who helped address public health outbreaks in the george w\u00a0bush administration said \u201cit\u2019s not normal to classify discussions about a response to a public health crisis.\u201d   attendees at the meetings included hhs secretary alex azar and his chief of staff brian harrison, the officials said. mr azar and mr harrison resisted the classification of the meetings, the sources said.   hhs did not make mr azar or mr harrison available for comment.   one of the administration officials told reuters that when complex issues about a quarantine came up, a high-ranking hhs lawyer with expertise on the issue was not admitted because he did not have the proper security clearance. his input was delayed and offered at an unclassified meeting, the official said.   a fifth source familiar with the meetings said hhs staffers often weren\u2019t informed about coronavirus developments because they didn\u2019t have adequate clearance. he said he was told that the matters were classified \"because it had to do with china\".   the coronavirus epidemic originated in china and the administration\u2019s main focus to prevent spread early on was to restrict travel by non-us\u00a0citizens coming from china and to authorize the quarantine of people entering the united states who may have been exposed to the virus.   one of the administration officials suggested the security clearances for meetings at hhs were imposed not to protect national security but to keep the information within a tight circle, to prevent leaks.   \u201cit seemed to be a tool for the white house \u2014\u00a0for the nsc \u2014\u00a0to keep participation in these meetings low,\u201d the official said.   two democratic senators, both senior members of the intelligence committee expressed dismay wednesday in statements to reuters.   \u201cpandemics demand transparency and competence,\" said mr mark warner \nof virginia. \"classification authority should never be abused in order to hide what the government is doing, or not doing, just to satisfy domestic political concerns.\u201d   mr ron wyden of oregon said: \"the executive branch needs to immediately come forward and explain whether the white house hid information from the american people as a result of bogus classification.\" reuters ", "label": 1}, {"content": "why many covid-19 deaths will never appear in china's official figures. hong kong \u2014 retired wuhan factory worker wei junlan had always been in good health, but around two weeks after developing the first signs of a cough and fever, the 63-year-old was dead from what doctors suspect was the new coronavirus, covid-19.   but her death on jan 21 will not show up in official statistics about the outbreak\u00a0\u2014 her death certificate listed the cause only as \u201cheavy pneumonia\u201d.   her nephew jerry shang said that wei had not been tested for the disease, but that the doctor said her symptoms\u00a0\u2014 including a lung infection, fever and increasing weakness\u00a0\u2014 closely matched those of covid-19, the disease caused by the virus.   by the end she was unable to walk, and the last the family saw of her was when she was being wheeled into the emergency room. the doctor told the family: \u201cit\u2019s the pneumonia that everybody around the country knows about.\u201d   local doctors have heard of many such cases and many wuhan residents have complained that family members cannot get a proper diagnosis because frontline hospitals are overwhelmed in the face of high patient numbers and a shortage of supplies and testing kits.   dr wei peng, a community hospital doctor in the city, said that medical staff were not allowed to list coronavirus as a cause of death when cases had not been confirmed and said that later instructions had even banned them from listing pneumonia. instead they can only write the immediate cause of a patient\u2019s death, such as diabetes or organ failure.   he also said the problem was compounded by the difficulty in getting some patients to hospital in time.   he gave the example of a woman whose father died at home because she did not have the strength to get him to her car and the ambulance was too busy to collect him.   \u201csuch patients die at home, nothing can be done, and they cannot be counted in the official numbers,\u201d he said.   some patients, like wei, have died without it ever being confirmed what had taken their lives.   china\u2019s health authorities have admitted that the real number of covid-19 cases is likely to be higher than official statistics show.   \u201cthe mortality rate that we calculate at the moment is for confirmed cases; there are cases with lighter symptoms or other scenarios not included in our statistics,\u201d ms jiao yahui, an official with the national health commission, said at a news conference last week.   wei had never been to the huanan seafood market, where the virus is widely believed to have originated, but she lived just 3km (2 miles) away and shang, her nephew, suspects she became infected in the neighbourhood.   he also questioned the accuracy of the official figures for covid-19 deaths and infections.   \u201cas they updated the list of deaths, i kept checking for her name, but she was never among them,\u201d he said. \u201cafter a while, they stopped publishing individual names.\u201d   since official channels are overloaded, grass-roots volunteers across the \ncountry have come together to help verify and update medical information online, as well as assist people in need to contact those who can help them.   one such volunteer, beijing-based li nian, said cases such as wei\u2019s were common and often whole families could become infected.   but while the volunteers are able to provide communities with useful information\u00a0\u2014 for example, telling people which hospitals have available beds or testing kits\u00a0\u2014 getting full information about the situation on the ground is almost impossible.   one woman ms li has been trying to help lost her husband at the start of the month\u00a0\u2014 by which time the rest of the family had also fallen ill.   although the woman and her son are now recovering, she is still frantically searching for a hospital with spare beds for her mother-in-law, whose illness is yet to be diagnosed.   others have adopted more desperate measures in an effort to gain admission to hospital. over the weekend one video widely circulated on social media showed a woman standing on her balcony banging a gong while shouting: \u201chelp! i\u2019m dying! help, please someone help! i am at the end of my wits!\u201d   hubei daily later reported that the woman had been trying to get help for her mother, who has since been confirmed as suffering from corvid-19 and is being treated in hanyang hospital.   the grief of those whose relatives have died at home is compounded by their confusion about what to do next, and often they do not have time for proper goodbyes.   ms li said the woman she was helping barely had time to deal with her husband\u2019s death. the funeral home sent a car to pick up the body, but she did not know what to do with his bedsheets and clothes and was also trying to concentrate on finding a hospital bed for her mother-in-law.   another wuhan resident, ms xia chengfang, was unable to say a proper farewell to her grandfather, who died on january 28.   \u201cthe hospital directly called the funeral home to cremate his body, we weren\u2019t able to see him in the end. my mother and uncle picked up his clothing, drove far away from the crowds and burned it,\u201d she said.   funeral homes in the city have been working nonstop during the outbreak. an employee from wuchang funeral home named huang told tencent news recently that staff were working round-the-clock shifts and often only have a few minutes rest between jobs.v   families of the dead are also banned from holding funeral ceremonies to prevent the further spread of the disease. instead the hospitals, or families of those who die at home, have to contact the funeral homes who then take care of matters.   when the deceased is a suspected covid-19 case, the family is asked to sanitise the home before the body is collected.   \u201cwe wear a full protection suit, with gloves, masks and goggles,\u201d huang said. \u201cwhen we come back to the funeral home, we spray disinfectant all over our bodies and hang the suit out to dry.\u201d   after his aunt died, mr jerry shang said the family was not allowed to \nsee her body or arrange the funeral.   instead, the hospital collected patients\u2019 bodies and arranged for a local funeral home to cremate them together.   mr shang is the only member of wei\u2019s family remaining in wuhan after he told the dead woman\u2019s son to join her husband and other children in the southern city of shenzhen before wuhan went into lockdown.   he said that wei\u2019s ashes were now being held at a local funeral home, adding: \u201cthe hospital said my cousin could come back and collect them once the outbreak is over.\u201d south china morning post ", "label": 0}, {"content": "Easyjet

now we amend that to 'really bad or much worse.' we now expect covid-19 to cause a global recession in 2020, of similar magnitude to the recessions of 1982 and 2009.\"    the global economy was forecast to expand 1.6% this year, about half the 3.1% predicted in the january poll, and the weakest since the global financial crisis of 2007-09. forecasts for 2020 global gdp ranged from -2.0% to +2.7%.    \"as cases of\u00a0coronavirus spiral upward, disruptions to the global economy are increasing. we have cut our global gdp growth forecast to 1.25% for the year - less severe than the deep recessions of 1981-82 and 2008-09, but worse than the mild recessions of 1991 and 2001,\" noted goldman sachs' economics research team.    \"consistent with this, our economists now expect recessions in europe, japan, canada and possibly the united states.\"    the u.s. \neconomy was almost certain to enter a recession this year, if it is not in one already, according to a poll published on thursday and taken after the federal reserve's emergency move on sunday.    \"the u.s. economy is going to have a shock from this coronavirus and i think that there's still a lot of uncertainty around the size and the depth and the prolonged period of the shock,\" said tiffany wilding, north american economist at pacific investment management co (pimco).    \"we're still getting our heads wrapped around that. we think it's quite likely that the u.s. has a small technical recession this year.\"    as for the world's second largest economy, china, where the virus outbreak originated, a reuters poll published on march 6 showed the outlook was once again cut significantly for this quarter, next quarter, and for 2020.    since then, economists have been slashing their forecasts even more.    the economic damage from the outbreak was predicted to reverberate through other major economies in asia too, with most forecast to slow significantly, halt or shrink outright in the current quarter according to a feb. 26 reuters poll.    japan's economy, which already contracted sharply toward the end of 2019, was expected to grow only 0.1% in the new fiscal year that begins in april, a march 6 reuters survey found, revised down from 0.5% projected in february.    following the rapid spread of virus infections from china to other countries, including europe, the risk of a euro zone recession doubled in a poll taken earlier this month.    it was not very different for the uk, where the bank of england cut rates to near-zero on thursday and re-started its asset purchases.    the british economy was expected to expand 0.1% this quarter and then contract 0.3% next quarter, a sharp revision from the 0.3% expansion they had expected before for both the quarters in the previous poll.    in a worst case scenario, the economy was forecast to contract 1.0% next quarter and by 0.7% in 2020. forecasts were as low as -5.0% and -3.0%, respectively, with no economist expecting growth in either period in the worst case. reuters ", "label": 1}, {"content": "Covid-19.

Only there were only individual cases, meanwhile the number of reported evidence rises from day to day: a novel virus grabs in China, even from more and more other countries, isolated infections are reported. Threaten the world a new pandemic? How many cases are there? The number of confirmed infections rose on Tuesday to around 300. Initially, only the Central Chinese 11 million metropolis of Wuhan was affected, in the meantime, cases in other places both in the north and in the south of China are now reported by the Chinese authorities. It is also confirmed that the virus can be transferred from person to person. Unclear is currently the possible dark figure of unparalleled infections. There are no information from China. Experts of Imperial College London assume that the new disease is already widespread substantially further than previously known. After their extrapolation, there could already be more than 1700 infected. \"Such estimates are always available with great uncertainties,\" said the Berlin virus researcher Christian's suffrid. \"But in the core, but I believe in these numbers.\" Has the virus already spread in other countries? Confirmed infections were reported until Tuesday from Taiwan, Thailand, Japan and South Korea. All those affected were previously in Wuhan, so very likely to be infected in China. In addition, there are suspected cases in several countries, for example in the Philippines. In Europe, no cases introduced by travelers were known. More and more countries worldwide are a precautionary special controls at airports for people traveling from China. How could the upcoming New Year festival affect the spread? The new coronavirus meets China in the middle of the annual main journey time. Not only that hundreds of millions of Chinese are traveling in the country these days to be punctually at the New Year Festival on Friday with their families. In the two-week holiday season around the festival company many families also joint travel abroad. In addition to destinations in Southeast Asia, traveling to Europe or the USA are also popular. Can the risk for the population in Germany be assessed? Currently, the risk of the relevant Robert Koch Institute (RKI, Stand 20.1.) In Berlin is classified as \"very low\". This assessment can change due to new findings at short notice. \"We have to prepare for us in Germany that at least in individual cases, it comes to introductions of the disease,\" said the virus researcher Christian's premier. \"Clinics must then be prepared to isolate the patients.\" A safe prediction can not be done at the moment, so outside. \"It can be on the one hand that we have to do it with a heavy and eye-catching clinical picture - then it's good to be curable because recognizable.\" But if it is a harmless disease in most cases \nGo, much like a cold, you will not be able to curb the infection wave so easily because infections hardly started. \"Then it is less dangerous.\" What is known about the symptoms of viral disease? According to current knowledge, the virus for fever and symptoms of pneumonia, explained the Berlin Virus Researcher Christian Drosten. \"The upper respiratory tract are hardly affected, there is, for example, no cold.\" From lung to lungs, a pathogen gets heavier than with the droplets in sneezing. A protective vaccine or a special therapy for the treatment of infection does not exist, only the symptoms can be mitigated with medicines. What is known about the deceased patients? Six deaths were known by Tuesday. The first victim was a 61-year-old, which, according to Chinese authorities, also suffered from cancer and chronic liver disease. The second victim was therefore a 69-year-old with a heart disease. There is no information on the third death victim. The fourth death victim is an 89-year-old who should have had diabetes and a heart disease. For the two last confirmed deaths, no details were present. To what extent is medical staff affected? By Tuesday, the Chinese authorities were confirmed 15 evidence of hospital employees in the Central Chinese city of Wuhan. For experts, it is an important indicator of whether physicians and caregivers are affected by a new illness: are many of them infecting, is a clear indication of a slight transferability. What is known about the virus? Currently, the virus is referred to by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a \"new coronavirus\" - 2019-NCOV. An expert group of virologists will carry out the final naming. Coronaviruses are known to skip new hosts very quickly and cause serious disease courses. Analyzes of the Erggut, according to the Berlin Virus Researcher Christian, have shown that it is a SARS virus variant. \"It's the same virus style, only in another variant,\" said the director of the Institute of Virology at the Charit\u00e9 in Berlin. Differences, especially in the proteins, with which the virus of human cells are stylish. SARS viruses are among the coronaviruses, which often cause harmless diseases such as colds. However, there are also pathogens of dangerous respiratory diseases such as Mers. A SARS virus had resulted in a worldwide pandemic with 8,000 infected from China, starting with 8,000 people, about 800 people. Meanwhile, it is probably just in animals. Fortunately, the virus was not so easily transferable as the seasonal flu, experts said later. SARS stands for \"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\", ie heavy acute respiratory syndrome. What about the \nOrigin of the pathogen known? The first infections are associated with a now closed fish market in Wuhan, where wildlife were sold. The SARS pathogens of 2002/2003 was most likely from a wildlife to humans over jumped, assumed source are cleeheads. The Chinese authorities have already had a hypothesis of which animal species of the new pathogens could have jumped across humans, so virus researchers Christian. \"But that is not officially announced when it is considered secured.\" How does the World Health Organization (WHO) react? The WHO has convened its emergency committee because of lung disease. The experts should advise on Wednesday. If the WHO exclaims an international health nightstand, she recommends sharply measures to combat the disease. Among other things, border controls and setting up specialized treatment centers can be included. Currently, the WHO does not recommend any travel or trading restrictions, but there are evidence of general hygiene and behavioral rules for travelers to Wuhan in China. How unusual is the emergence of a new pathogen? The fact that a previously unknown virus, as the current outbreaks in humans, is coming according to the assessment of the Berlin Virus Research Christian Drosten about every ten years. Rabies, HIV, Mers, Ebola: Most people's infectious diseases come from the animal kingdom. Just mammals wear pathogens that skip on humans. As a source of new coronaviruses, bats and flyers apply. Farm animals have also transferred coronaviruses in the past. In spontaneous host changes of a pathogen, the risk of dangerous epidemic is often greater than for a long circle because man has no antibodies against the new pathogen.

key u.s. public health agency operating inside china, as part of a larger rollback of u.s.-funded health and science experts on the ground there leading up to the coronavirus outbreak, reuters has learned. most of the reductions were made at the beijing office of the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) and occurred over the past two years, according to public cdc documents viewed by reuters and interviews with four people familiar with the drawdown. the atlanta-based cdc, america\u2019s preeminent disease fighting agency, provides public health assistance to nations around the world and works with them to help stop outbreaks of contagious diseases from spreading globally. it has worked in china for 30 years. the cdc\u2019s china headcount has shrunk to around 14 staffers, down from approximately 47 people since president donald trump took office in january 2017, the documents show. the four people, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the losses included epidemiologists and other health professionals. the material  reviewed by reuters shows a breakdown of how many american and local chinese employees were assigned there. the documents are the cdc\u2019s own descriptions of its headcount, which it posts online. reuters was able to search past copies of the material to confirm the decline described by the four people. \u201cthe cdc office in beijing is a shell of its former self,\u201d said one of the people, a u.s. official who worked in china at the time of the drawdown. separately, the national science foundation (nsf) and the united states agency for international development (usaid), the global relief program which had a role in helping china monitor and respond to outbreaks, also shut their beijing offices on trump\u2019s watch. before the closures, each office was staffed by a u.s. official. in addition, the u.s. department of agriculture(usda) transferred out of china in 2018 the manager of an animal disease monitoring program. reductions at the u.s. agencies sidelined health experts, scientists and other professionals who might have been able to help china mount an earlier response to the novel coronavirus, as well as provide the u.s. government with more information about what was coming, according to the people who spoke with reuters. the trump administration in february chastised china for censoring information about the outbreak and for keeping u.s. experts from entering the country to assist. \u201cwe had a large operation of experts in china who were brought back during this administration, some of them months before the outbreak,\u201d said one of the people who witnessed the withdrawal of u.s. personnel. \u201cyou have to consider the possibility that our drawdown made this catastrophe more likely or more difficult to respond to.\u201d the white house declined to comment or respond to questions \nfrom reuters regarding the u.s withdrawal of staff in china. the cdc did not respond to detailed questions submitted by reuters about the cuts. it has insisted its staffing levels did not hinder the u.s. response to the coronavirus. \u201cthere are many factors that go into decisions around staffing,\u201d the cdc said in a statement. some health experts were skeptical that more cdc employees operating inside china would have made a difference in stemming the outbreak. beijing has been widely criticized for silencing its own public health officials who warned of a deadly new respiratory disease emanating from the chinese city of wuhan and surrounding hubei province. \u201cthe problem was china, not that we didn\u2019t have cdc people in china,\u201d said scott mcnabb, a former cdc epidemiologist who is now a research professor with emory university. he pointed to china\u2019s censorship as the main culprit in the spread of the pandemic, which has infected at least 435,470 people worldwide, killed 19,598 and upended the global economy. china\u2019s embassy in washington, d.c. declined to comment. the nsf closed all foreign offices in 2018, according to spokesman robert margetta. he said the agency planned on \u201csending teams on short-term expeditions around the world to find ways to increase international collaborations.\u201d a usaid spokesman said the decision to shutter its beijing office was \u201cdue to significantly decreased access to chinese government officials as well as the agency\u2019s position that the chinese model of development is not aligned with u.s. values and interests.\u201d the usda confirmed that it moved a manager position out of beijing. a spokesman said the department has retained an office in china that employs eight people: five americans and three chinese. the office monitors animal disease and helps resolve \u201ctrade-related issues as they occur at chinese ports of entry,\u201d the spokesman said. reuters first reported about changes to cdc staffing in china on sunday. the news agency revealed that the trump administration had eliminated the position of a u.s. trainer of chinese field epidemiologists, who were deployed to the epicenter of outbreaks to help track, investigate and contain diseases. in a press briefing on sunday, trump criticized the reuters story as \u201c100 percent wrong.\u201d yet the cdc acknowledged the position had been cut. the agency said the decision was made because of china\u2019s \u201cexcellent technical capability,\u201d and said the elimination of that post did not hamper the u.s. effort to respond to the coronavirus outbreak. the cdc staffing documents newly reviewed by reuters show a sharp decline in the overall number of employees at the agency in beijing, with 33 out of 47 positions lost. the documents show the breakdown between american and chinese staffers. the number of so-called american \u201cassignees\u201d declined to three positions from eight at the outset of the administration. positions lost included medical epidemiologists and other experts in infectious diseases. the \nbiggest cuts were to positions filled by chinese employees on the u.s. payroll, down to around 10 from 40 over the same period. many of those local hires included medical and disease experts, according to the people who spoke with reuters. \u201clocal staffers stayed even longer at the cdc and had a real depth of knowledge,\u201d one of the people said. \u201cthere\u2019s a loss of deep expertise and institutional knowledge.\u201d the cdc told reuters the three americans currently on staff in china are a country director, an influenza expert and an information technology expert. a temporary deputy director arrived recently, and that job will be filled permanently, the agency said in a statement. in addition, two chinese staffers continue to work on specific public health areas, including the training program, according to the statement. the shuttered usaid and nsf offices in china also had a role in building scientific relationships and combating global disease, according to the four people familiar with the situation. usaid\u2019s beijing office, which was staffed by a senior u.s. officer and two chinese employees, was working on initiatives including multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and malaria, the people said. the office closed in 2019. the nsf office was once led by nancy sung, a respected american scientist who was a key link between the u.s. and chinese scientific communities, according to the u.s. government official who spoke with reuters. the office also employed two local staffers. \u201cshe had far more contacts than most of us,\u201d said the official, who had been in china at the time and was familiar with her role. \u201cshe could have helped maintain vital channels of communication between the two countries which to this day is greatly curtailed.\u201d sung, who is now with the nsf in the united states, declined to comment about the closure of her office in 2018 and referred questions to the agency\u2019s public affairs office. the changes came amid escalating tensions between washington and beijing. trump has long complained that china has stolen millions of american jobs and intellectual property, charges the chinese government has rejected as baseless. the countries have slapped billions in tariffs on each other\u2019s goods. now their leaders are battling to control the narrative over the pandemic. trump has called it the \u201cchinese virus\u201d to keep the focus on china\u2019s role in unleashing the pandemic. china, meanwhile, is trying to assert global leadership by providing aid to italy and other hard-hit countries. over the last two years, the white house has pushed u.s. agencies with a presence in china to de-fund programs there along with the positions to manage them, according to the u.s. official who spoke to reuters. the source said terry branstad, the u.s. ambassador to china and a former republican governor of iowa, tried to remind the white house of the importance of the u.s. presence in china but was told to \u201cget with the program\u201d by an administration official. \u201cthe white house saw \nthe relationship as one-sided and without benefit to the u.s.,\u201d the source said. a state department spokesman said in a statement that the u.s. embassy in china is \u201cone of our largest, reflecting the many areas of bilateral engagement.\u201d \u201csince ambassador branstad\u2019s arrival, the u.s. mission to china has maintained robust staffing to advance important foreign policy goals on behalf of the american people,\u201d the statement said. \u201cstaffing levels for the numerous federal agencies and sections have, on the whole, held steady and in some cases increased.\u201d after reuters\u2019 story about the elimination of the key cdc position in china ran on sunday, trump\u2019s re-election campaign seized on it for fundraising. in a mass email to supporters, it accused trump\u2019s critics of \u201csiding with the chinese\u201d and helping beijing with a \u201ccover-up.\u201d the cdc on monday told reuters that redfield had decided to add a

Airlines are no longer flying to China, the ribbons of VW and BMW in the country are still quiet, Apple temporarily closes his business there: the concern is growing prior to economic consequences of novel lung disease. \"With the further spread of the coronavirus within China and beyond in Asia, the economic costs will increase,\" says DIW President Marcel Fratzscher. Although the economic consequences according to economists can not be estimated. But they are likely to be more violent than at the infectious disease SARS 17 years ago, which had also broken out in China. The economic importance of the country has since grown immensely. The meanwhile second largest economy in the world is an important export market for \"Made in Germany\". At the same time, German industrial companies produce there, manufacturers relate parts from the country for their production. \"What happens in China today has greater importance for the world than before,\" Coaches Econom Holger Schmieding, Chief Volkswirt of Berenberg Bank. According to the IFO economic expert Timo Wollersh\u00e4user, \"the economic consequences are likely to be stronger than the SARS EPEDEMIE\". SARS did about China about one percent growth of gross domestic product. In the German numbers, that was practically not depressed. \"Since then, the economic importance of the country has grown, the infection numbers are higher and the Chinese government responds harder.\" Beijing fights with drastic measures against the spread of the virus. In the crisis region in Central China, 45 million people are cut off in several cities from the outside world by cutting the transport links. Other cities in the People's Republic have exposed overland connections with buses as well as reduced the number of flights and trains. The virus meets the Chinese economy - as well as the global economy as a whole - just in a weakness phase. \"The longer the state of emergency - say: the travel ban in China - stops and the further the virus spreads, the grave enders will be the economic impact on the global economy\", analyze economists of Commerzbank. No good perspectives for the export-oriented German economy. Similarly, the foreign trade association BGA sees. \"Should the situation continue to tip, this will no longer have negative consequences only for the Chinese economy, but world trade,\" says BGA President Holger Bingmann. \"The interruption of flight connections, the closure of operations or even the absence of tourists already show effect.\" The concern also applies to the supply relationships between companies. \"Should the production stops in the Chinese industry last longer, the international supply chains would also be threatened,\" explains Klaus-J\u00fcrgen \nFrom the Institute for World Economy in Kiel. \"The importance of China as a supplier for the rest of the world is considerable.\" For a long standstill, especially supply chains in the chemistry, in vehicle construction, in the textile industry and electronics interrupting, warn economists of alliance. Manufacturers also received in Germany no longer needed, they would have to find alternatives or shut down their production. At the same time, China is an important export market for German products. Meanwhile, Commerzbank is about 7 percent of German exports to the country - mainly cars and car parts as well as machines. The German carmakers alone make Fratzscher a third of their profits in China. Conversely, Germany imports into data processing equipment as well as electrical equipment. So far, the consequences seem to be kept within limits. Because of the holidays around the Chinese New Year - this year on January 25, production was limited anyway. \"The current outbreak of the coronavirus has at the present time only regionally limited effects on the business company of DB Schenker,\" says, for example, a spokeswoman of Deutsche Bahn. However, freight forwarders complain that customs demands lasted by the measures of the Chinese authorities. In addition, freight capacities in passenger aircraft, because numerous airlines China no longer start. Currently, freight forwarders could be partially offset by transfers, but for higher freight costs for the shipper, explains the Federal Association of Spedition and Logistics.

mask and accompanied by a retinue of military and health officials, xi - who initially came under criticism for not acting in time to stem the virus when it first showed up in december last year, but later won praise for a decisive follow-up action - visited a makeshift hospital and community residents and frontline workers in wuhan. xi, 66, vowed to resolutely fight for a victory in the war

lockdown of the city and the central hubei province with 50 million people. xi, also general secretary of the ruling communist party of china (cpc) and head of the military, called for firm, solid and meticulous prevention and control efforts to defend hubei and wuhan. the coronavirus has become a major challenge to xi's leadership who is often referred to as china's most powerful leader after the cpc founder mao zedong, with the prospect of life-long tenure in power. after over three-month long battle against the virus, china has come to a grinding halt with estimated losses of over usd 103 billion. the virus has also caused acute distress among \npeople as china locked down the hubei province while implemented stringent measures all over the country including closure of factories and offices to contain the virus. xi said after hard work, the situation in hubei and wuhan had shown positive changes with important progress, but the prevention and control task remain arduous. he praised the sacrifices of people of wuhan and hubei province. the positive trend in preventing and controlling the virus could not have been achieved without the sacrifice, devotion, perseverance and hard efforts of the people of wuhan, xi said. with their concrete actions, wuhan people have demonstrated the strength and spirit of china, as well as the chinese people's love for the family and the nation, which enables them to stick together through thick and thin, he said. after his arrival in wuhan, xi went straight to huoshenshan hospital, the 1000-bed makeshift hospital built in record time of less than 10 days to inspect thousands of cases. china also built another 1300-bed hospital equally in record time, rushed over 30,000 medical staff from the military as well as from all over to treat the spiralling number of cases. the official media reported with the cases falling in big numbers, all the makeshift hospitals numbering over 14 are now being dismantled in wuhan. at the hospital, xi greeted medical staff through television monitor and learned about community-based efforts for epidemic prevention and control, xinhua reported. he also visited residents of a community in wuhan who are subject to self-quarantine, looking into the community-level prevention and control work as well as daily necessity supply. xi's visit sent a strong signal to the entire country and the world that china is ascending out of the darkest moment amid the outbreak, and the battle against the epidemic has now entered the next stage, state-run global times quoted analysts assaying. xi's wuhan visit at this moment shows the turning point of china's domestic fight against the epidemic has arrived and now the fight is shifting its focus to prevent imported cases of infection and gradually resume economic activities and production, analysts said. lu keli, an associate professor at the school of marxism studies in the renmin university of china in beijing told the global times that xi's visit showed that china had achieved a phased victory at the current juncture that can help effectively stabilise and control the epidemic situation.

For safety, they have decided to celebrate the new year separately. \" Although she was small, she Wu Han has engraved in her memory the memory of SARS, which also emerged in China in 2002 and caused more than 700 dead around the world after becoming a global pandemic. \"At school they measured the temperature constantly and the classrooms sterilized every day,\" she recalls. \"I hope it does not happen again anything similar\". At Hu Shan's house, on the contrary, parties will be lived normally. She, who also lives in Beijing, advanced the dates of her visit to spend more time with her parents and now she does not know when she can come back. \"I have spent the last four days at home, but when I left for the first time and I saw the deserted streets I was aware of the severity of the situation,\" explains the 25-year-old girl. The parents of it have not been a panic. \"My mother tried to go buy supplies a couple of days ago, but when she came to the supermarket and she saw the size of her tail simply she turned around.\" They also do not argue much about the outbreak between them, they limit themselves to \"share articles with action advice in the family chat\". Today they will have dinner like any other Chinese new year, all three together, and then they will sit on the couch to see the national television gala.

The contagion has taken place \"in an interval in which the Chinesin was still symptom-free\", said, said President of the President of Zapf. The novel coronavirus 2019-NCOV can trigger a lung disease, which has already died more than 100 people in the main distribution country China - most of them were older patients with severe pre-existing conditions. Transfers before symptoms occur are considered very rare. Especially in the case in Bavaria is also that it is one of previously three known detections worldwide, where the contagion happened outside of China. So far, almost all of the approximately 50 acquired infections in France, the US, Thailand and other Asian countries were imported cases. The people concerned had infected with a trip to China. In Vietnam, there was the country's authorities \nA human-to-human transfer outside China between father and son. In Japan, a first-day transfer was reported on Tuesday.

The total number of globally known diseases has now risen to more than 4500 after Chinese state television reported a jump on Tuesday by more than 1700 cases compared to the previous day. Alone in the particularly difficult Hubei province, there were also 24 more deaths, so that nationwide at least 106 people had died of lung disease. The new 2019-NCOV virus is originally probably from a market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where it was probably overwhelmed by wild animals on humans. There is no protective vaccination or a special therapy for the treatment of the disease. The symptoms - including dry cough, fever and respiratory distress - but can be mitigated with medicines. According to the current assessment of experts, the novel lung disease is apparently in most cases mild, possibly even without symptoms. The new pathogen is very similar to the virus behind the SARS epidemic 2002/2003. At that time, after data from the World Health Organization, it had given nine evidence in Germany between November 2002 and July 2003.

More than 8,000 secured cases in more than 20 countries, almost 200 dead: The new Coronavirus 2019-NCOV has long since become an international problem. But is the outbreak officially an international health nightstand? In order to decide, a committee of the World Health Organization WHO today had to ask the following questions: like most experts, the committee of the WHO was also the opinion that all these questions have to be answered with yes and exclaimed the emergency. The amazing thing is that the decision to the committee is anything but lightweight. Only in the second start and after long discussions, the Director-General of WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus decided. Why only hesitate? Why was the decision so a politician, and what does this emergency mean? To first raise a misunderstanding: the WHO's decision is not a risk assessment. The fact that the WHO now exclaims the health nightstand is not because she holds the new coronavirus for more dangerous than on 22 January, as a first emergency meeting took place. The novel coronavirus made scientists from the beginning. Since January 13, there are cases outside of China. Meanwhile, one knows that the virus has been transferred to man for some time, probably since mid-December (New England Journal of Medicine: Li et al., 2020). The virus has not become abrupt threatening, just because the WHO exclaims an emergency. The exclamation of a health nightstand is something else: very simplified it leads to the WHO gets more powers. She does not advise as usual the affected countries, but begins to coordinate health measures. Through the emergency, \"skills to the WHO and the community of stunning are issued,\" explains Maike Voss, who works at the Foundation Science and Politics on Global Health issues. In 2005, 196 states have agreed on international health regulations (they). Since then, the World Health Organization (WHO) has spent a five times a health care of international scope (Pheic): so countries, if the emergency was proclaimed, justify what they do in terms of health. China could now explain within 48 hours, why it makes sense for the health of the population to set whole cities under quarantine. The same applies if countries close limits or stop trading. So - that too is the idea behind the international health novel - should be ensured that food or medication continues to come to affected places. At the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities of the World Health Organization WHO reported an accumulation of pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause in the Central Chinese city of Wuhan. already identified a week later \nChinese researchers a novel virus as the cause of the diseases. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days then a group released a group of the virologen Christian's premier from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 the first diagnostic test for the new virus, the researcher provisionally call 2019-NCOV. With the test, the virus can be detected in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, on which, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected. Both the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as well as Mers (MIDDLE East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses which have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more than 750 died. With the MERS virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronaviruses. Many of them relate to respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example. In China, several thousand persons are suffering from them, some of them - most of them with pre-existing conditions - have died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first infection cases outside of China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been in Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection with a tourist, who came back from Wuhan, on January 24, the first cases were known in France. Meanwhile, first cases were confirmed in Germany. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. The virus can cause pneumonia that can endally end. Since it is a viral illness, antibiotics do not help. Meanwhile, it is clear that the virus can be transferred from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transfers after a dozen cases were known in medical staff. Medizors assume that the virus is transmitted above all over droplet infection. The World Health Organization calculates, as announced on January 24, at the moment that an infected one cuts 1.4 to 2.5 other people. Contest these numbers, the virus is less contagious than SARS and also the viral flu. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals. That can not be said yet. The World Health Organization announced on January 28, that about one-fifth of the reported cases through the virus will be seriously ill, in case of doubt, so intensively medicine \nmust be treated. According to reports, the first death pots were patients who had some severe pre-existing conditions. Even with other infectious diseases, people with pre-existing diseases are particularly endangered - for example at the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so change their genome. This can cause you to become more dangerous for people in the course of an outbreak - but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) expects no similar mortality to the current time as the outbreak of SARS. Although the declaration of a health nightstand is not a wonder weapon, writing medical lawyers in a now published article (Jama: Phelan et al., 2020). But she is a \"strong signal to the international community\". The WHO Director-General and many experts hope for the decision that even countries benefit with weaker health systems, the coronavirus should arrive at them. On top of that, the emergency is also an intervention in the sovereignty of a state and thus always a politician. In the case of Coronavirus 2019-NCOV in China, he is even highly political. China tried to show the world with the massive curvature measures that it has the emergency to control, Maike Voss said: \"Health protection is always a sign of political assertiveness.\" China wanted to show the world that no help needs. In a phase in which it is in the trade conflict with the US and with the new Silk Road initiative shows its economic power throughout the world, it does not want to show weakness. In addition there is something else: In the past, the health novelty was often proclaimed in situations where the affected areas and countries urgently needed money and help, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo in the fight against Ebola. Or because it urgently had to be researched into a pathogen, for example at the 2016 Zika virus. But both do not apply to the coronavirus outbreak: China demonstrates that it comes with its own forces in the fight against the outbreak very far. And researchers worldwide have compiled immense amounts of data on the virus in recent weeks and shared with the WHO. The Director-General of WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, is likely to have been torn against the background of all of whom: purely legally he had to exclude a health nesting. On the other hand, the emergency - so the fear of many - to set the so important cooperation with the Chinese government, which has previously readily shared data and laboratory samples with the WHO and other countries. Collaboration that Ghebreyesus wanted to reaffirm with his visit to China and in talks with the head of state Xi Jinping in recent days. And so it also fits that Ghebreyesus after the last \nHealthNotstand meeting said he sturgeon that there is only yes or no at the question of the emergency stand and nothing in between. And that in today's press conference, he said twice, the declaration was \"no distrust vote against China\". It was the politician Ghebreyesus, who stressed - in a situation in which it was clear: also health can be a very political topic.

(both have had more localised outbreaks, and mers in particular is less contagious than covid-19.) but the fact is that covid-19 is more than contagious and deadly enough to be the first truly globalised public health crisis in decades. any such crisis will have consequences. the most obvious way to manage covid-19 at a community level, according to experts, now that it is loose and before a vaccine is developed, is greater 'social distancing'. at worst, this might ensure that not too many develop the symptoms at the same time, and allow the health care system to better deal with the intake of new patients. what does social distancing mean? essentially, people will need to stay away from other people. but the world economy is not run from people's homes. social distancing -- working from home, reducing travel, reducing large group interaction, and so on -- will naturally reduce output where it is implemented. if there is an outbreak in an area that is a hub for global supply chains, such as southern china, then that reduction in output will cascade through the global economy. some sectors -- aviation, for example -- will be disproportionately affected. here is where the hidden assumption about government action comes in. if output has decreased, this assumption suggests, then government must do something to restore it to its 'natural' level. expansive fiscal or monetary policy is essential, according to this line of thinking. this is just silly. a pandemic like covid-19 is not creating excess capacity in the economy which can respond to government stimulus. the recommended public health measures in fact actually reduce potential output (for however long they are in effect). this is not to say, for example, that some central banks need not take action. most importantly, the covid-19 shock should not freeze up financial markets. the european central bank, for example, has said it will ensure that banks have the liquidity they need to keep lending. the us federal reserve has also infused $1.5 \ntrillion of liquidity, but it also made a surprise cut to interest rates by 50 basis points. it is not clear to anyone what the latter is supposed to achieve; the stock market, certainly, did not appear to be notably more enthusiastic after the cut than before. nor can increased government spending, in and of itself, help. a generalised fiscal stimulus is intended to get people to up spending. this is not what we want at this time -- especially if 'spending' is inversely correlated with social distance. what might be useful instead is targeted assistance to those sectors and individuals that are disproportionately affected. south korea -- a country that was affected early on and which has had an exemplary response on most levels -- put into place an emergency child care subsidy and support for specific smaller enterprises. the international monetary fund has recommended a set of such temporary transfers and tax relief. the purpose here is not to 'make up' for or counteract the effects of the coronavirus; it is to ensure that the damage to the economy is not lasting, and that individuals and viable businesses have resources to survive an unknowably long period of lower potential output and sector-specific stress. it is unfortunate that finance minister nirmala sitharaman, who largely resisted calls for a generalised stimulus in the union budget, said in reference to a stimulus on friday that the government is 'moving on that front'. this will raise expectations of a generalised demand stimulus that should not be raised. hopefully whatever measures are taken, when they are taken, will not be directed towards raising overall economy activity but will merely provide some temporary sustenance to imperilled sectors. covid-19 is not like the 2008 global financial crisis. it is a crisis of a very different sort. you can't spend your way out of it. there are other things the government should do -- working on real preparedness of india's under-resourced health sector -- and it should focus on those.

alerting americans to take precautions, some health agencies charged with protecting the public appear unprepared to deal with the threat.       barely more than a handful of public health departments across the country are able to test for the novel virus, which began in china and has spread to at least 44 countries. the federal government has less than\u00a010% of the protective masks required to protect healthcare workers and the public. and washington still does not have adequate funding in place to support health departments' efforts, though more money is on the way.       conflicting messaging from the white house and top u.s. officials regarding the severity of the threat has only added to the uncertainty.       the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) this week for the first time advised american businesses, schools, hospitals and families to prepare for domestic acceleration of the virus, which has infected more than 80,000 people worldwide and killed nearly 3,000.       president donald trump on wednesday assured americans that the risk of coronavirus transmission in the united states was \"very low.\" despite an explosion of cases in china over the past two months, the trump administration only this week put in a request for $2.5 billion to aid in the response, an amount both republicans and democrats have said is too small.       critics of the federal response say the united states squandered precious weeks by focusing too narrowly on keeping the coronavirus from crossing u.s. borders rather than marshalling resources to prepare american communities for a widespread domestic outbreak that officials now say was inevitable.       \"this has been a realistic risk for a month, and the signal to trigger that kind of preparedness has only been going out in the last few days in an explicit way,\" said jeremy konyndyk, a senior policy fellow at the center for global development in washington. \"that's a huge problem.\"          few being tested       there are 60 confirmed u.s. cases of the novel coronavirus, which causes the disease known as covid-19, u.s. health officials said on wednesday. but experts admit they have no way of knowing the true figure because access to testing at present is severely limited.       so far, the u.s. strategy has focused almost exclusively on testing infected travelers, using a test that looks for genetic material from the virus in saliva or mucus. as of february 23, fewer than 500 people from 43 states had been or are being tested for the virus.       currently, just seven state and local health departments have the ability to screen for the virus, the association of public health laboratories (aphl) said on wednesday. cdc-developed tests issued three weeks ago were producing inaccurate results in some labs, so new tests had to be \nmade and cleared by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda), leaving many labs with no local testing capability, the group said.       the cdc and fda have worked out a fix that will allow 40 more public health labs to do testing by the end of next week, the aphl's chief executive scott becker told reuters.       in the meantime, the burden has fallen largely on the cdc, which does testing for most of the country on its campus in atlanta.       \"unfortunately, we are now in the bottom tier in countries capable of doing population-based testing,\" said dr. michael osterholm, director of the center for infectious disease research and policy at the university of minnesota.       u.s. patients typically wait 24 to 48 hours to find out whether they have tested positive and need to be quarantined, health officials said, during which time those who are infected can spread the virus to others.       the cdc's test is restricted solely for use by public health labs, but if the virus begins spreading widely in the united states, hospitals will need to be able to do the tests themselves, public health experts say. such testing is typically done using kits produced by commercial companies. several privately developed tests are in the works, but none have yet won approval from the fda.       some health experts also fault the narrow testing criteria that the united states is using to screen for potential infections. currently, individuals with flu-like symptoms are only tested for the coronavirus if they have traveled to a country where the virus is spreading. this has raised concerns that there are far more cases in the united states than are currently recorded.       \"if the majority of testing is all around airports or travelers, we won't know whether it's circulating in communities,\" said dr. tom inglesby, director of the center for health security of the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health.       those worries were reinforced on wednesday when the cdc confirmed the first u.s. case of coronavirus in a california patient with no apparent travel history. the university of california davis said in a statement the patient was transferred to the hospital with severe pneumonia and the hospital requested testing. but since the patient didn't fit the cdc's criteria, those tests were delayed by several days.       on thursday, cdc said it is broadening those criteria to allow testing when the virus is suspected.       masks in short supply       around 15 state health departments contacted by reuters raised concerns about challenges they would face in the event of community spread, including worries about not having enough personal protective gear to safeguard frontline medical workers.       the u.s. department of health and human services on tuesday estimated that the united states would need 300 million face masks to protect healthcare workers and the public from people infected with the virus. the country has fewer than 20 million of the kind of \nmasks needed to protect healthcare workers in the strategic national stockpile, a government repository of medical supplies needed to address public health emergencies.       \"there is a real concern the availability of this equipment may be limited, in part because of the public buying it in a panic when they don't need it,\" said matt zavadsky, head of the national association of emergency medical technicians.       president donald trump's administration is considering invoking special powers through a law called the defense production act to quickly expand domestic manufacturing of protective masks and clothing to combat the coronavirus in the united states, two u.s. officials told reuters.       with no covid-19 vaccine or proven anti-viral medicine available, states are planning to isolate sick people in their homes, both to slow community spread and reduce pressure on hospitals, according to the cdc.       their ability to track a rapidly expanding web of patients who test positive, and all the people with whom they have had contact, is of major concern, according to chief epidemiologists in several states.       health departments in some states have purchased disease surveillance software to help them with that task. the state of washington's system, for instance, tracks patients and people they have had contact with, and asks them about their condition. if someone reports symptoms that merit hospitalization, the patient and doctors are informed of that.       the cdc said in a news conference on tuesday that transmission of the virus could be slowed by the closure of schools and businesses and the cancellations of concerts and other mass gatherings.       but exactly who would make those decisions or how they would be enforced isn't clear and could vary widely throughout the nation.       in texas, for example, such decisions may be made by local officials, said chris van deus, a spokesman with the texas health department.       \"texas is a home rule state so the buck really stops with county judges and mayors,\" van deus said.       another concern is a flood of patients into health systems that are already overburdened in many parts of the country, particularly during winter flu season.       washington state is considering temporary drive-through care facilities to stop potential coronavirus carriers entering healthcare facilities, mindful that hospitals can amplify outbreaks, as was\u00a0the case with the viruses that cause mers and sars.       new mexico is working with healthcare systems to turn outpatient facilities into care units if needed, said state epidemiologist michael landen.       \"the biggest challenge is getting a consistent message to the public with respect to their options with dealing with this virus,\" landen said. reuters ", "label": 1},

It is the most trafficked mammal in the world but will be very little known in the West. An investigation of scientists from the South China agricultural university and the Lingnan Science and Agricultural Science and Technology Laboratory in Guangdong Province, concluded that Pangolim is an intermediate host potential for the new coronavirus identified in December in China. This can be an important step for the prevention and control of the outbreak.\nThe new coronavirus journey could have started on the bat, past the Pangolim and reached the human to humans. This is a hypothesis that was raised by researchers this Friday. The connection is presented after a team of Chinese scientists advertised that he has found a strain of a virus in the Pangolim that will have 99% of genetic similarities with the new coronavirus that is infecting humans.\nPangolim is the most trafficked mammal, although protected by international laws given that it is a threatened species. The meat of these animals is considered an delicacy in countries such as China and their scales are used in traditional medicine.\n\"This last discovery will be of great importance for the prevention and control of origin (virus),\" said the agricultural university of southern China, who led the investigation, in a statement published on his official website. The first molecular biology tests began to reveal only the presence of coronavirus in the Pangolim. However, after being isolated and genetically sequenced the virus detected in the animals, the results were compared with the data that already exist on the genome of the new coronavirus that is infecting tens of thousands of people around the world, but especially in China.\nSubscribe newsletters for free and receive the best of the publicity and the deepest jobs of the public.\nThere are eight known species of Pangolim (four in Africa and four in Asia), although some scientists advocate that there may be more species that have not been officially identified. The Portuguese scientist Augustine Antunes, a professor at the Faculty of Science at the University of Porto and Researcher at Ciimar (Interdisciplinary Center for Marine and Environmental Research) Study Pangolim for more than ten years, having participated (among other works) in the first sequencing of his genome . Contacted by the public, the expert had not yet had aware of the possible link between this animal and the new coronavirus. Given that it is an animal that is consumed in China, the specialist risks that this link is a plausible hypothesis. However, Augustine Antunes warns that the same connection (between pangolim and humans) was suggested in the case of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in 2003 and eventually prove that, after all, this coronavirus had \"skipped\" of the bats to the humans.\nPangolim has the body covered with scales, which are used in traditional Chinese medicine for some diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Some people also believe that their scales have aphrodisiac properties. This animal, when threatened, adopts a coiled form, similar to that of the hedgehog. It has no teeth and feeds, above all, ants.

dissonant babble of politicians all struggling, in their own way, to cope with the manifold challenges posed by the virus, from its crushing burden on hospitals and health care workers to its economic devastation and rising death toll.   the choir also lacks a conductor, a role played through most of the post-world war ii era by the united states.   us president donald trump has failed to work with other leaders to fashion a common response, preferring to promote his border wall over the scientific advice of his own medical experts.   in an oval office address wednesday (march 11) night, he imposed a 30-day ban on travel from europe to the us, claiming, without evidence, that the european union\u2019s lax initial response had brought more cases of the virus across the atlantic, with \u201ca large number of new clusters\u201d seeded by travelers from the continent.   mr trump\u2019s secretary of state, mike pompeo, has taken to calling the contagion the \u201cwuhan virus,\u201d vilifying the country where it originated and complicating efforts to coordinate a global response.   the same denigration of science and urge to block outsiders has characterized leaders from china to iran, as well as right-wing populists in europe, which is sowing cynicism and leaving people uncertain of whom to believe.   far from trying to stamp out the virus, strongmen like president vladimir putin of russia and crown prince mohammed bin salman of saudi arabia have seized on the upheaval it is causing as cover for steps to consolidate their power.   yet it is too simple to lay all this at mr trump\u2019s door or on world leaders collectively. part of the problem is simply the fiendish nature of the pathogen.   covid-19\u00a0has resisted the tools that countries have brought to bear against previous global scourges. mysterious in its transmission and relentless in its spread, it has led countries to try wildly divergent responses.   the lack of common standards on testing, on the cancellation of public gatherings and on quarantines have deepened the anxiety of people and eroded confidence in their leaders.   the simultaneous shocks to supply and demand \u2014 shuttered iphone factories in china; empty gondolas in venice, italy; and passengers abandoning cruises, hotels and airlines \neverywhere else \u2014 are a new phenomenon that may not respond to the weapons

\u201cnonstarter\u201d by house democrats, who scrambled instead to introduce legislation to provide financial help to patients, workers and families affected by the fast-moving epidemic and speed it to a house vote thursday.   to mr haass, the intense focus on limiting the economic blow was understandable, given the carnage in the markets, but premature.   he said countries needed to put their energy into slowing and mitigating the spread of the virus before they embarked on fiscal programs to repair the economic damage.   the trouble is that, with few exceptions, their efforts have been hapless.   in the us, the delay in developing coronavirus test kits and the scarcity of tests has made it impossible for officials, even weeks after the first cases appeared in the country, to get a true picture of the scale of the outbreak.   in hard-hit italy, quarrels broke out between politicians and medical experts over whether authorities were testing too many people in lombardy, inflating the infection figures and fueling panic in the public.   italy\u2019s response could be weakened further by the anti-vaccination movement that was once embraced by the populist 5-star movement, which took power in the last government.   even comparing one country\u2019s case count to another\u2019s is almost impossible, given the different testing procedures and diagnostic criteria around the world, said dr\u00a0chris smith, a specialist in virology at the university of cambridge.   in the most extreme example, china\u2019s case count skyrocketed when it began recording positives based on people\u2019s symptoms, rather than a lab test, the method most countries are still using.   but even lab tests might yield different results in different places, depending on the targets labs are using and the ways health workers collect and process \nspecimens.   \u201cdifferent countries are doing different things,\u201d dr smith said of the testing programmes. \u201cyou\u2019re not comparing apples to apples.\u201d   the rise of populism has exacerbated the problem by reducing the incentives of countries to cooperate. european leaders, in a three-hour teleconference tuesday night, agreed to set up a 25 billion euro (s$39.6\u00a0billion) investment fund and to relax rules governing airlines to curb the economic fallout.   but they failed to overcome national objections to sharing medical equipment like face masks and respirators, given that health issues are the responsibility of national governments. germany, the czech republic and other countries have tightened export restrictions on this gear to keep it for their own citizens.   chancellor angela merkel\u2019s warning that the virus would infect 60\u00a0to 70 per cent\u00a0of people in germany \u2014 a

If we have contact with someone from Wuhan, we have orders to stay 15 days without leaving home and informing the authorities about possible changes in body temperature or fever, \"explains Portuguese.\nAs a precautionary measure, Cirque du Soleil was required to close doors and cancel the shows to \"not allow large groups from other cities to join\" in the same place.

He added: \"All calm and calm because there is no transmission on this continent. Cases of patients were disclosed in the United States and others in Mexico, but these are people who visited China, they have been isolated and have not been able to propagate the pathology, for which they have not generated transmission. \" He explained that at the end of December 2019, the Chinese City of Wuhan declared a group of cases infected with an unknown respiratory disease, one week later was determined that it was a new strain of Coronavirus that identified it as a respiratory syndrome with the name of 2019-ncov. He valued as positive rapidity in identifying the general features of pathology and said that the Coronavirus are present in some animals that have transmitted it to humans. It is an extensive family of viruses, some of which can be a cause of various diseases in men, ranging from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome. The epidemiologist also asserted that as in China there is a transmission, the authorities apply measures collected in the International Health Regulations approved in 2005 and effectively as of 2007 that protocolizes acting before an unknown eventuality. He stressed: \"We must be calm because the new Coronavirus is not highly transmissible. What is confirmed is that there is a human to human transmission, but everything is under scientific research, \"and argued that statistics relate about 2,000 people with about 80 deaths in recent days. These deaths are also related to chronic base diseases than when attacked by a virus, destabilizes the organism. \"The transmission of this disease, according to the information that comes to us, is quite smaller than for example an influenza or a measles,\" he said. He pointed out that on January 22, WHO summoned a meeting of experts who continued the next day. \"They advise the Director General to declare or not an international public health emergency. At the conclusion of the meeting, the decision of that committee is that there is still not enough information to declare an international public health emergency, \"said the official. In its criteria, our country is prepared to face this and any other event that is presented: \"You have a health system with coverage for one hundred percent of the population, a broad network based on family doctors based on The neighborhoods and communities.

In total, 2,761 cases confirmed in Chinese territory and 51 recovered patients (2 more than Sunday) M than to include the whole country, with a single exception of the autonomous region of Tibet. 39 cases of people infected in 11 foreign countries are reported, in this case US (5), Japan (4), South Korea (4), Thailand (7), Singapore (4); While the figures are maintained in Viet Nam (2), France (3), Nepal (1), Australia (4), Malaysia (3), Canada (1). They are not reported to date died abroad. We have witnessed the rapid and forceful response of the Chinese authorities, both at the central and local level, in union of the noble and heroic Chinese people, which once again close ranks in favor of saving lives and avoiding the spread of the disease. The situation continues to be of a highest priority, an integral and timely strategy of prevention and control to which new measures are added to both national and local level to give battle to this unique pandemic. Our thanks to Chinese authorities and also to friends who from social networks and Chinese media Nios maintains informed and provide us with their valuable support in facilitating the work that corresponds to us as embassies in coordination and follow-up to the situation of all our nationals in China. From the same start, the Embassy of Cuba in the People's Republic of China and the Cuban consulates in Shanghai and Guangzhou have maintained permanent and systematic communication with all our nationals, alerting on this epidemic outbreak and putting into force the hygienic-sanitary measures aimed at Avoid cases of contagion. We continue very closely the situation of each partner, including those who remain in the city of Wuhan today. I confirm that no Cuban personnel affected in any region of the country are not reported so far. As we reiterate today with the collective of our Embassy and Cuban representation offices in China, as well as in our exchanges with the Association of Cubans residing in China, it is key in this minute to jealously comply with the different measures adopted such as: -Mantener The greatest possible hygiene in terms of frequent washing of hands and with plenty of water and soap. -dispose of antiseptic with alcohol and chlorine and use it to disinfect the surfaces with which we have contact, as well as the use of chlorine for cleaning \nfrom the floor. -using disposable napkins and wet wipes for it (do not wear cloth cloths) -evit agglomerations, contacts person to person and unnecessary visits or outputs. -Ewater food and water only in duly certified places. - Always always the mask and as much as possible to protect your eyes with glasses or glasses. -aphate the heating at night. -Lock the clothes with hot water. -Airear daily the apartments and the rooms. -Ubine the clothes used abroad at the first step of entrance to the house or bedrooms in the case of students (coats, clothes and shoes). -Take abundant water and vitamin c. Eat well. -Reitate that the incubation period is 1 to 14 days and that during this period the person may seem healthy and be transmitting the virus. Serve this message also to reiterate all our compatriots the importance of staying in touch with our embassy and consulates. Likewise, to move our family and friends fully confidence that all the necessary measures are adopted today to face the epidemic.

", "label": 1}, {"content": "The viruses and we. What is a disease? The first, seemingly simple and extremely scandalous explanation: The disease is a fact. She is the real thing that can happen to a human being. The disease, as you say, brings him back to the bottom of the facts. From all areas of politics, economics and culture to the body. His powerful anger against nature or against the gods and perhaps to a new form of humility. The subjective answer to the immoral, unreasonable and unesthetic fact of the disease is a biographical and social truth. The reality of the disease leads to a truth of their subjects. It comes to a person like a society, not alone on the disease, but also how to deal with her, how to get it, as you encounter what you change through them and not. So the disease is a second: a mirror, a picture, a comment. She forces a truth, from a person or from a society. Of course, it comes to what kind it is. The three main forms of the disease are the hereditary disease, which is already predetermined by fate and family novel, the arbitrary illness, such as cancer or dementia (\"every human being can catch it\"), and finally the contagious disease that is spread and the one \"itself Bring \"when contacting other people and with the traces of their lives. That's not done for a long time. There are civilization diseases that attract because one behaves so wrong, as many in their own society do as well, false diet, wrong movement, false emotions - stress or boredom. And conversely, the poor diseases, caused and favored due to a general weakening due to food problems, fatigue, hygienic circumstances, and poisoning diseases, ordinary or unusual drugs. Dismant and industry at the same time bring progress and poison waste and psychosocial diseases (\"what's argues ill\"). Unnecessary to say: The edges of these diseases are out of focus, many forms are indirectly linked and often enough masks a form than the other. Somehow sick make them all. And yet: We live in a structure of the diseases, every room, every time, every subject is determined in relation to the disease. A life without diseases is not conceivable, and who wants to prevent the one type of illness at any cost, makes itself more receptive for the other. The disease is anthropological constant and historical variable. Of course, it is a significant part of civilization history: to fight diseases. Or even: \"eradic\" diseases. Unfortunately, not only diseases disappear, new ones are added. The same civilization, the diseases, after all, to \"control\" is capable of \" \nDiseases emerged. A disease is all the more civilized, the more she can tell. Normal social communication is not limited to telling each other from diseases, creating at least one rhetoric of condolding (completely with a truth of indifference and hypocrisy). Undoubtedly, the handling of the disease is a reflex of political-economic basic settings. There is a lot possible between \"self guilt\" and active help. If we do not tell war and love, then we tell of illness. It is the triangle of what the people are still indispensable to \"nature\": the sexuality, the aggressiveness and the disease. Disease As crisis of life, in any case leads to a crisis of social reality. She is also the fact and truth. Thus, we are currently not frightening before the disease and not just before their dissemination, but also from a publicity of the malignancy in society, stone experiments there, Hassmails against the relatives of those affected here, racist failures here, V\u00f6lkian mood against open limits. And unpleasant shifts in everyday life, the back of each who coughs, the \"hamster purchase\" in the supermarket, the hysterization of news and discussions about the \"Corona\" scream of the woman in the supermarket, in the face of an Asian woman. Contagious diseases, we start with the more or less harmless \"cold,\" naturally collect the narrative while simultaneously restricting direct social contact. Expected is expected from the patient to consider the healthy. Protective measures of the healthy, measures are expected of the authorities and authorities, of social subsystems. The company must be protected from the disease, and in this case also: in front of the sick. At the same time, the contact must not really cancel. May real people in quarantine and isolation are held, while at the same time, there is a minimum of social life, communication and trust. Now it gets complicated. The contagious ill man deserves the usual degree of compassion, but is also a danger. Therefore, the response to the immoral, unreasonable and actual disease becomes a direct issue of morality and reason. A person with an infectious disease can behave immoral and unreasonable. But it can be assumed at the same time that he behaves immoral and unreasonable. And in the barbaric collected into civilization history, the sick person himself becomes immoral and unreasonable enough to banish him, condemn and finally destroy it. A society defines itself not least by handling illness and sick. In the narrative of the disease \nIf the actual as the mirror image is not only canceled, but also displaced. Directly or indirectly all contagious diseases associated with living nature are associated with, biblically speaking, \"explosive\" that cause the disease, transfer them or produce them. The narrative of infectious diseases is at the core a mixing of animal and human, sexual or culinary taboo violation to content. Patient X, the first in which the disease broke out, is actually never found, but medical and mythical reconstructed. He is a protagonist of a surness, a violation of divine, natural and cultural orders. He has touched something or was touched by something, which opened the gate of omnipresent terror of nature to the field of human facts. Every illness has a mythical and perhaps religious transcendence. Not only because the disease is the presence of death in life, but also because it demands after the explanation in the other side that is not to have in the world of the facts. Disease must be exam and punishment, otherwise she does not make sense. It would be still better, the gods would have sent the disease than that they would be indifferent to her or even helpless. In the end, the story tells - after the overcoming / renewal / habituation of the disease - from a general debt. Guilt on the plague were a lack of hygiene, blame for AIDS Hedonism and sexual Libertino. What will be guilty at the coronavirus if it has become \"defeated\" or even to the cyclically occurring normal case? A disease is \"defeated\" if it was either eradicated (so that a new chapter of civilization history can be started) or if it has become part of the life stories as the world history. What is a virus? Maybe at the same time a pre- and an antiform of life. It lacks the two presents of life, metabolism and subjective replication, ie the independent reproduction of a DNA. One can therefore see a virus neither as a \"creature\" nor as a dead thing. It is something between existence and information that does not occur in any creation story and, in all scientific research and a large number of findings, ultimately remains a mystery. The development of the living things seems to have been associated with the production of specific viruses. Viruses were also detected in the remains of dinosaurs. What role viruses played when the extinction of these animals, which may have been in the main victim of a climate catastrophe? The connection of the two metaphors may result in an apocalyptic image of the natural history: the creation has apparently ever experienced a radical break and a new beginning. Why should not it happen again? not just the single person, not just a \"kingdom\" or one \n\"Culture\", even humanity itself is not immortal. or? Many living things are known that they serve special viruses as hosts; If a balance should be set here sooner or later, the greatest risk is apparently in the more or less sudden change in viruses and overpraying from a species to another. As far as the endangerment of man is concerned, one speaks of \"zoonotic\", a virus - as probably the current coronavirus - circulates in animals and then jumps, mutating or mutated, on humans over. A bat is suspected of standing at Covid-19 infection chain (about who knows how many intermediaries to humans), and now this: the first dog in which the virus was detected. The history of the viruses, however, is not synchronous for the evolutionary history of the living beings; The sudden is obviously as own as eternity. Therefore, they accompany this story apocalyptic: Since the people have a little bit of what viruses are and how they work (starting at the end of the 19th century with the proof that there is some disease, which is significantly smaller than a bacterium, which is significantly smaller than a bacterium) They the viral assassination of individual species, the ominous transformation (the zombie virus) or a threatening destruction of the living things (viruses from the as well as the introduced diseases of dark colonialism) into their popular mythologies. Viruses exist beyond the dimensionality of life in time, space and subject. So they wear negative transcendence into the realm of the facts. Since viruses can not live independently, they can not have been created after life, as it were, as it were as a mass-defect of life itself: genes that dissolved from their original function, lonely particles in search of their original cohesion, whose loss they are Teaching and destructive signals turned. What a grandiose anti-acting history: from the evolutionary orders Fallen information particles of the living beings lead an everlasting war against their origins. So what is a virus? the devil may be. Flu, rabies, herpes, smallpox, hepatitis, dengue fever, Ebola, AIDS, measles - there are always new approaches to how viruses suffer their hosts, discover, kill. Are viruses so (in pure innocence) absolutely evil? Since there are both \"allies\" as well as \"enemies\" among the viruses, viruses are also used for disease control, for example in the form of \"oncolytic viruses\" in tumor control and, of course, immunization (\"vaccination\"). So you can say: As long as there are viruses, man is not sure and nothing of what he can achieve - is not true, Mr. Everyone? But it is also his story to survive in a viral world. Finally, he created a separate viral communication system in \nThe all sorts of \"computer viruses\" are about. Again, it's about cleaved information particles that are looking for hosts and spread with their help. Again, there are \"deadly\" mutations, defense mechanisms, skipping events. Apparently, the history of the viruses continues in the second creation, in the machines, in the simulations, artificial life, in the posthumous lifting. If one day there would be the \"world on the wire\", which we imagine in novels and films, then would probably be threatened with the simulacron of man of artificial viruses. One could argue in a seizure of the epistemologist: Human thinking has some virus-shaped itself. Or otherwise: The virus has long since made the leap from nature into culture. Such a digression may be very helpful in view of the drastic viral actuality, where thorough hand washing and proper armbouse-sneezing seems much more useful as a smart-bugged mind game. But it is not that easy: it is not necessary to understand the viral principle as a shadow of life and history. Among other things, to fight something, what makes some worse than the risk of infection itself. Namely the fear of her. You like to tell us a lot about the relativity of dangers through the Coronavirus, about the \"normality\" of flu victims and traffic totes, about suitable countermeasures and healing prospects. But this disease is new. It is uncertain how they will develop, and uncertain is also how life has to change, so that one learns to live with this disease and accepts their victims as \"normal\". After all, an insidious selection is distinguished; The old and weak, the \"pre-patients\" people are the main deaths candidates, possibly also people who infect multiple times, such as physicians and nursing staff, \"service providers\" and order forces. No less insidiously the greatest dangers: the journey, the public assembly, the cultural life. And last but not least (it seems that in certain circles just this the main reason for panic) are economic growth and stock market prices in danger. In China, it means that the coronavirus is due to the economic decline a significant improvement in air quality; The wealth \"flees to gold\", the archaic and unproductive form of capital. In short: the coronavirus as a metaphorical punishment for globalization of capitalism actually leads to a regression (possibly here and there also to a recession); The biographical selection follows a political-economic. Disease can be metaphors, symptoms, accelerators of fundamental shifts of power and orders; Playing, certainly, as well as in the case of world riches an important role as vice versa in colonization and exploitation; In the big wars, diseases were often so \nDecisive such as army strengthens, weather, strategies and armaments, in the worst case, diseases are deliberately used as weapons - and conversely, propaganda quickly assumes the disease of the enemy to be insidious. At the moment, it is already researched, such as the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, which best deals with countries, societies, regions, government forms, religions and regimes with the Coronavirus and which will have greater difficulties. Unnecessary to say: According to these investigations, the so-called rogue states are most suffering and the so-called Western democracies are best. Almost means the clammy joy that the rise of countries such as China or Iran is stopped by the epidemics, while ... we cover the coat of humanistic reason about a recent narrative, in which it all comes together: the Penuche as a punishment of God (to the regimes of \"unbelievers\" and unobstructed and the cosmopolitan wandering and the \"messy\"), the disease as a punishment for the openness of the boundaries (and the betrayal on the construction of V\u00f6lkischer and national identities as an image of a \" healthy \"and\" defensive \"body) and the disease as a competitive advantage in economic war, as a punishment and reward for civilizational efficiency. This narrative of triple malice is hardly present in a pure and compact form. There are rather suggestive pictures. Incidentally, the study of said university in Baltimore also distributes a disease prevention rating for Europe, whose result is strangely synchronous with certain political preferences: US and Great Britain Super, Germany rather poorly as right. We only live with the disease or against them, but also in the fear of her. The fear of the disease will turn even to the disease. But even the famous \"imaged ill\" is a quite ambivalent character. On the one hand, he expresses his fear of the disease (and of course the importance of his endangered person), but on the other hand, he also formulates a request for appeal, indulgence and comfort. As far as the biographies is concerned, we are completely clear to us that there is also a \"escape into the disease\", the disease as a metaphor of a general overburdening and unresolved contradictions. Better be sick as guilty, prefer to give the own body as the peering fellow human beings. Can there be a society that flees into the disease? In a small coin, we experience the daily media consumption as an infinite screw of disease fear and precise promise; Health may be a fetish at the end, which is a fear of the constant fear, not fit enough for the competition and for the subsequent fun. Health is a commodity and the highest good of self-marketing. no \nSo wonders that one of the symptoms of the virus crisis is increasing the business with the fear, usury prices and the miracle healer. Even the fear of the disease is at the same time a physical and a social. How will you treat me if I'm sick? Will I even be able to afford more help, I will \"be buried\" to others, I will remember the sick, the right of self-determination, the fear of the disease is transformed into the fear of me, the sick? And vice versa, the social systems are wondering: How to deal with the sick, however with the fears? What needs to be banned which rights must not be touched or only in the greatest emergency? How much truth, how much lie must be disseminated in the interest of public peace and order? How to ensure the supply, accommodation, treatment without producing crises elsewhere? In fact, each disease is also a sample to the relationship between governments and the ruled. In gloomy times, epidemics and civil wars are interwoven into each other. A disease, we have claimed at the beginning, is an immoral, unreasonable and unesthetic fact. It is the scandalous recurrence of nature. In order to live with her as a society and culture, the disease must be moralized, rationalized and aesthetized. But just because this never succeeds completely, there are also the evasive, the myths, the conspiracy fantasies, the ideologies. Finally, illness as a metaphor has always been used in both directions: the disease expresses a conflict, the conflict can be described as a disease. Are we currently not, among other things, affected by the illness of legal populistic hate production? The fact that the AFD or the \"identity\" lightning rash back to its nationalist and racist foundations and demand \"incourse stops\" and \"border closures\" is more than expected: \"Open borders also mean open boundaries for viruses\" says it, and Alice Weidel warns : \"It would be more than negligent if necessary due to unilateral fixation on the dogma of open borders necessary measures to curb the virus or too late.\" That sounds more harmless than it is. On the one hand, the danger is raised (everything that can be scared is incorporated by the extreme right to the own world of utilization), so as just to shake trust between the ruling and ruling (the virus count as the continuation of the \"migrants\" counting). On the other hand, however, it is built indirectly again on the equation of foreign and dangerous. Of course, the Coronavirus is the \"Wuhan virus\" for the AFD; As a result, people with \"Asian trains\" have to resist a general suspicion. And then it goes on again: \"If the coronavirus is so harmless - why are the Russians border their limits?\" And, \"plays the German \nGovernment with our lives? \"DR. Malte Kaufmann from the AFD adds his great advice (\" keeping away \",\" investing inventories \") the peculiar saying:\" We stand by it together. \"And further placates the AFD:\" Corona is coming : Germany does not act! \"The transparent panic tactics of the right-wing extremists are opposed to elsewhere, as well as in the USA by Donald Trump, negligent appeasures and deniers. The Iranian government finally reaches the oldest trick and assumes\" conspiracy from abroad \", blame for the panic if not at the virus itself. But rightly such an association no longer wants to work. It is finally the actuality of the disease that she deprives to a degree of ideologization. The three social consequences of viral disease, the treacherous selection (and try to benefit to it), cultural, social and economic paralysis as well as mythization, propagandaization And ideological, impulses are opposite (\"culture instead of scary\" is about a brave defroyle in Italy). And there is also an increased feeling for the paralysis for what is always growing, according to Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin, where the danger is greatest: the saving. The escalator, which is not alone in a capability, to \"control\" the disease, but also in a reflection on the virtues of the human sense. It is undoubtedly \"dark times\" in which a disease can not help but serve as a metaphor. In front of us the comprehensive ecological catastrophe, in our organizations of decaying orders and the rise of despotic and terrorist groups, the application to healing directions, cults and charlatans as well as in the middle of in the middle - as if you had conspired, Edgar Allan Poes the mask of red death as a mass spectacle. The myth of the \"darkness\" requires the great disease as well as those climatic and political disasters leading to harvesting failures, expulsions, famine and migration pressure. But as it goes with crises so when the coronavirus can be prevented from becoming a great disease (or if it might not have the stuff from the outset), then the other symptoms of a dark time may be treated, The dark time itself may be faced. The virus is probably completely no matter. It's nothing but a fact. ", "label": 1}, {"content": "Coronavirus: Calvelex suspends production for lack of raw material and orders.

The new coronavirus - which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan and has killed 304 people - motivated the World Health Organization (WHO) to decree international health emergence. The number of infected cases increases every day and has already spread across several countries in Europe. In Portugal, the first two suspicions did not confirm but the alert is global and the general panic.\r\nWorld Health Authorities have alerted citizens to take action in order to avoid spreading the virus, whose propagation speed is still unknown. The use of masks is one of them, especially in China, where the use of them was already daily due to high pollution indiffers.\n\r\nHowever, excessive demand from coronavirus has led to the stock of masks to run away, a little all over the world. This situation has led that some people 'improvise' by using unlikely objects such as bras, plastic bags, containers and even leaves of lettuce and orange peels to cover the respiratory tract. But is this a good idea?\nCan the mask protect from the virus? According to the Daily Mail, there are three types of mask available in the market.\r\nThe first are the reusable cloth, which have become a fashion icon in Asia, sold with the most diverse colors and patterns.\r\nThere is also the so-called 'surgical mask', known for being used by doctors and nurses at the operating table. It is made of paper and other fibers and is light and thin. They are not reusable, so they should be thrown out after first use.\r\nFinally, there are more resistant masks, used by health professionals in hospitals where there are outbreaks or infections, and also by construction workers in the works, to protect themselves from the dust and undesirable materials.\r\nBut which of these three will be the best solution to protect us from coronavirus? Studies argue that the answer is not watertight, and that may vary depending on the form of spreading of the virus, which in the case of the Chinese deadly virus, is still unknown.\r\nThis is because some viruses propagate through the 'droplets' of saliva and mucus. If any infected person coughing or sneezing, the virus is driven and does not float in the air. These 'droplets' can be inhaled directly, or, most of the time, stay in our hands when we touch some contaminated surface, which when in contact with the mouth, nose or eyes, can convey the infection.\r\nOther types of viruses pass through the air and exist in small particles of moisture, ending to propagate more easily. In these cases, there is no scientific evidence that masks can help protection, since the air transported particles can penetrate the entries of it and reach the mouth and nose.\r\n\"The effectiveness of surgical masks against air transmitted infections is low because they do not provide a seal around the face and do not have a good filtering,\" said Raina MacIntyre researcher from the University of New South Wales in Australia.\nMasks that should be avoided at all the cost masks of cloth, popular in China, as well as any other improvisation through fabric, may come to provoke even more damage to health, in addition to revealing in\u00edtiles at the level of protection. This is because if they are not washed correctly, they can accumulate waste or even infected particles, proliferating the viralization.\r\nResearch conducted by Australian scientists reveal that utilizing whatever the object or material other than the traditional mask is just a waste of time. Conversely, they advise the use of reusable masks used by doctors and nurses. The tight and close fit to the face is essential to prevent the entry of infected particles.\nWashing hands is the best OMS defense advises the use of disposal gloves in public and regular washing of the hands with soap or disinfectant. Avoid touching knobs and other public surfaces as well as departing from sick and coughing people and avoiding towel sharing are other measures that must be adopted defensively.

it is mainly in the upper-respiratory fact. blood testing is not required for healthy people as of now. dr guleria: neither sipping hot water nor consumption of alcohol will kill the virus. alcohol-based sanitizers kill the virus on your hands but once in your throat, the virus infects the cells and alcohol cannot help there. dr guleria: if you can use soap with water, it is a better thing. one uses soap more thoroughly and it helps clear the virus in between the fingers and under the nails. if you do not have soap, use hand sanitizer but clean your hands thoroughly and regularly. dr guleria: one of the ways the novel coronavirus spreads is through droplet infection. droplet means that it is in the air for some time and people who come in close contact with someone who has the infection get infected. but these droplets also settle on surfaces and touching these surfaces can lead to infection. if someone infected with novel coronavirus touches a doorknob with his hands, the infection will settle on the doorknob for a few hours and it is a good idea to clean it. dr guleria: depends on the surface. some data suggests that it can survive on cardboard for a few hours or other surfaces which are metal-based and especially if the \ntemperature is low and the humidity is high, it may even survive 6-8 hours. that is why it is important to regularly wash hours. dr guleria: if you touch the cough droplet on your clothes with your hands and then touch your face, it can lead to infection. touching one's face should be avoided. the cough droplet cannot reach one's respiratory tract by itself. dr guleria: there is no evidence right now. eating well-cooked non-vegetarian food outside or at home poses no risk of coronavirus. dr guleria: there is no data suggesting that like swine flu, pregnant woman are at a higher risk. pregnant women should avoid crowded areas. dr guleria: one should avoid non-essential travel. if you are travelling, regular hand washing is important. dr guleria: whatever data we have from china suggests that some groups are at a higher risk. these include elderly; those above the age of 60 have more severe infection. people with co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, chronic heart or respiratory diseases are also at a higher risk and need to be extra careful. dr guleria: global trends suggest that the infection is still on the rise and has not reached a plateau. the number of cases is rising all over the world. there will be rise over the next few weeks until that plateau is reached and then we will see a downward trend as can be seen in china and south korea. dr guleria: there is no data to suggest this. dr guleria: smoking does decrease the respiratory defence mechanism and therefore, the recovery does slow down. i would advise people to either decrease or quit smoking. dr guleria: we are in a better place but it is not over now and we need to be vigilant. the next few weeks are very crucial because we may see a sudden spike in the number of cases.

And, anyway, these patients who have a second positive test are a minority: monitoring made to these patients showed that between 80% and 90% had no trace of coronavirus in the blood a month after receiving hospital discharge. \"These samples are small and are not sufficient to confirm the validity of our initial thesis,\" Wang concluded. \"We need a large-scale epidemiological study to determine what should be the guidance of disease monitoring and prevention work.\" Outside the Tongji hospital, there were also other reports of patients recovered with a second positive test. According to Life Times, quoted by South China Morning Post in Wuhan, the percentage of recovered patients that return positive in the tests is between 5% and 10% - a percentage higher than the hospital numbers. Life Times gave a family of three people who went back to infecting after recovering; The North American newspaper Los Angeles Times published a report on the subject and realized at least 100 reports of Chinese patients who returned to a positive test for the new coronavirus. The absence of a large-scale study confirming these conclusions underlines the \nImportance of continuing to monitor these patients, even after they are discharged. And Chinese experts underlay: it is imperative that even after high, they remain in isolation for at least 14 days so that they can be tested again to confirm the verdict. Tong Chaohui, expert in respiratory diseases of the central government working group of Hubei Province, whose capital is Wuhan, confirms the importance of continuing to monitor these patients, although so far \"no family member closest to these recovered patients a positive test \". These patients also do not have \"traces of coronavirus in the samples of laboratory culture,\" Tong revealed. \"Although nucleic acid tests have been positive, we make random checks suggest that patients have developed efficient antibodies in the protection against the nucleic acid of the virus.\" Who has a positive test and has no symptoms is sent to one of the Wuhan quarantine buildings, said Tu Yuanchao, Deputy Director of the Health Committee of Hubei Province, interviewed by the local newspaper of Hubei. Already who presented symptoms after the second positive test returned to the hospital. China currently has more patients recovered than new cases confirmed from the new coronavirus. In mainland China, almost 90% of patients have already been discharged, but there are still 4300 people receiving hospital treatment. Since the beginning of the outbreak, China reported more than 81,000 cases and 3200 deaths. However, there is something to worry about Chinese sanitary authorities: the import of cases. In fact, there are cases of infection in the country, but were all identified in people who have recently reached China, from countries hit by Covid-19.

One of the questions that concern researchers from around the world is to perceive for sure if these recovered patients can continue to infect other people. It is that, despite the clues in Wuhan, it is important to realize for sure if this happens or not. On the other hand, it is vital to know if patients create antibodies that protect them against the disease and if they acquire immunity. In Portugal, diagnostic kits have already been created so that the country does not have to import them. At least one of them has already been certified by the National Institute of Health Dr. Ricardo Jorge (Insa), the reference laboratory in the country for the tests, and is now in the final hits of validation of the results.

The coronavirus pandemic \"is accelerating\": the alert is from the World Health Organization (WHO) and was given this Monday for its Director General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebrueyesus. \"It took 67 days since the first case reported to reach 100,000 cases, 11 days for seconds 100,000, and only four days for the third 100,000, synthesized. \"We need unity among G20 countries that hold more than 80% of global GDP. If we do not give priority to the protection of health workers, many people will die because the health professional that could save them the lives are sick, \"said the person in charge. This on the day the number of infected surpassed the 370 thousand, the deaths exceeded 16 thousand and those recovered the 100,000. Italy, with more than 63 thousand cases, is close to the number of cases of China (81 thousand), and the deaths in Italian territory (more than six thousand) are almost double those registered in Chinese territory (more than three thousand). Beijing authorities advanced that the country continues without local cases of infection, while those in Rome closed non-essential production throughout the country. With more than 35,000 cases of infection and more than two thousand dead, perceive here as Spain entered the same path of Italy. One more given that can help explain: elderly in Spanish homes live in the same space as corpses that are not removed from the rooms. The country renewed the alarm state for another two weeks. Still in Spain, actress Luc\u00eda Bos\u00e9 died, at the age of 89, in a Hospital de Segovia. Another mortal victim of the pandemic in that country was former deputy Jos\u00e9 Loose, who was Secretary of State for Energy in the governments of Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar and president of the Electric Network. The ambassador of Portugal in Spain left an alert, asking the Portuguese to avoid traveling and staying at home. In France, the National Health Agency announced that three doctors died after contracting Coronavirus. Also the European Parliament communicated the first death by Covid-19, and to offer psychological support to its employees. Panama's authorities confirmed the death of a 13-year-old girl, one of the younger victims in the pandemic. Numbers registered at global level indicate that Covid-19 is more dangerous in patients who are already suffering from health problems and among the older population. However, the death of the adolescent in that country comes to give more strength to alerts that have been launched by the experts: young adults and children are not immune to the risk of contagion and suffer serious consequences. The US President Donald Trump, exhorted his fellow citizens to keep himself together. \"I want Americans to know that we will overcome this challenge. Normal life will return, \"he said. Although it continuously referred to coronavirus as a \"Chinese virus\", Trump \nIt stated that Americans of Asian origin should not be held accountable. Trump assured that he will not let \"healing is worse than the problem itself.\" \"This is a medical problem. We will not let coronavirus become a long-term financial problem, \"he added. The US health authorities have registered more than a hundred dead one in a single day, which raises the number of deaths to 545 throughout the country. The former cinema producer Harvey Weinstein, arrested for violation and sexual abuse, is infected with coronavirus. The information arrived from the Penitentiary Authorities of the State of New York, where he fulfills a penalty of 23 years in prison. In the UK, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, indicated that there are only five reasons for leaving home: buy food, exercise once a day, go to the doctor or pharmacy, go to work (but only if it is not possible to work from home) and help vulnerable people.

German Chancellor has been quarantined since Sunday, after a doctor with whom she had been positive for the virus. However, the siege is tightened to Merkel so that he lies off the coronabonds taboo. A brief memory exercise: In 2012, at the height of the sovereign debt crisis, Chancellor assured that only from her corpse there would be European bonds that would allow Euro zone debt to mutualize. Now, she will probably have to find a coronabond, whatever it is. Finance Ministers of the 27 Member States of the European Union (EU) have given their assessment to the suspension of budgetary discipline, validating the European Commission proposal releasing governments from the recommended goals of the deficit. The goal is to increase your margin of maneuver so that they can inject more money into the combat to the pandemic. Brussels made known that he wants green roads on borders for freight transport. And the EU was still prepared to assist Venezuela financially and Iran, \"which are in greater difficulties due to sanctions.\" Despite the change of commission strategy, European scholarships opened this Monday in red. And the technological also trembled: although they are one of the most dynamic sectors around the world and the most trained for telecommuting, these characteristics do not make them immune to the impacts of the pandemic. In the USA, the Federal Reserve will make purchases without limit. According to an advanced balance sheet by the France-Presse Agency, more than a billion people in more than 50 countries or territories are confined in their homes in order of their authorities. But WHO warns that the \nConfinement may not arrive to defeat the virus. In the African continent, the most affected country, South Africa, announced that its citizens will be in isolation from Thursday. In Ethiopia, the strategy goes by closing the terrestrial boundaries. Also in India there are tightest containment measures and internal flights are suspended. In Brazil, Rio de Janeiro is quarantined and only supermarkets and pharmacies are open to open doors. The day was also marked by the unknown regarding the Tokyo Olympics. Canada began to ensure that if the Olympics are held this year, the country will not send its athletes to Tokyo. The Japanese prime minister stated that \"the annulment is not a possibility,\" but acknowledged that the postponement of the competition \"can be inevitable.\" In an interview with the newspaper \"USA Today\", Dick Pound, the most veteran of the members of the International Olympic Committee, said the decision to postpone the games \"is taken\".

Berlin (DPA / TMN) - How strong does the Coronavirus SARS-COV-2 affect tourism? And can I still fly in the face of the climate crisis? These are two questions that are likely to be hotly discussed hot this year at the Rice Fair ITB in Berlin (4 to 8 March). The Klimathema is a permanent burner for industry and travelers - and the virus a new crisis. Fear of Corona - but still little impact of what the local problem of a Chinese province worked, has become an international danger: more and more people suffer from Covid-19, the disease that triggers the coronavirus, especially in China Even. Flights to the Middle Middle were painted, cruise ships set in Asia. \"China is not a major travel destination from a German point of view,\" says tourism researchers Prof. Torsten cherry. But the virus could also have significant negative effects for the surrounding countries in Asia. \"An entire region could be under general suspicion,\" the expert estimates from the Jade University in Wilhelmshaven. Concerns lead to booking retention First signs there are: Several German tour operators offer guests the option to cancel or rebook for free until a few weeks before the trip to an Asian country - for example, to Thailand or Vietnam - for free. This speaks that vacationers start to avoid the region. The novel coronavirus take a part of his carefree to travel, says Kirstges. And the ITB itself? There are also Chinese exhibitors expected, two have been canceled so far. \"We are prepared, but not hysterical,\" says David Ruetz, head of ITB. The Corona crisis also has an impact in this country: according to the German headquarters for tourism, various cities and sights a partially clear decline of Chinese visitors are distinguished. Travel and climate: Good intentions instead of real renunciation should we make less vacation in the face of the climate crisis? Or at least less fly? The ITB has set the topic of sustainability back to the agenda. \"You can not make travel under general suspicion,\" says Ruetz. Positive effects often fell under the table, such as the economic benefits for the traveling countries. The ITB is a platform for a fair discussion. And what do the tourists think themselves? The topic is quite discussed. But almost no one actually changes his behavior. Prof. Kirstges brings the attitude of the vacationers to the point: \"Wash the fur, but do not wet me.\" The guest wants the impression that the organizer or the hotel takes care of sustainability. He does not want to do without himself. Flying is harmful - anyway, all \"all statistics show that travel behavior will not be significantly influenced, let alone the people from flying chame no longer travel,\" explains \nKirstes. The arrival with the aircraft is particularly harmful to the climate. But tourists can rely on their provider really sustainable? \"The industry is sensitive, but the most provider does not voluntarily do nothing,\" says Kirstges. \"Nobody scares off customers without compulsion and renounced sales.\" After the Brexit is before Brexit after a long godrere it happened: Britain has left the EU on January 31st. For travelers, however, does not change anything: until the end of the year, a transitional phase applies. Flights go as planned, you will continue with a personnel pass to England. Therefore, Brexit should not be a big topic on the ITB. Unclear is so far, however, as it continues after 2020, for example in terms of flights from, to and across the UK. The German Travel Association holds a comprehensive aviation agreement for necessary. So you can still book a flight over London, for example, to the USA for 2021? \"Yes, probably no problem,\" says Kirstges. \"There is certainly a solution to be found.\" Luxury trips and digitization Both topics are not new, but playing a major role on the ITB: the segment of luxury travel and digitization. \"Luxury trips worldwide make up 14 percent of tourism sales,\" says ITB Head of David Ruetz. There is a change \"towards the intangible luxury, the experience, even spiritual\". So less bling-bling, but exclusive sense search. A question of the fair will be: how do luxury and sustainability fit together? In addition, the tourism industry discusses how it can become more digital. There will be juggled with keywords such as blockchain or artificial intelligence (ki). Kirstges points to the fact that many organizers do not even make it shortage, ordinary newsletters. \"Every year, digital high-tech seeds are driven through the tourist village, but they usually run back quickly.\" Information for visitors of the travel exhibition ITB The ITB in Berlin is the largest and most important travel fair in the world. This year, from 4 to 8 March, around 10,000 exhibitors from more than 180 countries are expected in the exhibition halls around the radio tower. Trade visitors discuss important topics of the tourism industry from Wednesday to Friday. Private visitors are invited to explore halls and exhibitors on Saturday and Sunday. Partner country this year is the Sultanate Oman. The day ticket costs 13 euros in the online shop, there are 16 euros on site. Discounts there are no entries for students, children under 14 years. The fair is open for private individuals from 10:00 to 18:00. Waiting times during the inlet plan. Last year, the fair counted around 160,000 visitors. The exhibition halls can be reached by the S-Bahn, via the stations Messe Nord / ICC and Messe S\u00fcd. Also with the red subway line 2 (station Theodor-Heuss Square) the journey is possible. \nThere are also firmly furnished shuttle bus lines.

", "label": 1}, {"content": "coronavirus pandemic and mental health: how we can help people in quarantine. qurantine: our best bet to fight covid-19 there are basically two ways in which this can be achieved--quarantine and isolation. though often used interchangeably in media reports, these terms refer to unique situations. quarantine is the separation of people who are suspected of having being exposed to the infection, while isolation refers to separation of the infected person(s) (i.e. confirmed cases) from the general population. similarly, hundreds of indian nationals who were evacuated from china following the coronavirus outbreak too were put in special quarantine facilities set up in new delhi. in china, many affected cities have been turned into quarantines to contain the spread of coronavirus outbreak. with 26 new covid-19 cases, health officials in delhi, rajasthan and uttar pradesh are working on a war-footing to trace all people who are likely to have come in contact with these confirmed cases. once they are traced, they will be placed under quarantine for at least 14 days. the infected patients have meanwhile been put in isolation for recovery and to contain further spread of the viral infection. need a sensitive touch while putting people in quarantine has proved to be effective in controlling epidemics triggered by communicable diseases, it is important that the process is sensitive enough to ensure that those who are being put in quarantines don't suffer mental agony. it is important for health officials and society to ensure that people put in quarantine and isolation aren't stigmatised or made to feel that they are being treated like criminals. \"when individuals are viewed as potential threats to public health, they may feel unfairly attacked and stigmatised,\" mariner writes. for this, the researchers reviewed 24 studies that were conducted in 10 countries to understand the psychological effects among people put in quarantine during epidemics like ebola, sars, h1n1 influenza pandemic, mers and equine influenza. (sars and mers are two other known forms of coronavirus-related viral infections.) the study notes that quarantine is often an \"unpleasant experience\" for those who undergo the medical process. it says this separation from loved ones, along with fear and anxiety of uncertainty over status of the disease (i.e. whether the person is infected or not) can create \"dramatic\" psychological effects, including suicide. who's mythbuster on coronavirus quarantine: the impact it can have on mental health a 2008 study on people quarantined for suspected exposure to sars showed that about 20 per cent (230 of 1,057 participants) reported fear, 18 per cent each reported nervousness and sadness, and 10 per cent reported having guilt. in another study, researchers found that some people who were put on quarantine showed signs of stress and depression even after three years, and that about 9 per cent of the quarantined people showed \"high depressive symptoms\". thus, \nwhile all people put in quarantine may not necessarily report these signs, it is likely that some may. what can cause stress in quarantine in technical terms, factors that cause stress of any nature are called stressors. when we talk about people who are put in quarantine during an epidemic, these stressors can be of varying nature. people who are put in quarantine can develop fear that they may end up contracting the infection/disease. the uncertainty of the status of disease is another factor that adds to this fear. example: quarantined parents may become fearful that they may have infected their children. this fear in turn has the potential of developing into guilt among the quarantined. it can get heightened when people in quarantine show any symptom related to the infection, even though they may actually not be infected. quarantine is also a period when a person can't carry out his/her daily routine due to the restriction in movement. in some cases, this can result in boredom, while in others it may be trigger stress over possible financial loss on account of inability to work. daily wagers (labourers, street vendors, rickshaw pullers etc) become the most vulnerable to this financial stress if they are quarantined for a long period. in case of coronavirus, the quarantine period is 14 days, which would mean no earning for this entire period. this puts considerable mental and financial stress not only on the quarantined person, but also on his/her family members. while the above stressors are likely to subsume in the days following the end of the quarantine period, what also causes mental agony is the stigma that society attaches with any infectious diseases, especially ones that become epidemic and require people to be separated from general population. india and many other developing societies have battled against such stigma in cases related to tuberculosis (tb), leprosy and even aids. patients of tb carried the stigma for rest of their lives. those of leprosy faced the worst. they were ostracised and left to die in ignonymity. aids patients continue to face similar discrimination. governments have spent crores of rupees but change in societal attitude has been slow. in fact, three of the quarantined healthcare workers reported that they were unable to resume work because their \"employers expressed fear of contagion\". similarly, a 2015 study on people quarantined for ebola epidemic in liberia suggested that the stigma could \"lead to disenfranchisement of minority groups\", making them more vulnerable to discrimination and ostracization. quarantine is needed: this is how we all can help this doesn't mean nothing can be done to mitigate these adverse effects of quarantine. the government, family members, the media and society in general can play important roles in making people's stay in quarantine/isolation stress free. the following are some interventions that we can make: for the unorganised sector, the government must announce emergency \nmeasures to win people's confidence that their daily wages during the quarantine period will be taken care of by it. the government can consider paying quarantined daily wagers the wage promised under the mgnrega. such measures would diminish the chances of people from socially and economically marginalised sections hiding their illness. economically vulnerable people tend to live in clusters where personal hygiene is not given priority. these clusters of habitations have been found to be more susceptible to a contagion outbreak. meanwhile, employers in the organised sector need to assure their employees that the quarantine (or isolation) period on account of coronavirus will not affect their salary. a failure on part of the government and the employers on this count has the potential to result in a situation where people who are infected or those who have been exposed to the infection would not report themselves to medical facilities owing to the fear of loss of income. if this happens, it will prove to be catastrophic.

But that will change abruptly when an employee of a local car supplier is detected the new coronavirus. It is the first case in Germany. Just a few hours later, in front of the headquarters of Webasto in the 4000-inhabitant district Stockdorf Camerateams, in the local pharmacies, there is a run on Tuesday on mask masks and disinfectants. Already on Tuesday evening, three more cases are known in connection with the first. These are also webasto employees and worked like around 1000 others in the headquarters from the district of Starnberg, in which the first person concerned is employed, report a spokesman for the Bavarian Ministry of Health in Munich and the company on Tuesday evening. \"It was decided that the three new patients in Munich clinic Schwabing was stationary and was medically supervised and isolated there,\" the Ministry continues told. \"For some other contact persons, there is currently a test if there is also an infection with the coronavirus here, too.\" Further information should follow on Wednesday. Webasto temporarily closes the location Stockdorf to Sunday. The first confirmed cases in Germany leave the responsible rods. \"Our night was relatively short,\" says the President of the Bavarian State Office for Health and Food Safety (LGL), Andreas Zapf, on Tuesday. At 8.30 pm on Monday evening he will be informed that the Bayer has been positively tested for the coronavirus. Since then, the wires glow. Shortly before midnight, the Bavarian Ministry of Health informs the public, a few hours later, the foyer of the Ministry bursts all seams. At the press conference, those skilled in the press, the virus took the preliminary name 2019-NCOV on his way to Germany: On January 16, a Chinese employee of the company Webasto visit from their parents from their parents from their parents from the new coronavirus in Shanghai. Affected region Wuhan. Three days later, she is on the way to the headquarters of her company in Germany. On January 21, she takes part in a training there, in the Gautinger district Stockdorf. According to the information, it was still good. Only on her return flight to China on January 23, the woman feels flu, home to the doctor - and is positively tested for the coronavirus. On Monday, January 27, the company management in Germany learns from the finding. It is rapidly and informs the colleagues. An employee who participated in the training together with the woman and worked together in a small group can be tested. He had been \"grippy felt, rather in the sense of a \nHeavy bronchitis \". And indeed: The test is positive. The family father comes immediately to the Klinikum Schwabing, is meticulously monitored there in an insulating room with lock and negative pressure from the doctors - he is now fit. A \"healthy\" on the insulating station - this unusual situation lets the treating chief physician Clemens Wendtner jokes: \"He is awake, responsive and I would also dare the statement that he is except mortal danger.\" The patient has neither fever nor coughing, it goes He \"very good\". Nevertheless, the man must remain at first indefinite time on the insulating station. \"We can not say certainly how long the virus is transmitted from the sick if he is healthy,\" explains Zapf. The virus is still so new that the physicians do not know so many things. Relatively rarely, such a transfer is also: worldwide, only three more cases known in which a person outside China has infected at another - this happened in Japan, Vietnam and Taiwan. Most people also had symptoms as they infected others. In the course of the day further suspected cases are reported in Germany. While the laboratories in the other federal states still examine the samples, the authorities are focused on around 40 people in the free state with which the German patient and the Chinese had narrower contact. These are not only colleagues, but also the man's family - they should stay home during the incubation time of up to 14 days. In view, those responsible also have a nursery in the district of Landsberg am Lech, who visited the small child of the patient. \"We do not see any reason to close the crib,\" emphasizes a spokesman for Landratum. \"Neither the woman nor the child of the patient have so far been ill.\" At the affected company, the employees still go on and off on Tuesday - the decision on the temporary closure takes place only in the evening after the three other cases are becoming known. Outwardly there is previously normal operation at the car supplier Webasto prevails, even if one or the other at the entrance to the specifically provided hand disinfection. Most employees do not want to comment on the case. \"No comment\", it says again and again. An employee says it rules \"normal operation\". However, there are also uncertainty. Another reported, it was very quiet, apparently, many have stayed at home. The pharmacies in Gauting and in the entire W\u00fcrmtal experience an onslaught. What is needed after disinfectants, but above all after respiratory protection - sold out. However, such masks make no sense as the chairman of the German Society for Infectiology, Bernd Salzberger emphasized by the University of Regensburg. The so-called surgical facial masks are not made for protection against infections, but \nShould only prevent infectious droplets from the surgeon's breathing air from entering the surgical wound. \"But the protection against an outer infection is very, very bad,\" explains Salzberger. Also Martin High, Head of Task Force Infectiology on LGL emphasizes that the normal hand hygiene and \"cough tag\" is sufficient. In his special unit, there are cases such as the current a very concrete alarm plan with multiple escalation levels. Level One: Doctors throughout the country are informed and sensitized. That took place in the past week. With the first confirmed case, another escalation level is achieved: For example, information screens are switched at the airport - also in Chinese language. Escalation stage Three it is when checkers are the incoming passengers, very closely and measure the temperature about the remote thermometer.

shiite muslims alike. the saudi move expands a ban last week on foreigners visiting mecca and medina, home to the holiest sites in islam. that decision alone disrupted travel for thousands of muslims already headed to the kingdom and potentially affects plans later this year for millions more ahead of the fasting month of ramadan and the annual hajj pilgrimage. even after that announcement on feb.

foreigners in 2019 alone. it remains unclear how the ban will be enforced. the government described the suspension as temporary, but gave no hint at when it will be lifted. the ban also appeared to encompass the prophet muhammad's mosque in nearby medina. the decision seeks to limit the spread of the coronavirus (covid-19) epidemic and prevent its access to the two holy mosques, which are

A few hours later, in the morning, the news confirmed that the deaths have already surpassed a hundred and there were 4600 cases, with people infected inside and outside China, the epicenter of the public health emergence. And while many people questioned: Where will this stop? The truth is that despite the many guesses, predictions and estimates, no one knows how and when it will be possible to lock the coronavirus epidemic that began in December in the city of Wuhan in the province of Hubei, China. Yesterday, after a meeting with the Chinese Government, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, guarantee that \"locking the spread of this virus in China and globally is the priority of WHO.\" Despite this, WHO has already met twice and has not yet decreed the \"Global Emergency of Public Health.\" In the statement, it was also ensured that China and WHO experts will continue to collaborate with this common objective and to share information, praising China's transparency throughout this process, in particular with the dissemination of the virus genome earlier this month . The celebrations of the New Chinese Lunar Year were canceled, the holidays were prolonged undatected for the return of students to classes, it is mandatory to use mask, transport from and to the city of Wuhan, with 11 million inhabitants, were suspended. At least 17 Chinese cities are quarantined, a measure that affects about 50 million people. Transport throughout the country are conditioned. These are only a few of the many examples that can be given from the measures currently in force in China. The European Union activated the European Civil Protection Mechanism at France's request and will send two airplanes to Wuhan to repatriate 250 French and another 100 European citizens who request it, \"regardless of nationality.\" There are two dozens of Portuguese who remain in the Chinese city. In Germany was confirmed the first case on Monday night and this Tuesday evening came the official confirmation of three more infected people. Other countries, such as the United States and Japan are also preparing with the Chinese authorities the removal of their citizens from Wuhan. The number of deaths and the increase of about 60% of infected with three thousand new cases between Monday and Tuesday is scaring the world. It is important to break the transmission chain and this is done with the adoption of public health measures. But it will be somewhere between panic and indifference that will be the best possible response at this time. Unlike other outbreaks and other coronaviruses that circulated before the world, this public health problem seems to leave for the land with an important difference. is that this time the scientific community is, more than ever, the \nwork in conjunction with health professionals to quickly react to the problem. In addition, episodes such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (known as SARS) in 2003 or MERS in 2012 do not only serve to leave the number of victims but also to learn from the past of the past and profit from knowledge however acquired. In a video disclosed this week by WHO, the epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove, who directs the workgroup of infectious diseases with animals, reminded precisely that there are ongoing research lines that began after the problem of SARS and MERS that can help Now lock this new coronavirus. There is, for example, a clinical trial that recently started in Saudi Arabia that intends to test a new treatment and that can be useful for coronavirus that is now concerning the health authorities from all over the world, pointed out the same person in charge. Maria Van Kerkhove also emphasized that it was precisely the existing surveillance system in China since SARS who led to the identification in December of a new coronavirus that was to infect people. And this time, the information sharing was quick. In the early days of January, Chinese health authorities have publicly released the genetic sequence of the virus and the scientific community began working on top of these data. At present, there are several samples that have been sequenced, in a work that is decisive for rapid diagnosis and to realize how the virus is spreading. Collaboration at the scientific level and public health has been significant and can reveal itself the main enemy of this coronavirus. This is a new virus - and this will be your main advantage - about which there are still more questions than answers. In the video, which is published in WHO social networks, Maria Van Kerkhove answers some doubts of concerned citizens. The epidemiologist stressed, for example, that at this point the mortality rate is in the 4% adding that it is necessary to take into account that \"not everyone will have severe symptoms and die.\" This coronavirus, further advised, manifests with a variable gravity, from light symptoms similar to a flu or constipation to more severe symptoms such as pneumonia. The incubation period varies between two and 12 days and the WHO specialist admits that \"it is possible\" that infected and asymptomatic people can convey the virus. The possibility of being infected in contact with an order that comes from China (one of the doubts that have been placed to WHO) does not exist, ensures the specialist. On the possibility of the virus being acquiring mutations, Maria Van Kerkhove has just mentioned that there are many attentive scientists to this possibility but so far no evidence has yet emerged. You have to be careful with misinformation and you also serve the conspiracy theories that seem to be spreading more \nquickly than the virus. Data on the 2019-NCOV are updated daily, time the time. Subscribe newsletters for free and receive the best of the publicity and the deepest jobs of the public. \"There is a lot about the 2019-NCOV that we still do not realize,\" admitted on Tuesday the WHO Director-General, confirming that the \"source of the outbreak and its reach\" in the territory are still unknown. Despite this, the data show that in most cases the disease manifests itself through light symptoms and only 20% with severe symptoms. People who have so far been achieved with greater gravity are adults with other associated chronic diseases (as well as it happens in cases of seasonal flu). This is not to say there is no reason to worry. \"Both the WHO and China observed that the number of cases reported, including those outside China, is deeply worrisome. A better understanding of the transmission and severity of this virus is urgent and necessary to guide appropriate response measures in other countries, \"said the statement released yesterday by WHO.

C., touched each other only via Elbow bump, with the forearms, and no one touched the table, the stitch of the other. They coughed into the army. And told the right thing. Both applicants spoke sympathetically from the suffering nation, biders told of younger Americans who are standing outside the windows and communicate with the old parents there inside; Family love in Corona times, traceable for those who watched. \"This is war. And in war we do everything to save our people,\" said biders. \"I would use the military,\" said Sanders. And then this Sanders said this: \"We would have to turn off the guy.\" The guy, that's the president. On November 3, the first November Tuesday, the USA Donald Trump will either confirm or discontinue. Then it is chosen and there should be, it must remain, because so it wants the law since 1845. Two variants discussed on Twitter in the usual volume and, if the impression is not confident, it will not be feared: Trump must not cancel or move the choice; And therefore he can not remain in office by emergency ordinance - the constitution writes the swearing of the new Congress (3 January) and the term of office of the President (January 20). These three data but do not change the fact that everything has changed within a few days. Corona elections will be a vote on the Corona President. No other topic is only discussed in the US these days, only the economy, but also that is of course a corona economy. In four states are to take place on this Tuesday: In Florida, it is about 219 delegates for the electoral party of Democrats (scheduled from 14th to the 17th of August in Milwaukee), in Illinois around 155, in Ohio around 136 and in Arizona At 67. In all four states, bidets of the favorite, but no one knows how many people are trusting in the polling stations. And how many helpers and helpers will expect them there? People's collisions? touch things? now? So far, biders leads to Sanders with 898: 745 delegates; Anyone who first collected 1,991 delegates becomes the democratic candidate. \"I'm the right man right now,\" Biden said on Sunday, but that does not mean much, because that said Sanders in the past week. The three men - the two Democrats and the President - go quite different with the never previously experienced new situation. Trump has weeks \nMasterlike and lied, and he will know how much he hurts today. The virus already pulls through, such sentences he said in January, \"that's back soon\". From given occasion a short and incomplete trump-corona chronicle: January 22: \"We have it totally under control.\" January 24: \"China works hard to narrow the coronavirus. It will go out very well.\" January 29: \"We have the best experts in the world, and they have it 24/7 under control.\" February 2: \"We have locked out.\" February 7: \"I just had a long and very good conversation with President Xi from China.

So self-righteous. and dangerous. Trump called the virus in his television address last Wednesday \"foreign virus\". He said several times and explicitly that precaution and self-isolation are not necessary. He had saved and deleted the pandemieb\u00fcro in the White House, as it was part of the Deep State for him, the bureaucratic world of the experts he can do so at all. On Friday, in the Rose Garden of the White House, a PBS reporter then asked him and he said he knew nothing of the closure, so something pass and the question is \"mean\".

On the other hand, the new American reality is: national emergency, until yesterday evening 4,314 cases, 75 dead and one \nSuspected enormous dark figure, as there are hardly any tests. Chaotic information. Much too few hospital beds and ventilators. Locking hours. If today the next president was elected, Trump would be a feasded and reasonably chance to both, biders and Sanders.

Every day, Trump, 73, now gives press conferences, he wants to be as an acting, but still he puts on ten or twelve of his subordinated shoulder on shoulder behind him, and he patches with his hands on microphones, and he can Not remember to give others hand.

Sanders is the perspective of this election campaign and says, \"The man is unaware, a shame, a danger.\" All three, president and challenger, are grandfathers. Biden says he has no preliminary burden, thus count only age, but not physically to the risk group, which of course is a small meanness, because Sanders had a heart attack half a year ago.

The pandemewelle has begun. In the coming weeks, further thousands of people with the new coronavirus SARS-COV-2 will also be infected in Germany. Even if measures such as the prohibition of public events and behavioral changes work and succeed in delaying the highlight of the outbreak: there will be more deaths through the virus. Now it's about protecting all those who are particularly at risk: above all, older people, but also those of all ages that have chronic diseases whose immune system is weakened and now more than ever need our support. And everyone can help. It can not be repeated often enough: the older people, the more likely, infection with SARS-COV-2 also ends fatal. The first smaller studies suggested in January. Now this finding confirms more and more haunting. Most recently, a World Health Organization Expert Group, when she was traveling in China for nine days and the data of almost 56,000 infected evaluities treated in Chinese hospitals (PDF: Joint Mission Report Covid-19, 2020). According to these data, about 22 percent of the over 80-year-old infected with Covid-19 died. That's more than every fifth. For comparison: Overall, the fall mortality, ie the proportion of people died at the infection, was nearly four percent in this investigation. In truth, it is likely to be clearly underlying, as many infections are so mild that those concerned did not have to be treated in the hospital or did not even first stress because they did not go in medical treatment. In another large study with nearly 45,000 patients from China, about 15 percent of patients died at least 80 years old (CDC Weekly: Cere Novel, 2020). Among the 70- to 79-year-olds, every twelfth, ie eight percent, the disease, the 60- to 69-year-olds were 3.6 percent. This shows: From 50 to 60 years the risk is clearly increasing for a serious course of illness. Without a specific therapy and a vaccine, these people need a place on an intensive care unit, a ventilator and the circulation stabilizing agents. And these places threaten to be scarce. Of course, there may also be mild courses of a Covid 19 disease for people in high age. But they are unlikely, because with the years the body's defense works less well, researchers speak of immunoescence. \"For older people, it can happen that your body is due to late on the virus - the pathogen can spare more than younger ones,\" says the virologist Jonas Schmidt-Chanasite from the Bernhard Still Institute for Tropical Medicine. In many cases, this could make sure that the immune system later reacts and not just pathogens \nattacks, but also own body cells. \"Such a reaction is one of the causes why many old people with Covid-19 goes so bad.\" But even basic diseases can cause the virus to settle in the body and overcome its defensive lines. And in principle, this concerns people of all ages, which mainly have cardiovascular diseases, diabetes or hypertension. This increases the risk of a heavy COVID 19 infection, as researchers from China writing in the magazine The Lancet (Zhou et al., 2020). \"Pre-conditions reduce the performance of the body. The immune system has a harder to fight against the pathogens,\" says Schmidt-Chanasite. The obstacle diseased people regardless of their age. But older ones are particularly affected because they do not only have a pre-disease, but several. The Robert Koch Institute also names individuals with chronic illnesses of the liver and the lungs, people who suffer from cancer or have immunodeficiency as well as smokers. COVID-19 is a pulmonary disease, so everything the respiratory tract can be charged or hurts directly to become a problem. Of course, cigarettes include cigarettes, but sometimes evaporators. Smoking could at least be a cause at least in China that men are more likely to die from infection than women. Because there smoking is rather men's thing. Whether this assumption confirms, further data must show. In particularly difficult by SARS COV-2 Italy is the age of more than three quarters of the reported patients at over 50 years, about 40 percent are older than 70. That could be one of the reasons why there are currently many people there SARS-COV-2 die. Currently more than 1,000 dead are reported. Here we also know: The intensive care units of hospitals just in Lombardy are currently overloaded. And that, although the clinics in the region around Milan belong to the best organized the country, as Italy's most famous virologist Roberto Burioni declares online in an interview interview. \"If the epidemic spreads into other, structurally weak regions, everything could get worse,\" says Burioni. In such a situation more people can die, which would survive under normal circumstances (The Lancet: JI et al., 2020). For example, if there are no intensive care beds more free for patients with severe heart disease or kidney problems and therefore they do not get important therapies or delayed. According to the German hospital company, there are around 28,000 in Germany from such beds, and in winter, they are often occupied by patients with influenza or bacterial infection despite fluids, antibiotics and vaccinations. \"Germany is still far away from a situation as in Italy,\" says Clemens Wendtner, Chief Physician at Munich Clinic Schwabing. the \nThe most important thing is to slow down the outbreak in such a way that as little as possible Corona-sufferers must be supplied and ventilated at once. The only way to create that has now recommended the Federal Government and the Chancellor: Reduce social contacts where it only works. For this social distance, scientists and politicians have been promoting weeks. Because it remains important: There should currently be as few people as possible with SARS COV-2 to win time. Days and weeks that can help relieve clinics, caregivers and doctors. Only when everyone and every contacts avoid, the likelihood that particularly undiscovered infected infected symptoms are infected with all those persons who could severely collect Covid-19. The World Health Organization WHO has specifically assembled advice for older and pre-patients, as they can protect themselves from the new coronavirus infection (WHO: Situation Report -51). Here are the most important summarized: This does not succeed, it could be difficult: \"More viruses are then unrecognized in hospitals, staff - who is already scarce anyway - and other patients are stuck and chaotic states, says Jonas Schmidt Chanasite. Such situations in which the hospital operation is disturbed, the Hamburg virologen would also harm patients who have nothing to do with the coronavirus. Although a kernel-healthy 26-year-old student can also be infected with the new coronavirus. The infection can be heavy with her, and it is not excluded that it dies on the new Covid-19 pneumonia. Only that is not likely. Because most young people are infection with SARS COV-2 mild. This means a disease can be cured at home, maybe with some fever and coughing or similar symptoms. Of the almost 45,000 infected from the second major study from China, only a single person is listed, the age between ten and 19 was and died, among patients between 20 and 29 years were seven. For this reason, young adults, children and pregnant women play in the current outbreak of SARS-COV-2, above all, the role of the carriers. They bring the virus to the old and sick, for example at the Sunday family reunion, on the shooting festival, in the fully occupied theater or when grandma and grandpa afternoon for a few hours watch out for a few hours. For most, the symptoms of COVID-19 may be so harmless that they should hardly be aware under normal circumstances that they are a danger to others: about 88 percent of the Hospital patients from the WHO study had fever, about two-thirds of dry coughs . Somewhat were symptoms such as headaches, a clogged nose or even rare diarrhea. That was really dangerous \nVirus less than one fifth of the infected. Heavy progressions with shortness of breath experienced just under 14 percent and critically ran about six percent of cases. That is, sufferers had to be artificially ventilated. The situation is similar in Germany, where the Robert Koch Institute has published in 737 of more than 2,000 cases more accurate medical data. Only with twelve of them, ie 1.6 percent, a pneumonia was diagnosed. Most infected sufferers among cough, fever or cold (pdf: daily management report of the RKI of 11 March 2020). There are also good news: Children illicit relatively rarely at Covid-19, although they can infect as well as adults. At least, a study still published without a scientific opinion suggests nearby researching symptoms and pathways of around 400 infected and their relatives have analyzed (Medrxiv: Bi et al., 2020). In it showed that children were almost as often in a diseased family member as older. And that, although the age of the most registered CovID-19 infected is significantly higher, between 30 and 69 years. Only 2.4 percent of the people studied in the WHO survey study were 18 years old or younger. \"The immune system of children responds slightly differently than that of adults,\" says the virologist Schmidt-Chanasite. That diseases in adults were much heavier, one knows about the chickenpox. What is in the case of SARS-COV-2, there is no sufficient data - only assumptions: \"For example, it may be that the binding sites that use the virus to penetrate into the human cell are less designed As in older ones. \" Viruses could get more difficult in the cells to make damage. Many children who were examined in the WHO survey study had such mild symptoms that one only discovered their infection if someone was sick of the family and then routinely tested all persons in the environment. \"Children are virus carriers, even if they hardly notice in the statistics,\" says Wendtner. He has already treated several Covid-19-ill patients. Among them a family in which a 12-year-old child has greatly infected his family members. \"Even in this case, the child had only mild symptoms,\" says Wendtner. So there is the danger that children - even though that has been rarely observed - bring the virus from the kindergarten or school to the family. Another group normally protected from other pathogens is pregnant women. For many infectious diseases, they are considered a risk group because their immune system is more prone to infections. For this reason, it is specifically advised to vaccinate against the flu. But what else is particularly vulnerable, could be in the case of the new one \nCoronavirus be an advantage. \"In pregnancy, the body of a woman is quasi completely reprogrammed,\" says Schmidt-Chanasite. \"The hormone levels are different, the immune system reacts.\" The games may be a role why pregnant women are often less difficult by COVID-19 after previous findings than from other infections. A study of nine pregnant women with Covid-19 also suggested that the virus is probably not passed on to their children - not in the growing up in the uterus and not over the breast milk (The Lancet: Chen et al., 2020).

immunity may also bring an early treatment. antibodies gathered from the bodies of those who have recovered may be used to aid those struggling with the illness caused by the coronavirus, called covid-19.   on tuesday (march 24), the food and drug administration approved the use of plasma from recovered patients to treat some severe cases. a day earlier, governor andrew cuomo announced that new york would become the first state to begin testing serum from people who have recovered from covid-19 to treat those who are seriously ill.   \u201cit\u2019s a trial for people who are in serious condition, but the new york state department of health has been working on this with some of new york\u2019s best health care agencies, and we think it shows promise,\u201d mr cuomo said.   the body\u2019s first line of defence against an infectious virus is an antibody called immunoglobulin m, whose job is to stay vigilant in the body and alert the rest of the immune system to intruders like viruses and bacteria.   days into an infection, the immune system refines this antibody into a second type, called immunoglobulin g, exquisitely designed to recognise and neutralize a specific virus.   the refinement may take as long as a week; both the process and the potency of the final antibodies can vary. some people make powerful neutralising antibodies to an infection, while others mount a milder response.   the antibodies generated in response to infection with some viruses \u2014 polio or measles, for example \u2014 bestow a lifetime of immunity. but antibodies to the coronaviruses that cause the common cold persist for just one to three years \u2014 and that may be true of their new cousin as well.   a study in macaques infected with the new coronavirus suggested that once infected, the monkeys produce neutralising antibodies and resist further infection. but it is unclear how long the monkeys, or people infected with the virus, will remain immune.   most people who became infected during the sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic \u2014 that virus is a close cousin of the new coronavirus, called \nsars-cov-2 \u2014 had long-term immunity lasting eight to 10 years, said dr vineet d. menachery, a virologist at the university of texas medical branch at galveston.   those who recovered from middle east respiratory syndrome (mers), another coronavirus, saw much shorter-term protection, dr menachery said. people who have been infected with the new coronavirus may have immunity lasting at least one to two years, he added: \u201cbeyond that, we can\u2019t predict.\u201d   still, even if antibody protection were short-lasting and people become reinfected, the second bout with the coronavirus would likely be much milder than the first, said dr florian krammer, a microbiologist at the icahn school of medicine at mount sinai in new york.   even after the body stops producing neutralising antibodies, a subset of immune memory cells can reactivate a response effectively, he noted.   \u201cyou probably would make a good immune response before you even become symptomatic again and might really blunt the course of the disease,\u201d dr krammer said.   a crucial question is whether children and adults who have only mild symptoms still generate a strong enough response to remain immune to the virus until a vaccine is available.   dr marion koopmans, a virologist at erasmus university in rotterdam, and her team have screened antibody responses in 15 infected patients and health care workers.   the researchers are also using banked blood samples from about 100 people who were known to be infected with one of four coronaviruses known to cause the common cold.   if those samples show some immune response to the new coronavirus, too, dr koopmans said, it might explain why some people \u2014 children, for example \u2014 have only mild symptoms. they may have antibodies to related coronaviruses that are at last somewhat effective against the new one.   the quickest way to assess immunity is a blood test that looks for protective antibodies in the blood of people who have recovered. but first you have to have the test.   antibody tests are used in singapore, china and a handful of other countries. but they are just coming to market in much of the west.   last week, dr krammer and his colleagues developed one such antibody test that could be scaled up in \u201cdays to weeks\u201d, he said.   the team validated the test in blood plasma taken from three patients with covid-19. the researchers are seeking speedy approval from the fda.   dozens of other labs are also at work on a dizzying list of tests, although they, too, are mostly based on slim data that has not yet been reviewed by other scientists.   \u201cno matter who makes them, as long as they\u2019re reliable, that\u2019s a super nice tool,\u201d dr krammer said. because this is a new coronavirus, the test should deliver \u201cbasically, a yes or no answer, like an hiv test \u2014 you can figure out who was exposed and who wasn\u2019t\u201d.   on wednesday, officials of public health england said they had purchased millions of newly developed antibody tests and were evaluating them for patients to \nuse at home. citizens who discovered they had been exposed and now had some immunity to the coronavirus might be able to return to normal lives, the officials said.   that would be particularly useful for health care workers. those who know they have at least some immunity could be placed on the front lines of emergency care, sparing colleagues who have not been exposed.   \u201cif this really goes on for months at a time, for 18 months as some people have projected, having health care workers who are immune to the virus will be really, really helpful,\u201d said dr angela rasmussen, a virologist at columbia university in new york.   but tests like these may not be of much use for diagnosis of coronavirus infection as it gets underway, because of the time it takes for the body to begin producing antibodies.   dr krammer\u2019s test picks up an antibody response as early as three days after symptoms emerge. given that people may not show symptoms for as long as 14 days after infection, however, that is too late for the test to be useful as a diagnostic tool.   finding people with powerful antibody responses might help point the way to new treatments, however. essentially, antibodies extracted from the blood of recovered patients are injected into those who are ill.   several teams have already been working on such an effort, following early reports from china of success. a beijing-based company called anygo technology has provided 50,000 tests to the chinese centre for disease control and prevention, and to hospitals in wuhan, beijing and shanghai, according to its founder, dr le sun.   dr shangen zheng, a doctor with the chinese military, said his team had treated more than 10 patients so far, and data from many more patients treated with plasma in hubei province is being assessed.   this approach is actually \u201csomething very old-fashioned\u201d, dr krammer said. it was used to save american soldiers infected with the hemorrhagic hantaan virus during the korean war, and to treat people in argentina infected with the hemorrhagic junin virus.   before the method can be put into wide use, however, scientists must work out safety issues, such as ensuring that the plasma taken from recovered patients is free of other viruses and toxins.   pharmaceutical companies like takeda and regeneron are hoping to sidestep some of those questions by developing antibodies against the coronavirus in the laboratory.   ultimately, it is only with these tests that scientists will be able to say when enough of the population has been infected and has become immune \u2014 and when the virus has begun to run out of hosts. the new york times ", "label": 1}, {"content": "send clear

(please note: seizures aren't a symptom of the novel coronavirus.) doctors (elliott gould) across borders are trying to formulate a vaccine, and it's a race against time, with each passing moment adding to the number of people who are succumbing to the virus. heads of medical research centres (laurence fishburne) send medical professionals (kate winslet) to research the root of the virus. but even they are infected, they die trying to save the world, and are reduced to just a body bag. schools have been shut, cities have gone under lockdown, grocery stores are being looted for basic amenities like cereal, and eventually, angry, hungry mobs break into houses to steal your food. they kill if they have to because survival is the only question at this point. along with the virus, the world is fighting misinformation. forsinthia, a herbal immunity booster available in china is declared a cure by a blogger (jude law) with millions of followers. sick patients line up for it at the drug store, and loot it when they don't get it, but even those who do aren't cured. does it not remind you of the whatsapp \nforward you received about gaumutra this week? some (matt damon) are immune to this. their naturally strong immune system keeps them safe. but they still cannot risk exposing themselves and remain in quarantine - sealing their homes off, rubbing sanitiser on their palms every now and then. soderbergh's contagion is so fast-paced that you don't realise just how much time has gone by fighting this virus, save for two dialogues. one at the beginning by a world leader reluctant to order shutting of schools, \"thanksgiving is the biggest shopping weekend; this virus couldn't have found a better time,\" and one towards the middle, when a tired medical researcher (jennifer ehle) says, \"i'm going home now, merry christmas.\" and finally, you realise its time for the school prom - almost half a year has gone by. contagion ends on a somewhat positive note. a vaccine has been found, except it has to be systematically distributed now. which means the creme of the crop - the rich, the bureaucrats, the celebrities - will get it first, while for the masses, a surreal, almost dystopian game of bingo decides their fate. the ball reads march 10, so those born on this date get the vaccine, as others wait for another 144 days for the second batch of the medicine to be manufactured. in this new normal, a wrist tag separates the vaccinated from the not. welcome to hotel quarantine. the last scene of contagion is basically day 1 of the story. where it all began - an infected bat drops a morsel of food at a pig farm, it is consumed by a pigling which is then transported to a top restaurant and served on a platter to gwyneth paltrow in hong kong. and the world comes tumbling down. the most important lesson we can learn from contagion is that you can never be prepared. but the only thing that can get you through this, or any calamity, is level-headedness. a truckload of common sense, a large share of awareness and all the patience you can get your hands on will sail you - us - through this. breathe.

'baptism by fire' the virus that causes covid-19 gives most people only mild symptoms but can also cause severe illness, including pneumonia. the vast majority of people who get it survive. assuming the \nnumbers reported to the world health organization are accurate, many of the countries with lower caseloads are relatively isolated geographically: singapore, new zealand, nepal, bhutan, sri lanka, mongolia. some others may be latecomers in testing and reporting: russia, indonesia, vietnam. for singapore, taiwan and hong kong, the experience of battling the 2003 sars outbreak, which infected some 8,000 people and killed nearly 800, helped ensure residents took the risks seriously, experts say. \"almost everyone played ball and followed accordingly,\" said leong hoe nam, an infectious diseases specialist at singapore's mount elizabeth novena hospital. \"sars was our baptism by fire and we were forced to learn everything by swimming in the deep end of the pool.\" after the sars outbreak, when 238 people were infected and 33 died in singapore, the city revamped its already excellent health care system, writing up new protocols for containing outbreaks. it set up \"fever centers\" to isolate suspected cases, invested in equipment and improved training in handling infectious diseases, leong said. so when the first case of covid-19 was discovered, singapore was ready to act, he said. from feb. 1, singapore blocked entry and transit for new visitors who had traveled to mainland china within 14 days. these restrictions have since expanded to include visitors with recent travel to iran, northern italy or south korea. when the number of local cases without links to previous cases or travel in china surged, the government raised its alert to \"orange,\" the second-highest level, on feb. 7. the singapore air show, a huge event that draws thousands, scaled back the number of participants and barred most exhibitors and visitors from china from attending. good hygiene and avoiding handshakes were recommended. the national public health laboratory, set up after sars, was prepared to fast-track testing, using advanced diagnostics and newly developed covid-19 test kits. rapid testing and isolation of suspected cases, and painstaking tracing of contacts, helped by police, surveillance videos and atm records, have helped prevent a worse local outbreak, said tikki pangestu, a visiting professor at the lee kuan yew school of public policy and former director of who's research policy and cooperation department. once a covid-19 case is confirmed, singapore embarks on \"diligent contract tracing,\" said pangestu. it ordered workers arriving from countries with endemic virus infections to stay home. worship services were suspended in favor of livestreaming after a cluster was found at a church. schools suspended mass assemblies and staggered recess. so far, 5,700 people have been quarantined. 'we don't leave anyone behind' in thailand, too, public health workers have gone door-to-door to track down contacts, said thanarak plipat, deputy director-general of the disease control department of the health ministry. \"we must go see them ourselves. this is an old public health way. we do \nour best,\" he said. it has mostly worked. but newly confirmed clusters show one dinner, one boxing match or one religious gathering can undo weeks of work. initially, germany was thought to have done relatively well at slowing the spread, but infections there have jumped to 9,360. in south korea, where more than 270,000 people have been tested, newly discovered cases are dropping sharply, but clusters are still popping up, at a call center, at a church where worshipers shared a spray bottle of salt water to \"disinfect\" each other. this week, malaysia has reported a surge in cases linked to a religious gathering in its capital at the end of february. cambodia, thailand and indonesia also have confirmed new cases linked to that gathering. it's unclear if strategies used in an authoritarian society like singapore can prevail in bigger places where people expect greater personal freedoms. but as virus controls expand to unprecedented levels in many other countries, the policies are looking prescient. singapore is a small island with strong public trust in the government, \"a strong healthcare system, excellent information systems and plenty of money,\" said pangestu. \"many other countries, especially developing ones, do not have these capacities or characteristics.\" prime minister lee hsien loong, lauded for adopting a calming, clear approach early on, said in a televised talk last week that the situation was under control but the government was planning ahead, trying to free up hospital beds to be prepared for any surge in cases. singaporeans \"feel we are all in this together,\" lee said, \"and we don't leave anyone behind.\" ", "label": 1}, {"content": "update 1-oregon cites its first 'presumptive' coronavirus case, one of unknown origin.

misinformation has taken the centre-stage on social media. many conspiracy theories are doing rounds on facebook, twitter whatsapp and their chinese parallels. scientific magazine nature has quoted international health workers as saying that the case-report data that are being released by the chinese authorities are incomplete. researchers are struggling to accurately model the outbreak and predict how it might unfold. this has given a field day to misinformation - due to lack of credible information - and conspiracy theories attributing the wuhan coronavirus outbreak to leakage of biological weapon and what chinese people eat. a leakage of bio-weapon this could be a case of fear-mongering at a time when health authorities around the world are on tenterhooks over the outbreak of coronavirus infection spreading from hubei province of china. that \"mystery\" lab is the wuhan institute of virology. wuhan is the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak. the former israeli spy has been identified in the reports as an expert in virology (study of viruses) and claims that the wuhan institute of virology had been engaged in development of secret biological weapon for chinese military. however, no health agency has backed their claim, which continued to gain traction from the fact that the authorities have pinpointed the source of novel coronavirus -- from animals to humans - in a fish and animal market some 25-30 km from the virology lab. it was in this fish and animal market that the coronavirus is believed to have infected humans first in early december. but alarm bells started ringing only on january 20, when 14 health workers treating pneumonia patients were reported ill. this was the first instance when human-to-human infection of coronavirus was confirmed in the current outbreak. espionage with canada connection another widely circulated theory of the coronavirus outbreak emerges from the sacking of two chinese scientist couple working with the national microbiology lab in winnipeg, canada. they along with their students had been sacked last year and escorted out of the building of the winnipeg lab for suspected policy breach. now, many social media influencers are claiming that the chinese scientists had sent coronavirus to wuhan lab, the only level-4 lab in china, last year. the coronavirus escaped the wuhan lab, it is being claimed, largely because the chinese scientists lacked expertise in dealing with this particular virus, which is highly mutable strand of \nrna (ribonucleic acid, which is protein with genetic properties). pharma conspiracy conspiracy theorists called it a planned outbreak for the gain of pharma companies involved with coronavirus vaccination. they linked it with bill and melinda gates foundation, which is said to have funded both the pirbright institute and vaccine development. bat soup one video clip and a screengrab of it showing a woman eating bat are being circulated with claims that the current strand of coronavirus has reached humans due to the eating habits of the chinese people. the woman is heard saying in the video that the cooked bat tastes like chicken meat. some factchekers have traced the video to a palau in western pacific ocean, and dated some time in 2016. the video is completely unrelated to wuhan coronavirus outbreak. the fact that the authorities identified an animal market as the source of coronavirus outbreak and that bats could be a possible origin point have made people believe in misinformation coming with the old video. bigger than chinese projection this is about 15 times more the figure of infected people put out by the chinese government. according to official data, over 6,000 people have contracted the coronavirus infection and close to 130 deaths so far. the video is said to be recorded by a nurse working in a wuhan hospital. she is wearing a protective mask and does not identify herself as a health worker in the video, whose english translation is getting much traction on social media. the authenticity of the video remains unverified mainly due to complete lockdown of wuhan city and hubei province of china. but for the claim about the number of coronavirus infected people to be true, the r0 or r-naught need to be many times higher than what the world health organisation (who) said last week. r0 refers to the number of people that the virus tends to infect from an already infected person. the who said the current corornavirus has an estimated r0 of 1.4 to 2.5. for 90,000 people to have been infected since the outbreak of coronavirus, r0 should be around 14-15.

In the absence of medications or vaccines to combat the new coronavirus, several researchers around the world think that the key to treat the new Covid-19 may be in the blood of those who have already recovered from the disease.\nThe technique goes through the management to patients who are still fighting the blood serum infection obtained from the blood of people who have recovered from Covid-19 disease. The idea is that they can use the antibodies developed by patients already recovered.\nIn the last month, the proposal was defended by immunologists at John Hopkins University, Doctors in Shanghai, China, who are already testing the method, and researchers from the pharmaceutical company Takeda Pharmaceutical, Japan, who want to create a new medicine with the antibodies .\nThe use of blood serum from cured people to treat others is an old practice, with more than a century, used when there is no other means of treating a disease. One of the first success cases dates back to 1918 when doctors in the US showed that using blood transfusions from survivors of the pandemic that became known as \"Spanish flu\" to treat serious patients led to a 50% reduction in the mortality of patients hospitalized in the hospital Chelsea naval in Massachusetts.\nThe technique fell in disuse around the 1950s, with the discovery of more effective treatments, but has been used in 2003, in China, in the treatment of some people infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), another coronavirus And during the daily struggle against the Ebola outbreak between 2014 and 2016 in Guinea-Conakri, Liberia and Sierra Leone.\n\"It is an option that does not require any investigation or development,\" explains Arturo Casadevall, immunologist at John Hopkins University in a statement published on the University's website. \"It's all feasible - but so that it's a need for an effort to organize, resources and people who have recovered from the disease and can donate blood.\"\nDoctors in China that began to treat patients infected with Covid-19 with blood serum of survivors have reported positive results, especially when the method is applied soon the disease. In an interview with Al-Jazeera last week, Zhang Wenhong, the leader of a medical team sent from Shanghai to Wuhan, said the technique may \"reduce the time needed to treat the disease of five to 10 days for three to five days\" .\nSubscribe newsletters for free and receive the best of the publicity and the deepest jobs of the public.\nThe method is not risk-free, but the World Health Organization has published guidance to ensure its security already in 2014: the blood of any donor will have to be tested for certain pathogens such as hepatitis and AIDS virus. \"It's a very important area to follow,\" said the director of the WHO emergency program, Mike Ryan, noting that the technique has shown \"effective\" in combating other infectious diseases such as diphtheria.\nThe use of blood serum from recovered patients works because people who recover from a disease are antibodies, generated by their immune system in blood plasma (the liquid component of the blood). By isolating these antibodies, one can provide a \"passive immunity\" to people who are still sick.\nThe advantage conferred by this type of immunity is its immediate action, that is, the availability of antibodies in the patient's body shortly after serum administration. The disadvantage is the temporary character of the antibodies in the body of the patients. a way of achieving active immunization, produced by the body itself, are the vaccines, which involve exposure to attenuated or inactivated pathogens (so as not to do bad) or pieces of these microorganisms, to force the body to produce antibodies against the disease .

urgent request. the italian authorities wanted his help for an all-out effort to meet a desperate need for ventilators.    now, his bologna-based company, siare engineering international group s.r.l., has 25 army technicians working with its production supervisors to manage the expanded production and help assemble machines. the army also has made personnel available to the company\u2019s suppliers, preziosa said.    \u201cusually we produce 160 machines a month. the goal is to produce 2,000 in four months, so more than triple our monthly production,\u201d preziosa told reuters in an interview. the executive added that companies involved in the supply chain of producing ventilators \u201ccannot respond to the enormous demand because this is a niche industry.\u201d    siare belongs to a normally quiet corner of the medical equipment market that has found itself on the front line of the century\u2019s biggest health crisis caused by the rapid spread of the new flu-like virus, which can lead to breathing difficulties and pneumonia in severe cases.    ventilator makers are under pressure to sharply increase production even as the pandemic has disrupted the transport and supply of crucial parts, such as hoses, valves, motors and electronics \u2013 some of which come from china, the original epicentre of the outbreak that has killed more than 10,000 people across the globe.    amid shortages, governments are turning to help from the military, enlisting other manufacturers and even looking to 3d printing in the hopes of ramping up production of the potentially life-saving breathing machines. in italy, a team of doctors has developed a way to provide oxygen to two people from one ventilator, therefore doubling capacity, according to the italian region of emilia romagna\u2019s commissioner for coronavirus.    ventilators, which cost tens of thousands of dollars, are mechanical breathing devices that can blow air and oxygen into the lungs. they are crucial for the care of people with lung failure, which can be one of the complications suffered by patients with severe covid-19, the disease coronavirus causes. but they don\u2019t necessarily save people.    \"the mortality amongst the intensive care population is being estimated as 50 to 60%,\" said rahuldeb sarkar, a consultant physician in respiratory medicine and critical care in britain. if a critically ill patient doesn\u2019t get a ventilator, \u201che dies within a few hours.\"    one of the world\u2019s largest makers of ventilators, swiss-based hamilton medical ag, expects to increase production to about 21,000 ventilators this year, up from 15,000 last year by deploying marketing staff on the production line, among other measures. but with many more orders than it can fulfill, the company faces difficult decisions on where to send them.    hamilton medical\u2019s chief executive, andreas wieland, said \nthe company is prioritizing those countries where the need is most dire, notably italy. hamilton medical sent 400 ventilators to italy last week and expects to send another shipment soon. but, he said, that also means turning some governments down, which has resulted in one country reacting aggressively by threatening to blacklist his company.    \u201cwe're trying not to deliver into a country that is merely stocking up reserves, where there is practically no virus, so they can prepare. we're trying to serve those where the emergency is most extreme.\u201d    the global ventilators market is worth more than $1 billion annually, according to hamilton medical, which says it has roughly a quarter share of revenue. other ventilator makers include u.s.-based resmed inc, getinge ab of sweden, germany\u2019s draegerwerk ag, and china\u2019s beijing aeonmed co, ltd.    companies say demand has topped out in china but is surging, from italy, elsewhere in europe and the united states as the virus continues to spread. more than quarter of a million cases of coronavirus have been reported.       bottlenecks    in italy, where more than 4,000 people have died from the virus, hospitals are suffering severe shortages of ventilation and other equipment, as well as medical staff. the first products resulting from the army technicians\u2019 work at siare should start coming out from saturday, a spokesman for italy\u2019s defence ministry said.    the italian government has also purchased nearly 4,000 of the 5,000 units of ventilating and other equipment it tendered for earlier this month. in germany, where hospitals had about 20,000 ventilators before the outbreak, the government has placed an order for 10,000 machines from draegerwerk \u2013 the equivalent to a year\u2019s normal production at the company. demand in france, which is usually for about 1,000 to 1,500 ventilators annually, has increased to hundreds per week, said christophe hentze, director-general of the french unit of l\u00f6wenstein medical innovation gmbh, a german medical equipment maker, speaking on france info radio.    britain\u2019s health minister has said the country needs \u201cas many ventilators as we can get our hands on.\u201d    but getting the parts can be difficult at a time when some countries are shutting borders or taking steps to safeguard stocks of medical supplies.    hamilton medical's wieland said romanian authorities had in recent weeks halted a shipment of ventilator hoses that his company makes in a factory there on the ground that it could be important medical equipment. wieland said he needed the intervention of the swiss consulate in romania before custom officials allowed it out.    \"we had to use political channels to let them know that these products, by themselves, aren't valuable to them,\" wieland said.    a spokesman for switzerland\u2019s foreign ministry said: 'our ambassador in bucharest was in contact with the romanian authorities to contribute to the resolution of the situation.\u201d romanian officials did not immediately \nrespond to a request for comment.    sweden\u2019s getinge has had experiences of \u201cbottlenecks\u201d at suppliers that it has so far managed to solve, partly with the help of politicians, said chief executive, mattias perjos. getinge says it plans to increase output by 60%, from about 10,000 ventilators last year.    in china, medical device manufacturer beijing aeonmed relies on imports from countries including switzerland, the united states and netherlands for key components such as valves and turbines to make ventilators, said purchasing director wang xue. but the company\u2019s international suppliers have experienced difficulties during the global outbreak in sourcing some basic parts to produce the components it needs.    \u201cif the imported materials cannot be supplied in time, the production capacity of some [ventilator] models will be severely affected,\u201d she said. \u201cwe are calling our foreign suppliers every day.\u201d beijing aeonmed says it has tried to help its international suppliers to replace those previously foreign-made supportive components with china-made alternatives. the company said it has capacity to produce about 1,500 ventilators for overseas orders this month and hopes to increase that to 4,000 in april.       car makers    some countries, including italy, britain and the united states, are drafting automakers and aerospace manufacturers to ramp up ventilator production. authorities hope big manufacturers can repurpose some factories and use digital design expertise, including 3d printing, to make up the expected shortfall in vital medical hardware.    in britain, the government has turned to other manufacturers. mclaren group ltd., a conglomerate that includes a sports-car maker, is looking at how to design a simple version of a ventilator. nissan motor co, is working with others to support existing ventilator producers.    on friday, britain said engineering companies had come up with an emergency ventilator prototype that could be approved next week.\u201cwe need as many as you can possibly make and we will buy them,\u201d said britain\u2019s health minister matt hancock.    the british government has said it has increased its stocks to about 8,000 ventilators. the head of britain's national health service told a parliamentary panel he expects that to increase to just under 12,000 over the next several weeks.       border barriers    u.s. ventilator maker resmed has reallocated resources away from producing other devices to meet demand that is more than four times normal levels, said its chief executive, mick farrell.    one issue has been restrictions on travel intended to stem the spread of coronavirus, which has affected resmed\u2019s singapore factory which employs many workers from neighbouring malaysia. he said resmed has appealed to the malaysian government for an exemption so its workers can travel to singapore.    in the united states, hospitals are considering re-deploying older ventilators, which still work but had been abandoned because they don't \nconnect to modern electronic records systems, while the u.s. department of defense has donated 2,000 ventilators, said nancy foster, vice president of the american hospital association. \u201chospitals are also looking into re-purposing the machines that administer anesthesia to be used as ventilators.\"    the united states had equipment to provide ventilation to about 160,000 people, according to research compiled by the johns hopkins center for

as with hiv or septicemia patients, the bodies of those who die of covid-19 have to be cleaned with bleach, placed in body bags and cremated in an electric crematorium within two hours. with the

double, with order values going up by 20 per cent on average. a spokesperson for grofers reports a 400 per cent and 120 per cent increase in sales of hand sanitisers and hand wash, respectively. the

for the panicked and alarmed residents of the national capital. groups of people coughing or suffering from fever arrive almost daily to be tested for the virus, only to be told that they don\u2019t fit the bill for testing. the indian council of medical research (icmr) has opted for the random sampling method instead of expanding the test criteria. it will not test those who have not travelled abroad or met anyone who has. india has so far tested close to 12,000 people. dr k.k. aggarwal, former president of the indian medical association, says, if you do not test people, how will you know if the disease has reached community-level transmission and which are the potential danger areas? the icmr has already said that community spread is inevitable; if that is the case, why the delay in testing? at this point, there is no certainty if there has been a community spread of the disease since india is not mandatorily \nquarantining every foreign returnee or testing or following up on asymptomatic travellers (who could still be carriers of the virus). meghna bhasin, 28, a resident of panchsheel park in new delhi, who returned from france on march 16, says, what upset many of us was the lack of caution at the delhi airport. people who were really unwell were asking why they had to sit in a closed space with others. the people handling the situation had not been briefed on protocol, many of them came near us without mask or protective gear; we could have easily infected them. preethi chandran, 38, a software engineer, who returned from a holiday to dubai last week, had the opposite experience when she landed in kochi. we were screened for temperature and symptoms. i had a few questions about home quarantine, which the doctor answered. they handed out water and information kits while we were waiting to be screened. i have now isolated myself at home for two weeks, she says. those who have been facility-quarantined also have mixed reports about the experience. when rekha damani (name chan\u00adged), a 23-year-old resident of mira road in mumbai, returned from dubai on march 1, she was showing no symptoms of covid-19. even so, she got herself quarantined at the kasturba gandhi hospital for 14 days. it was an ordeal she is unlikely to forget soon, she says. there were 28 suspected patients in her ward, situated at one end of the hospital. everyone in the ward was tense. there were no visitors. nobody knew anyone else. the only solace in the ward was a television set, she recalls. the unhygienic toilets and the insipid food only made her isolation worse. however, others like abira dhar rao, who was also quarantined in the same hospital, have reports of clean beds and toilets. the quarantined apart, those working out of home or children on enforced vacation are grappling with problems of a different sort. jaspreet singh, 42, who works with a software company in jaipur, has been working from home for the past few days. his 10-year-old son is also home. i have a 2bhk house with a small living and dining area. there is no space for me to work in peace. i would be writing a line of code or attending a business call and my son starts screaming in the background or banging the door shut. it is very difficult to manage like this, he says. singh\u2019s wife and mother are also complaining. having him and their child at home has cut into their leisure time. earlier, we would spend the entire afternoon watching television or chatting with friends. now we have to cook three meals and find ways to keep our son engaged so that he does not disturb my husband. i haven\u2019t been to the beauty parlour in a week, says avni, singh\u2019s wife. families across the country can sympathise with avni\u2019s ordeal, as keeping children occupied has become a mandatory chore. e-learning providers such as byju\u2019s and coursera are now looking to partner with schools so that some lessons and activities can be

innovative games and experiments on art, science, general knowledge and mathematics. even if your child is not going to school, she can spend time with books. you can get her a membership to a nearby library. he social upheaval apart, covid-19 is also exacting a heavy toll on businesses. the united nations conference on trade and development estimates that global trade would be affected to the extent of $1 trillion, with the india impact pegged at $348 million. experts think this figure is conservative, and mainly reflects supply chain disruptions from china (which, by the way, are easing) and not the economic distress owing to new cases emerging in several indian states. this cannot be good news for an economy already tottering at an anaemic 4.7 per cent growth in the third quarter. many believe g dp growth for fy20 will be sub-5 per cent. growth in the first quarter of fy21 will be equally lacklustre. the impact of covid-19 on the indian economy could be between 0.5 and 1 per cent for the first quarter of 2021, says madan sabnavis, chief economist with ratings agency care ratings. this is because multiple sectors, including banking, will be hit, since non-performing assets or bad loans could spike as industries underperform. meanwhile, stock markets have seen a bloodbath of their own in the past few days. even as us federal reserve brought down interest rates to near zero, it failed to calm markets, with wall street registering its steepest fall since 1987 on march 16. in india, benchmark indices fell 1,709 points on march 18, taking the sensex to 28,869 points from 38,000 just 12 days ago. never mind that the reserve bank of india had just two days before announced measures to improve long-term liquidity in the banking system or that crude oil prices have fallen more than 30 per cent, which could significantly reduce india\u2019s import bill and ease the current account deficit and inflation. key sectors continue to be spooked by the outbreak. supply chain disruptions apart, lack of demand is affecting sales of mobile phones, electronics and automotives. auto sales in the first 11 months of the current fiscal saw a drop of 12.7 per cent over the previous fiscal. with just one month left, the decline is expected to put pressure on the overall sales for the year and restrict growth going forward,\u2019 says a care ratings research note. the aviation and hospitality businesses, perhaps, are paying the heaviest price for the global aff\u00adliction. we have almost lost the first quarter of international travel because of covid-19, and i think we\u2019ll lose the dom\u00adestic too, unless we can arrest spread of the disease, says kapil kaul, ceo, india and middle east, centre for asia pacific aviation (capa), a market research firm. the international air transport association (iata) predicts \nlosses of $113 billion in revenues for airlines globally. the wadia group-controlled airline goair has shut down its international operations till april 15 and initiated a short-term and temporary leave without pay programme for some staff including cabin crew. indigo airlines and air india too have cancelled several international flights as has vistara. most domestic airlines will be hit hard since they have cash positions that may not last beyond a week, says kaul. the drop in the number of travellers is also affecting city cabs. in karnataka, there has been a 50 per cent drop in the demand for daily rides, especially in bengaluru. around 80 per cent of private buses and taxis in the state are standing idle, according to the karnataka state travel operators\u2019 association. hotels, too, are seeing cancellations of bookings, as events are cancelled or postponed. in delhi and mumbai, malls, multiplexes and auditoriums have been shut down under government orders. the federation of the karnataka chambers of commerce & industry estimates a rs 2,000 crore loss for business in the state as over 50 malls, 55 multiplexes, 600 single-screen theatres, over 100 supermarkets, pubs and some 150 small-scale units have been shut down. meat and poultry is another segment being savaged. rumours of animal to human spread of the disease resulted in a 70 per cent drop in sales in karnataka. chicken prices too crashed, according to the karnataka poultry farmers & breeders association. in west

for the infection and 2,528 people put under home quarantine. ninetythree people are in isolation wards in various hospitals according to the latest figures. key players in the field have claimed that

domestic and 8 per cent in foreign tourist arrivals. in the first nine months of 2019, (january to september) domestic visitors to the southern state touched 16.48 per cent against 4.8 per cent in the

by the hartals or strikes even as the government had claimed that the protests will not affect the tourism sector. \"earlier hartals used to affect our industry. even now, the situation is not different. sabarimala protests, two consecutive floods and landslides in wayanad, nipah, anti-caa protests and now this coronavirus. all are directly affecting the tourism industry. the inflow of

Almost two dozen the deadly victims confirmed from the new coronavirus detected in December in China. It is estimated that the number of infected is in more than four thousand and the international community takes steps to prevent the epidemic from becoming a pandemic. Portugal already has three hospitals in prevention, two in Lisbon (Curry Cabral and Estefania) and one in Porto (S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o). It will be in these units, in principle, that will be hospitalized any people in which the virus is detected. A relatively remote hypothesis, but not inconceivable. The original outbreak began in a seafood and animal market in Wuhan, a Chinese city of 11 million inhabitants. It is not yet known the animal that gave him rise, although the initial investigations seem to point to snakes and bats. The express spoke with Celso Cunha, director of the Medical Microbiology Unit of the Institute of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine at the New University of Lisbon, to better understand the size of the problem. What is the real risk at this time in Portugal? Real risk to the countries of Europe at this time is considered low. In Portugal as well. There are some European airports that have direct flights to Wuhan, the region where the virus was detected. Heathrow, Charles de Gaulle, Rome, Istanbul and also Moscow, except for error. Apparently, there has not yet been in Europe any case from people traveling to this region. However, it is necessary, in my opinion, to keep the alert for trips not only for China but also for the other countries where confirmed cases have also been detected: Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Macau, namely. When a traveler arrives from Wuhan, what happens on the five airports he mentioned? Is the person tested? At this moment, no, as much as I know. In the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom is being considered the implementation of measurements at airports - some travelers screening that come from these areas - but I still do not know exactly what will be implemented. I know that the measures are being considered seriously, both more than in the United States has already been detected a case. What kind of measures are spoken, and how would people else be? would those who present those symptoms that have been described, such as fever or difficulties in breathing? Someone who travel on the plane with these symptoms and that on arrival the manifests. When the SARS epidemic occurred, in which there was also a coronavirus in China that initially provoked an outbreak, which became an epidemic and then in a pandemic, there were about nine thousand cases and a few eight hundred, nine hundred - almost ten percent mortality. At that time, measures have been implemented that have been sorting from people with symptoms of some fever and a malaise compatible with a diagnosis of coronavirus. It is evident that most people who \nThey come with these symptoms are probably not infected with any coronavirus, but with another virus or with a bacterium that also causes such symptoms, similar to those of the flu virus. dependent on their severity, prior sorting may or may not be advisable. And if the person is infected, refer it to health services. Does this get up at the airport? At the airport it is not easy to make the diagnosis. You can eventually have specialized personnel who can detect a suspicion. But the diagnosis does not. How is the diagnosis done? It can be done through a harvest of the nasal discharge. From there, the virus genome can be extracted. In this case, a genome composed of an RNA molecule, not DNA. It is a slightly different nucleic acid from the DNA that is part of the genetic heritage of our cells. Although we also have Arn hills in our body, but with other functions. The genetic information of these viruses is contained in this Molecule of RNA, which is slightly different from DNA. What is done in the diagnosis is to amplify this RNA by a reaction similar to what is done to amplify the DNA, to detect it. Once Chinese scientists have already published the complete sequence of this coronavirus, it was possible to develop a test based on this PCR sequence, or polymerase chain reaction. With specific reagents, we can amplify only what interests us; In case, the virus genome. If we can amplify it, we have a positive result. This test can not be done at the airport. It has to be done in a laboratory. It does not take too long, no more than four, five hours. Is the test available worldwide? Yes. Not commercially, but there are already lines of the orientation of the European Center for Disease Control and the American CDC that indicate the protocol to be used. Therefore, in Portugal there are already a means to arise a suspicious case, to take this test. absolutely. Any medianally equipped diagnostic laboratory is enabled to take the test. Those two viruses that one has been said a lot ago, SARS and MERS, had no cases detected in Portugal as much as I know, there were no such cases in Portugal. I may be wrong. which has been reported, there was no. And many people have a certain idea that these distinct diseases do not arrive here come, arrive. As ours reach other sites. People travel ... Remember the Asian flu in the last century. In two years, it spread from Asia to the whole world and killed tens of millions of people. There was also the Spanish flu in 1918. At a time when there were no means of transporting today, a hundred million people died all over the world in two years. Speaking of SARS and MERS, why was there no cases in Portugal? Was it a matter of luck or statistics? It was probably thanks to the taking of very fast preventive measures, which in other cases were not taken. contrast, \nIn 1918 he did not even know that it was a virus. Public health measures will not have been the most appropriate. The new virus, as much as it is known, is less serious than the other two of which we have spoken. So far, yes. We are 17 dead and five hundred and such confirmed cases. Made the accounts are four percent of mortality. a high rate, for a respiratory infection. Well I know that the dead have been mainly older people - the oldest with 89, the newest with 48 - and with other type of complications, namely diabetes, hypertension, parkinson, liver cirrhosis, other associated pathologies. These people were more vulnerable and were the first victims. Healthy, young people, are more likely to survive and this pass with light symptoms, as if it were a vulgar flu.

since mar 9. venice is just outside of the lombardy region, which is the hardest hit area in the country. \n   \n this is a rare sight in the unesco heritage site that has been battling overtourism

bathe in the waters of the canals.\u201d \n local authorities have clarified that this does not mean that water quality has improved \u2014 sediments are still present in the waters, but are staying at the bottom. \u201cit's because there is less boat traffic that usually brings sediment to the top of the water's surface,\u201d a spokesman had told cnn. \n   \n but there\u2019s still an upside to this: air quality in venice has indeed improved. new satellite data shows that nitrogen dioxide emissions in italy have drastically decreased, especially in the northern part of the country. this is good news for venice. after all, the unesco world heritage site has been battling with overtourism, and last november, its worst floods since 1966, caused by climate change. \n air pollution in china, the epicentre of the outbreak, has also fallen drastically between january and february, as chinese cities shuttered businesses and went into lockdown and social isolation. satellite images from nasa and the european space agency (esa) show that there\u2019s been a significant reduction in nitrogen dioxide in the air, emitted by motor vehicles, power plants and industrial facilities. the improvement in air quality corresponds to the slowdown in human activities in the country.  \n not far away in hongkong, air pollution has been cut by one-third from january to february, according to studies by the hong kong university school of public health. in busy areas such as mongkok, causeway bay and central, pm2.5 particle pollutants reduced by 32 per cent. this has a direct correlation to

"china stages clinical trial blitz in search of coronavirus cure. beijing (bloomberg) - china is rushing a flurry of patient studies to identify the most effective life-saving treatments for people sickened by the coronavirus.   some 77 clinical trials targeting the pneumonia-causing virus have been registered in china since jan 23, according to data compiled by bloomberg.   the disease, known as covid-19, has infected at least 48,000 people, killing more than 1,300, mostly in china, since it emerged in the city of wuhan in late 2019 and spread to two dozen countries.   the trials range from the high-profile study of gilead sciences inc's experimental antiviral drug remdesivir and abbvie inc's hiv pill kaletra, to tests of traditional chinese herbal medicines and whether the sport of shadowboxing may aid recovery.   while the sheer size of the research effort is noteworthy, the ability to scientifically and methodically discern ways to treat and prevent infections caused by a pathogen in the middle of an outbreak is unprecedented.   \"the role that research can play is often very contentious, whether we need to respond to an outbreak or whether we can actually take the time to research interventions,\" said dr anne schuchat, principal deputy director of the us centres for disease control and prevention. \"it's really important for us to be able to do both.   \"the pace of research can keep up sometimes and really needs to be not an afterthought, because we don't know how long some of these new emerging infections will persist,\" she said, noting that scientific accuracy and research quality remain critical.   much of the research effort has been guided by the world health organisation's r&d blueprint that enables the rapid activation of research studies during epidemics.   chinese regulators have been streamlining bureaucracies to cut the time it takes to approve drug trials and win approvals, ensuring that patients can get cutting-edge medicines fast and, in some cases, even before patients in developed countries.   \"optimistically, some of the trials could have an early readout in three to four weeks,\" said dr ding sheng, dean of tsinghua university's school of pharmaceutical sciences. if trials meet their key objectives, \"conditional approval could be considered, given the current outbreak situation\", he said.   some studies, including the one testing remdesivir, require regulatory approval from the national medical products administration, while others are initiated by doctors and can proceed after hospital ethics committees have given their consent.   it is important to start studies while the virus is circulating widely so researchers can determine relatively quickly which medicines are most effective.   the large number of patients being diagnosed means that studies may be conducted fast, with full enrollment of antiviral drug trials occurring in just six months, said dr soumya swaminathan, the who's chief scientist.   efforts to develop drugs \nfor ebola and the coronaviruses that caused sars and mers ran into difficulty because of waning cases. complicating the process is the potential that an outbreak may abate before a vaccine or treatment is ready for use, diminishing its value.   gilead's experimental drug remdesivir, which was developed to fight ebola, but has shown some signs of potency against sars and mers, is being tested at a hospital in wuhan after a coronavirus patient getting it in the us appeared to respond.   some 761 patients are expected to be enrolled in the trial, 66 per cent of whom will be dosed with the drug. the remainder will receive standard treatment and placebo, according to state-run news agency xinhua.   while the drug's effectiveness against the new coronavirus is still being investigated, scientists in china who tested it in labs filed an application to patent its use against the coronavirus as early as jan 21. the move was seen as an effort by china to gain some bargaining power as it negotiates licence fees with gilead in the event that clinical trials prove remdesivir works in patients.   china's national health commission recommends abbvie's kaletra be used as part of antiviral treatment for covid-19 cases even while it plans to study the efficacy of the hiv medicine alongside antivirals such as roche holding ag's xofluza, and avigan, an anti-influenza medication developed by fujifilm holdings corp and toyama chemical co.   traditional chinese remedies are also being explored for their virus-fighting potential.   guangdong province traditional chinese medicine hospital is conducting observational studies to check the efficacy of two different concoctions of chinese herbal medicines: one for infected patients and the other for those suspected of having the infection, said dr liu yuntao, who applied to conduct the trials. further studies may be done if they appear to be effective, she said.   it's important to ensure clinical studies are of high quality and generate meaningful results, who's dr swaminathan said.   \"as long as the studies are done well, well-designed to give the right answer, there may be products which can be tested as adjunct therapies, for example, along with anti-retrovirals,\" she said. \"i would like to see that they're tested in good clinical trial protocols.\"   guangdong's drug regulator approved the use of an herbal medicine, dubbed \"pneumonia formula 1\", across 30 hospitals. it was designated for treating pneumonia caused by the virus after more than half of the 50

there are now at least four patients with no recent travel history to china or links to the other cases.      a teacher was among the three new cases announced, while one of the cases went visiting during chinese new year after developing symptoms, said moh.   health minister gan kim yong said that authorities are now expanding their case definition and doing \"proactive case finding\".   \"this

easily from person to person, but has not spread widely and is being contained. moderate disruption is expected, due to measures such as quarantine and visitor restrictions at hospitals.      seventeen of the 33 confirmed patients in singapore were visitors from china, while another four are singaporeans who were evacuated from wuhan on jan 30.      twelve are locally transmitted, of which nine can be traced back to a group of chinese tourists from guangxi.   two patients are now in critical condition, said moh. they are on breathing support and do not have any other significant medical problems, said\u00a0moh director of medical services kenneth mak.      two patients have been discharged, while the remaining cases are stable or improving. the second discharged patient is a woman from wuhan who was the second confirmed case in singapore.   mr mak said that\u00a0experts around the world are working towards understanding the nature of the new coronavirus and its transmission patterns.   \"all of us still recognise that the main form of spread remains by droplets and\u00a0it is very important for us to recognise that most spread can occur through touch,\" he said.

(reuters) - a washington state man in his 50s with underlying health issues became the united states\u2019 first fatality from the coronavirus, officials said on saturday, as the trump administration stepped up efforts to combat the spread of the global outbreak. the patient, who was chronically ill prior to contracting covid-19, died at evergreenhealth hospital in kirkland, near seattle, and officials are unsure how he was exposed to the virus, said jeffrey duchin, head of the washington health department\u2019s communicable disease unit. the state has recorded two other \u201cpresumptive\u201d coronavirus cases at a long-term care facility in kirkland where more than 50 residents and staff could be showing symptoms, he said. \u201cat this point we do not have

were a health care worker in her 40s who is in satisfactory condition, and a woman in her 70s who lived there and is in serious condition. \u201cit is a sad day as we learn a washingtonian has died from covid-19. our hearts go out to his family and friends,\u201d the state\u2019s governor, jay inslee, said in a statement. \u201cwe are strengthening our preparedness and response efforts to keep washingtonians healthy, safe and informed.\u201d the first u.s. coronavirus death capped a week of stock market upheaval and escalating concern among state and federal health officials as the virus has spread across 46 countries and infected more than 60 people in the united states. house speaker nancy pelosi said lawmakers would take up a coronavirus spending bill next week \u201cto advance a strong emergency funding supplemental package that fully addresses the scale and seriousness of this public health crisis\u201d. most of the u.s. cases have occurred in travelers who were repatriated from china, where the virus originated. but public health officials have also identified coronavirus cases in california, washington and oregon with no direct ties to the virus\u2019 source in china, signaling a turning point in strategies needed to contain the disease in the united states. u.s. health authorities say it means the respiratory disease that has infected nearly 80,000 people worldwide and killed more than 2,800 in china is no longer an imported phenomenon but has taken up residence in the united states. graphic: tracking the novel coronavirus - here \u201cwe still judge the general risk to the american public to be low and that includes residents of long-term care facilities,\u201d nancy messonier, head of the immunization and respiratory disease division at the centers for disease control (cdc), told reporters in a call on saturday. messonnier said the agency would send teams to support investigations in california and washington into how patients contracted the virus and help trace who else may have been exposed. \nreuters graphics on the new coronavirus: here person-to-person transmission until this week, the cdc had counted just 15 confirmed cases in six states as having been detected through the u.s. public health system since jan. 21. most were contracted by individuals while traveling in china. only two person-to-person transmissions were documented among them, both between married couples. an additional 47 cases have been confirmed among people recently repatriated, either from the diamond princess cruise ship quarantined in japan or from the chinese city of wuhan, the supposed epicenter of the outbreak, according to the cdc. health officials said the advent of locally transmitted infections means authorities need to expand their focus from detecting a relatively limited number of cases, identifying close contacts and isolating them, to one that also emphasizes greater prevention among the public at large. in particular, individuals should be more vigilant about basic hygiene measures, such as washing hands often, avoiding touching their faces, covering coughs and sneezes and staying home from school or work whenever ill, health officials say. coronavirus is spread primarily through tiny droplets coughed or sneezed directly from an infected person into the face of someone nearby, as opposed to the more contagious \u201cairborne\u201d transmission of a virus like measles, which can remain suspended in enclosed spaces and be breathed in hours after being exhaled by sick individuals, experts say. coronavirus can also survive on surfaces, such as handrails and door knobs, for \u201ca very long period of time,\u201d and be picked up by hand that way, though the virus is \u201cvery susceptible\u201d to cleaning

links coronavirus outbreak in 2 us states with genetic fingerprints. a u.s. scientist is helping public health authorities understand and track the coronavirus, turning up clues about how it arrived and spread through washington state and beyond, including potentially seeding an outbreak on the grand princess cruise ship.\nwashington's governor banned large public events in three counties on wednesday, a strategy guided by the work of trevor bedford and his colleagues, who have estimated there are currently 1,100 active cases in the state, most of them undiscovered by testing.\nlike a detective studying fingerprints, bedford uses the genetic code the virus leaves behind. the dots he connects are mutations in the genetic alphabet of the virus, a 30,000-letter string that changes at the rate of one letter every 15 days.\nthose tiny mutations don't change the virus' effect on people, but they do allow scientists to draw conclusions about how it spreads from person to person.\nafter a person gets tested for the virus with nasal and throat swabs, a small bit of the specimen can be used to rapidly sequence the virus' genome. that work has been happening, not just in seattle, but in other labs around the world. scientists are sharing their results on a public platform where they've been sharing influenza genome data since 2008.\nthis week, bedford's lab at the fred hutchinson cancer research center worked with california researchers to find links between a cluster of cases in the seattle area and the outbreak on the grand princess cruise ship in california.\n\"they all are very similar genetically,\" bedford told the associated press. \"it seems very possible\" that virus from the washington outbreak made it onto the grand princess.\ndr. charles chiu at the university of california, san francisco, agreed. he provided genome sequencing of seven samples from infected passengers who got off the grand princess this week. an eighth sample from an earlier grand princess cruise to mexico had ties to washington state, chiu said, and that person likely seeded the outbreak among passengers on board as the ship left for hawaii.\n\"the simplest explanation,\" chiu said, is that the earlier grand princess passenger had been in washington state and then seeded the cruise ship outbreak.\nthere's an alternative explanation, chiu said. a cruise passenger or crew member was infected in another country, coincidentally by a virus with the same mutations as the washington state cases.\n\"common sense tells you it more likely came from washington,\" chiu said.\nfor most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. the vast majority of people recover within a few weeks.\nbased on genome sequencing of 18 washington state cases, bedford believes the state outbreak began with one person, perhaps the 35-year-old man who was the first known u.s. case. the coronavirus infection rate in the seattle flu study, a project mapping seasonal flu, indicates there could be 1,100 active covid-19 infections in the state, although because of limitations in the modeling that number could range from as low as 210 to as high as 2,800 active infections.\nhealth authorities tried to trace all the people who had contact with the first u.s. case, a resident of snohomish county, north of seattle, who had visited wuhan, the chinese city that was the initial epicenter of the outbreak. he landed at seattle-tacoma international airport on jan. 15 and started feeling sick the next day. on jan. 19, he visited a clinic in and was hospitalized on jan. 20.\n\"they did very aggressive contact tracing looking to identify anybody who had had contact with that initial case and sort of concentric circles outward,\" dr. nancy messonnier of the centers for disease control and prevention said wednesday. she called bedford's work \"an interesting hypothesis,\" but said the outbreak could have been caused by \"a secondary seeding.\"\nkristian andersen, a genetic epidemiologist at scripps research in la jolla, california, agreed that the virus was introduced to washington state by one person and suggested that the active cases probably exceed 1,100. neither of the conclusions bedford described is a surprise, he said in an email.\n\"the united states has completely failed to prepare for the pandemic despite having adequate time and we currently have one of the lowest capacity for covid-19 testing,\" he wrote. \"this continues to be an enormous problem and it is highly likely that we are currently be missing the vast majority of cases occurring across the country.\"\n\"unless our ability to detect cases is transformed within days and aggressive strategies for responses are put in place, within a couple of weeks, we are going to find ourselves in a situation that is very similar to the one currently unfolding in italy,\" andersen wrote.

If they arrive with this fear, they will have facilities to welcome them with comfort and tranquility, \"justifies Grace Freitas. But national citizens will not be \"prisoners\", ensures. Without specifying whether this isolation space will be located in hospitals, Director General makes a point of stressing that \"the likelihood of them infected is tiny\", because they have been in a kind of \"forced quarantine\" in Wuhan, City of 11 million inhabitants whose borders areas, rail and terrestrial areas were closed by the Chinese government in an attempt to contain the outbreak of the new coronavirus. There will be 17 citizens to be taken from Wuhan, according to Lu\u00eds Estanislau, one of the Portuguese retained there, which asserts that the environment in the group is \"SuperCalmo\". The arrival of the Portuguese to Mature Fig Airport (Lisbon), second knew the public, is scheduled for Saturday morning, but officially the government did not want to advance details about the repatriation operation, claiming that it is very complex and must be surrounded by absolute discretion. It should not be, however, because of these Portuguese that coronavirus will spread in the country. Waiting for these passengers will start and arriving teams of health professionals who will track them. If they present symptoms of infection on arrival, the three benchmarks in Portugal to welcome these cases, Curry Cabral and D. Estefania (in Lisbon) and the s. John (in Porto), will have insulation rooms with negative pressure (with ventilation system that does not allow air to leave) where they can remain until they perceive whether or not they are sick, after analyzes made at the Health Institute Ricardo Jorge. Internment in these hospitals is reserved only for people with suspected infection or already sick. Thursday morning, still awaiting instructions from the Directorate-General for Health (DGS), the Director of the Infectious Disease Service at Hospital Curry Cabral, Fernando Maltez, emphasized that there were no reason for worries, at least for now. If there is any case suspected of infection by the new coronavirus in the community, \"naturally will be hospitalized\", this is what is provided in standards and protocols, recalls. That was what happened, already with a suspicious case that eventually revealed negative. The circuits mounted to respond to suspected cases of contagion with the new coronavirus are not even \nnew. \"We had already been activated with SARS [severe acute respiratory syndrome] in 2003 and 2004, with influenza A in 2009, with Ebola in 2014 and 2015. and are periodically reviewed and updated according to the pathology concerned. Of course there are aspects that are varying, \"explains Fernando Maltez. Subscribe newsletters for free and receive the best of the publicity and the deepest jobs of the public. With 14 negative pressure rooms, some of which occupied with patients with other pathologies such as tuberculosis, in the Curry Cabral will still be possible to \"isolate and close a pavilion\", if this proves necessary, adds the doctor. But nothing indicates, for now, that it will come to this phase, he says. in Porto, the hospital of s. John has the ability to put in negative pressure rooms simultaneously 15 people, although not all in single rooms, reveals Carlos Lima Alves, coordinator of the Infection Prevention and Control Unit, which also emphasizes that internal circuits for response to threats of this type already existed and were now adapted. In this \"still initial phase and where there is much ignorance\", the resources will be mobilized according to the needs. \"DGS will climb the type of intervention measures necessary and we will have to accompany the process, recruiting more resources,\" he says. But this is just a small part of the response thought to the case of the situation to complicate and begin to appear many suspicious cases and many patients. The doctor establishes, on the subject, parallel with prevention and training to fight forest fires to illustrate the need to keep these circuits always well oiled. \"It's a bit as with the fires. We need to have mobilization capacity, a greater standby state to ensure a muscular response [in case of crisis]. And this requires a continuous effort to exercise the ability to answer such threats, even if this effort is not always monetized, \"he says.

The pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019-ncov virus is \"important\", but it is not a global urgency. This is the conclusion that the Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization (WHO) arrived on Thursday, which agreed that, at the moment, it will not declar a global alarm by the Wuhan Coronavirus. \"This does not mean that it can not be done at another time,\" said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreysus, general director of the organism.\nIt was the second day of meetings and the decision was not unanimous. The Committee was divided: Half of the 16 experts asked to take this exceptional measure, and the other half was contrary. \"Given the number of cases [more than 600] and its severity [18 deaths], with a limited number of infections outside of China and considering the efforts of the authorities of this country to contain the virus, we have decided that it is too early\" , he assured at a retransmitted press conference from Geneva Didier Houssin, the president of the Emergency Committee, who also tied that WHO is prepared to change his mind in the coming days if the situation requires it.\nHoussin recalled that declaring the world alert is a historical fact for an epidemic that can have an impact on the affected countries. Previously, WHO took this measure in just five occasions: before the H1N1 flu outbreak (2009), Ebola in West Africa (2014) and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (2019), Polio in 2014 and the of Zika virus in 2016.\nThe international emergency is a measure intended to contain the expansion of a disease. According to the type of pathogen, its characteristics and its evolution, certain measures are taken. In the case of polio, for example, a well-known disease, the main recommendation of WHO was to ensure that all residents or who are going to reside in Iraq (sprout focus) received a dose of oral or intruscular vaccine against the polio. The idea was to prevent travelers from becoming virus transmitters. The traffic restriction, both people and merchandise, is another possible measures. Something that, Ghebreyesus underlined, is not recommended today in China, beyond the measures that have decreed the local authorities, which took on its own initiative, not by WHO advice.\nThe two most similar diseases known are SARS (acute and severe respiratory syndrome) and MERS (the Middle East respiratory syndrome, in English). The first arose also in China, in 2002. On this occasion there were about 8,000 infected, of which approximately 10% died. The Mers emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and died 35% of those affected.

Dracula's companion, blood-absorbing night owls and now even dangerous virus spells, the blame should be at the coronavirus outbreak in China. The image of the bats has gotten another knack than gene analyzes of the new pathogen with the provisional name 2019-NCOV revealed: It is 88 percent related to a virus that bypasses under horseshoe noses (The Lancet: Lu et al. 2020). Bats, flyers and their relatives are particularly popular animals in Germany. Numerous people have been committed for decades to protect the 25 species domiciled with us, of which just under a third is considered threatened or threatened by extinction. Not only since the current Coronaviren epidemic, bates are held responsible if a pathogen from the animal world makes a wide range of people. Batids are considered popular reservoirs for viruses, which means: the viruses dune in them and wait for their chance to spread across type borders. As the Middle Eastern Airway Syndrome (MERS-COV) caused by a coronavirus (Mers-COV) broke out for the first time on the Arabian peninsula in 2012 for the first time, it was dromedare that had transferred the new pathogens to humans. But bats had accused the camels. The NiPah virus, which was in 1991 for the first time pork farmers in Malaysia, can be traced back on flanks: The farmers infected themselves with their pigs, which in turn had eaten fruits where feces and urine glued by airshowns. Exactly this interaction of different animal species as a host of viruses splits the scientists in at least two camps: one emphasizing that the viruses originally emanated from bats. The others focus on the fact that there were camels and pigs that exaggerated the diseases on humans. The polluter demand ultimately remains one of the interpretation: is the kind of polluter an epidemic that the virus originally housed? Or the one that has passed on to humans? Most viruses have hosts beyond species borders. They are constantly changing, assessing genetic care and learning new things: Thus, a pathogen that only birds only birds can obtain the ability to penetrate into human cells by mutations - such animal disease becomes a disease for people. If that happens, scientists speak of a zoonosis. The further humanity penetrates in the habitat of animals, the higher the probability that new zoonoses arise. People Roden forests, hunting and eating wildlife or looking as tourists the adventure in the wilderness. Much more likely to come into contact with infected animals - and stuck themselves to them. Similarly, on a wildlife market in Wuhan, the epidemic could also with the new \nCoronavirus started starting. When the genome of the new pathogen was sequenced a few weeks after the outbreak, it turned out: It equates to 88 percent of the two coronavirus species that could be found in 2018 for the first time in bats. \"It is clear that this pathogen is originally from the bat,\" says Jonas Schmidt-Chanasite, virologist at the Bernhard-Steint-Institut for Tropical Medicine. \"That the virus could have come from a bat at any time, I do not want to deny,\" says the renowned bat researcher Paul Racey from the University of Aberdeen in Scotland. But he is a representative of the second researcher fraction, which appears much more relevant a very different question: Which species has transferred the new virus ultimately to humans? Batids are an order of mammals that divide into the classic system in the subordinations of the airfishes (Megachiroptera) and the bats (microchiroptera). However, the latest gene analyzes have shown that the horseshelf nose-like narrow with air dogs attributed to the bats attributed to the bats. Therefore, zoologists today distinguish the bats from a new subordination, the yinpterochiroptera: To which in turn are then ranking dogs and horseshoe-like (rhinolophoidea). Bats are usually nachective and can orient themselves spatially by ultrasound. Most bats are smaller than flyers and feed them predominantly of insects. Flights are called so because their head resembles the one dog. They predominantly occur in the tropics and subtropes and feed themselves there above all from fruits or fruit nectar. In contrast to bats, flyers usually orient themselves visually and not through echal waves. Horseshoe-like owes their name to a small skin lobe between upper lip and forehead, which is shaped like a horseshoe. They feed themselves as the bats, predominantly of insects. Batids are suspected of being the natural host of various viruses that may also make people sick: Ebola, Nipah, Hendra and Marburg and the Middle Eastern Airway Syndrome (MERS) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In addition, researchers found similarities between the new coronavirus 2019-NCOV and two virus strands that occur in bats. For Racey, a clear proof that the pathogen has jumped directly from a bat or a flying dog to humans, first provided when researchers could prove in a bat, that there are 2019-NCOV directly, the virus really spreads . There is not this proof so far. The fact that two virus strands are similar in their genome, the bat researchers are not enough to give the batings with their more than 1,400 known species the sole blame to a new outbreak. They form the most advanced after the rodents \nOrder of mammals - and often targeted their great spread. According to Racey, it can be good that the new coronavirus has jumped over from a bat to another animal from a bat. This intermediary could then have passed on to humans, for example, on the wildlife and fish market in Wuhan. Which species that could be that is still unclear. \"We do not know which animals there was on the market,\" says Racey. Even virologist Schmidt-Chanasit does not exclude that there was an intermediate host, so animal species between bat and man. But for him is clear: The bat is the place of origin of the new coronavirus. And who is the unknown intermediate host, it is just shedged intensively. But that's how the zoologists are criticized: that at all zoonoses are always researched until the bat at the origin of the infection chain startup. That is why not all the potential species who carry viruses would be equally intensively studied, says Merlin Tuttle, bat protectors and zoologist from the USA. Bats are easy to catch, the white Tuttle from our own experience: you make a trap in front of the entrance of a cave and wait for the animals to fly. \"It would be much harder, thirty cobra to catch as thirty bats,\" says the researcher. The virologist Schmidt-Chanasite understands the argument, but says, you can argue the whole thing in the other direction: \"If you would catch even more bats, you might find a virus that matches 99 percent with the new coronavirus.\" Whether Nipah, SARS or MERS: bats are considered original stove for many viruses that may affect humans (trends in microbiology: Brook & Dobson, 2015). Often they carry the pathogens in the body without suffering themselves. Why that is, there are different theories: many have something to do with it to consume extremely much energy while flying, which could also affect your immune system. It could lead to different ways, for example, that your body defense viruses are not fought with full force, but tolerated them. That would also explain why the animals do not even ill themselves who can pass the pathogens (Emerging Infectious Diseases: O'Shea et al., 2014). But the exact mechanism is not yet clarified. Of course, at least that bats and flyers are \"an incredibly species-rich mammal group\", Fabian Lendertz, who researches the Robert Koch Institute for epidemiology of pathogenic microorganisms. And the more species there are, the higher the likelihood that the animals are a greater variety of microbes. In addition, there are also very large bat populations that are a perfect reservoir for viruses. Single types of airshots or bats do not necessarily have to be vulnerable than other animals. your \nHowever, they may make way of frequent transducers. Researchers and researchers from the EcoHealth Alliance, a private research institution in New York, examined 754 mammal species and found that a total of more zoonotic viruses harvest more zoonotic viruses than any other type examined (Nature: Olival et al., 2017). Intermediate host or here: blame for the distribution of the viruses is the bat anyway not. Because nature does not know the principle of guilt. You consider to be a polluter, may be correct according to the principle of causality, but it is too short. Instead of pointing with the finger to animals, the people should rethink their own behavior towards wild animals with every new among humans. The poaching plays a major role in transferring viruses of animals to humans. But many zoonotic outbreaks would not even be that people hunt big wildlife like monkeys in the jungle, says Laptz. Instead, go to so-called Cultural Supers, for example, on rats, bats and flights of flights, which are close to human dwellings. At the same time, it is difficult to condemn such hunting practices a flat rate: Hunting is an ancient tradition in many regions and is considered important food source. A problem is also the markets where people buy and sell wildlife. There, dead and living animals are offered in the narrowest room, people push through the small streets, everything mixes and mixes: a perfect place for a virus to spread quickly. At the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities of the World Health Organization WHO reported an accumulation of pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause in the Central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the diseases. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days then a group released a group of the virologen Christian's premier from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 the first diagnostic test for the new virus, the researcher provisionally call 2019-NCOV. With the test, the virus can be detected in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, on which, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected. Both the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as well as Mers (MIDDLE East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses which have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more than 750 died. With the MERS virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronaviruses. many of \nThey relate to the respiratory tract and can cause climbs, for example. In China, several thousand persons are suffering from them, some of them - most of them with pre-existing conditions - have died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first infection cases outside of China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been in Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection with a tourist, who came back from Wuhan, on January 24, the first cases were known in France. Meanwhile, first cases were confirmed in Germany. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. The virus can cause pneumonia that can endally end. Since it is a viral illness, antibiotics do not help. Meanwhile, it is clear that the virus can be transferred from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transfers after a dozen cases were known in medical staff. Medizors assume that the virus is transmitted above all over droplet infection. The World Health Organization calculates, as announced on January 24, at the moment that an infected one cuts 1.4 to 2.5 other people. Contest these numbers, the virus is less contagious than SARS and also the viral flu. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals. That can not be said yet. The World Health Organization said on 28 January that about one-fifth of the reported cases through the virus will be seriously ill, so in case of doubt must be treated intensive care. According to reports, the first death pots were patients who had some severe pre-existing conditions. Even with other infectious diseases, people with pre-existing diseases are particularly endangered - for example at the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so change their genome. This can cause you to become more dangerous for people in the course of an outbreak - but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) expects no similar mortality to the current time as the outbreak of SARS. Bat researchers such as Racey and Tuttle fear that a fire label of the flying dogs and bats as a virus shaft further worsens the relationship between them and humans. \"If bats are considered a pathogens for Ebola and other viruses, no one will accept a bat in his own garden,\" says Tuttle. Recently, the owner of an apartment complex called him: a bat flew into one of the apartments, the inhabitant is afraid to get infected with the animal with a disease \nto have. \"The current media reports on the connection between the coronavirus and bats have fueled the story in any case,\" says Tuttle. Even if horseshoe noses have probably played a role in the case of the new coronavirus: here in Europe, it is very unlikely that people are infected with a dangerous virus, says Christian Voigt, who researches bats in the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research . In Europe, bats could only transfer rabies. But even this danger is rather low: According to the Robert Koch Institute, the last rabies caused by a bat bite rabies death in Europe in 2002 in Scotland occurred. Throughout the discussion about the animals as a disease carrier, it is often forgotten how important they are worldwide for agriculture and nature - and what role they play worldwide for various ecosystems. Some flyers, but also a few bats, dust exactly like bees and other beneficies crops. As an insect-eater, our domestic bats of pests keep pests in chess. But not few are now threatened by extinction. In this situation, the latter protectors from the US and Europe fear that an image could also harm the animals as a virus spelling: not only, because then perhaps fewer people donate for the protection of these animals than for sweet pandas or seal babies. But also because they fear that bat animals could be systematically fought like rats or pigeons in the city. At all excitement around the origin of the new coronavirus, the world should not lose sight of global dramatic species dies. Angelmice to devote, does not protect any epidemics before.

ship amid a coronavirus scare on valentine\u2019s day, embraces were the order of the day. protective masks were not.   not only did prime minister hun sen not wear one, assured that the ship was virus-free, his bodyguards ordered people who had donned masks to take them off. the next day, the us ambassador to cambodia, mr w. patrick murphy, who brought his own family to greet the passengers streaming off the ship, also went maskless.   \u201cwe are very, very grateful that cambodia has opened literally its ports and doors to people in need,\u201d mr murphy said.   but after hundreds of passengers had disembarked, one later tested positive for the coronavirus, known as covid-19. now, health officials worry that what cambodia opened its doors to was the outbreak, and that the world may pay a price as passengers from the cruse ship westerdam stream home.   before the westerdam docked in sihanoukville, fearful governments in other countries had turned the ship away at five ports of call even though the cruise operator, holland america, assured officials that the ship\u2019s passengers had been carefully screened.   mr hun sen\u2019s decision to allow it entry appeared to be a political calculus as much as anything else. the region\u2019s longest-serving ruler and a close ally of china, he is known for his survival skills.   but mr hun sen\u2019s critics worry that the aging autocrat might have acted rashly.   \u201cof course, he had to do the dictator thing: photo op, roses, exploit this for its maximum value,\u201d said mr sophal ear, an expert in cambodian politics at occidental college. \u201cwhatever is in the best interest of cambodians is completely irrelevant to him.\u201d   it is too early to tell whether the decision to let hundreds of passengers from the westerdam fly off has the makings of an epidemiological disaster. cambodian health authorities said that 409 of the 2,257 passengers and crew had left cambodia for their homes scattered across the globe. the rest remain in hotels in phnom penh, the capital, or on the ship.   but deficiencies in screening for the coronavirus aboard the ship, along with continued complacency about the epidemic in cambodia, are raising fears this small southeast asian nation could prove to be a surprising vector of transmission for a virus that has already killed more than 1,700 people, mostly in china, the epicenter of the outbreak.   many health experts urge people who have been in contact with coronavirus patients to self-quarantine for 14 days, lest they add another spoke to the contagion network.   but on monday (feb 17), mr hun sen directed officials in phnom penh to treat passengers from the westerdam to a sightseeing jaunt.   \u201cto tour the city is better than staying in rooms or at the hotel feeling bored or scared,\u201d said a post on mr hun sen\u2019s facebook page.   the lack of urgency in cambodia, where officials \nmilled around the ship monday without protection, points to the obstacles in trying to contain a virus that experts warn is spreading faster than sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) or mers, (middle east respiratory syndrome).   \u201cthis is influenza-like transmission,\u201d said mr michael osterholm, director of the center for infectious disease research and policy at the university of minnesota. \u201cit\u2019s like trying to stop the wind.\u201d   last week, when the westerdam docked in sihanoukville, the cambodian government and the cruise operator deemed the vessel virus-free.   the declaration was at a minimum premature.   only 20 people out of the 2,257 onboard were tested for the virus before disembarking, and that was because they had reported themselves to ship medical staff with various ailments.   the woman who twice tested positive after travelling on to malaysia, an 83-year-old american, was not among those 20, holland america said.   health monitoring for the rest of the passengers was limited to a handful of temperature checks conducted with infrared thermometers, passengers said. in a statement, holland america said that during one of those screenings, not a single person on board recorded an elevated temperature.   on monday, an announcement broadcast to passengers remaining on the westerdam warned that they should avoid the ship\u2019s hot deck and return to their air-conditioned rooms to avoid falsely high temperature readings.   some health experts have questioned the efficacy of infrared thermometers, also known as temperature guns, saying they measure the heat emanating from the surface of the body, rather than core body temperature.   various environmental factors can distort thermometer gun reading, said mr gary strahan, who runs a small infrared device company in texas.   \u201cin cambodia, you have warmer background temperatures,\u201d he said. \u201cit could impact the measurement. that\u2019s the issue with any noncontact thermometer.\u201d   even if temperatures are accurately gauged, people may be taking medication that lower their temperature, like some arthritis drugs.   and in any case, people who are asymptomatic can still pass on the coronavirus, scientists have found.   \u201ca person who does not present as feverish is not necessarily uninfected with a disease or a virus,\u201d said mr jim seffrin, an expert on infrared devices at the infraspection institute in new jersey.   in the wake of the positive test in malaysia, cambodian health officials said they would be relying on a domestic lab to test all passengers and crew members still in the country for the coronavirus.   on monday evening, passengers celebrated news from cambodian health officials that a first batch of 406 people in phnom penh had tested negative, although there was no certainty they would not later test positive.   \u201cpeople on the ship are very grateful to the people of cambodia,\u201d said ms tammie graves, an american from kansas. \u201ci was a bit worried that they might be afraid of us, even at the \nhotel, but it hasn\u2019t been like that at all.\u201d   on monday afternoon, more than 100 westerdam passengers took up mr hun sen\u2019s offer of a capital tour, piling in buses to see the royal palace and other sites.   in pictures of the excursion, posted on a government-linked website, only one person can be seen wearing a mask.   despite cases of coronavirus popping up in southeast asia, hun sen has campaigned against masks, arguing that they are better at spreading fear than stopping germs. at a news conference last month, he announced that he would kick out anyone who dared wear a mask.   even as other governments instituted china travel bans that angered beijing, mr hun sen travelled to the chinese capital and met with mr xi jinping, china\u2019s leader, in another photo op.   and as other countries organised airlifts of people trapped in wuhan, the city where the virus is believed to have originated, mr hun sen said he would not ferry cambodian students home because they should be \u201cjoining with chinese to fight this disease.\u201d   the sense of solidarity makes sense in a country heavily dependent on china for its fortunes, after having turned its back on a west that was demanding progress in human rights in return for aid and investment.   a torrent of chinese cash has remade cambodia, nowhere more so than in sihanoukville, a once sleepy beach town that is now a sprawling construction site of gilded casinos and towering residential blocks. more than 90 per cent of businesses in the city are now chinese owned.   on monday, ms oeun yen, a masseuse, worried about the massages she had given three female passengers from the westerdam before the virus case was confirmed by malaysia. she was not afraid at first, she said, because the prime minister had assured people all was fine.   \u201cnow i am more concerned,\u201d she said.   in a country where mr hun sen has dissolved the biggest opposition party and political assassination is not uncommon, such mild concern is as much as many ordinary residents are willing to muster.   but there is also widespread skepticism of the government\u2019s contention that only one person in cambodia has tested positive for coronavirus, a chinese citizen who has since returned home.   \u201cthere is a natural lack of credibility and trust associated with the cambodian government,\u201d said mr ou virak, a human-rights activist and founder of the future forum, a local think tank. \u201cthis is hun sen\u2019s westerdam problem, because even if he was doing the right thing, purely as a humanitarian, he will be seen as the puppet of china instead.\u201d   on monday, mr hun sen announced yet another publicity stunt: he wants to

A few days then a group released a group of the virologen Christian's premier from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 the first diagnostic test for the new virus, the researcher provisionally call 2019-NCOV. With the test, the virus can be detected in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, on which, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected. Both the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as well as Mers (MIDDLE East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses which have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more than 750 died. With the MERS virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronaviruses. Many of them relate to respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example. In China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them - the \nMost probably with pre-conditions - died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first infection cases outside of China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been in Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection with a tourist, who came back from Wuhan, on January 24, the first cases were known in France. Meanwhile, first cases were confirmed in Germany. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. The virus can cause pneumonia that can endally end. Since it is a viral illness, antibiotics do not help. Meanwhile, it is clear that the virus can be transferred from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transfers after a dozen cases were known in medical staff. Medizors assume that the virus is transmitted above all over droplet infection. The World Health Organization calculates, as announced on January 24, at the moment that an infected one cuts 1.4 to 2.5 other people. Contest these numbers, the virus is less contagious than SARS and also the viral flu. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals. That can not be said yet. The World Health Organization said on 28 January that about one-fifth of the reported cases through the virus will be seriously ill, so in case of doubt must be treated intensive care. According to reports, the first death pots were patients who had some severe pre-existing conditions. Even with other infectious diseases, people with pre-existing diseases are particularly endangered - for example at the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so change their genome. This can cause you to become more dangerous for people in the course of an outbreak - but also to the exact opposite.

and what not. The new coronavirus spreads with a huge dynamic - despite the countermeasures of the Chinese authorities. Researchers worldwide try to close from still young development to as many properties of the pathogen as possible. What you know - and what is not: - Coronaviren: The pathogen 2019-NCOV is one of the coronaviruses - so named because they are surrounded by pink-like structures that resemble a crown. Seven representatives of this group cause respiratory diseases in humans. From three of them, it is known that they sometimes trigger heavy symptoms: In the SARS virus (severe acute respiratory system) also from China, around 8,000 cases were known in 2002/2003, about 800 people died. In 2012, the Mers virus (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) appeared in the Fort. It is less contagious, but more aggressive: from around 2500 infected until November 2019, almost 860 died - about every third. 2019-NCOV is very closely related to SARS. - Infectosity: As contagious the new virus is, so far difficult to judge. Chinese authorities assume that an an average of 1.4 to 2.5 people infected - that would be similar to SARS. \"Such numbers are extremely unreliable,\" says the virologist Christian's premier from the Berlin Charit\u00e9. Accordingly, the transfer rate depends on many factors - for example, whether people are socially active or rather stay at home. Excludes that, according to the view, the measures in China are aimed at. \"I think these measures bring something.\" Positive is that people usually become infectious only with the symptoms - in contrast to the flu, in which people are already contagious before they ill. - Aggressiveness: The new coronavirus seems to be less aggressive than SARS and MERS. By Monday, 80 from around 2800 infected - the depot of a mortality rate of 2.9 percent. However, the number should be fooled, because especially at the beginning of an outbreak, the heavy cases are more known. A mortality of three percent would be a lot after viewing. The expert assumes that even the ten percent usually stated for SARS are a much too high. \"Probably there was much more than the well-known 8000 SARS cases,\" he explains. - Symptoms: Incubation Time - the period between infection and start of symptoms - is 2 to 14 days. The pulmonary disease manifests itself by fever, dry cough, shock and shortness of breath. Because the virus infects the lower respiratory tract, affected do not have a cold. Ultimately, the symptoms are similar to those of a SARS infection. No wonder, because the new virus docks on the same receptor. The test on the virus is usually based on the analysis of sputum (ejection) and takes about two hours. - Therapy: There is no special therapy for pulmonary disease. Heavyly ill patients become symptomatic \nTreated: with fever-lowering agents, the therapy of any bacterial additional infections and sometimes mechanical ventilation. - Vaccination: A vaccine would be the best way to curb the epidemic. According to Jonas Schmidt-Chanasite from the Bernhard-Steint-Institut for Tropical Medicine, vaccine candidates are currently being tested against Mers in humans. They are - successful results assumed - at the earliest in a few months available. \"Then let yourself build up,\" says Schmidt-Chanasite. - Reservoire: The reservoirs of various coronaviras are in the animal kingdom. At MERS, camels of origin, with SARS and the new pathogen, are the reservoirs probably with bat mice. On humans, the SARS pathogens probably jumped from Schleichzatzen, which are offered in Chinese markets. Also 2019-NCOV probably expects an animal market in China. From which species the virus exceeded, is currently unknown. - Protection: For protection against this as well as other viruses, experts recommend ordinary hygiene measures: regular hand washing, disinfectants and distance to suffice. The benefits of normal breathing masks - as currently in China to see everywhere on the streets - treasures Schmidt-Chanasite and exceeds as rather low. - Forecasts: Some experts expect a long outbreak. \"We should consider that as a marathon and not as a sprint,\" said Chris Whitty, who advises the British government in health issues. \"The extent and effects of this outbreak are currently unclear because the situation is developing rapidly,\" wrote a team around Anthony Fauci from the US national health institutions (NiH) in the journal \"Jama\". By contrast, the virologist's artery can imagine that the epidemic ends similarly quickly as the SARS outbreak that has been completed quickly and completed in 2004 for completion. \"I'm inclined to think optimistic because that is a SARS-like disease.\" Take care of that outside of China so far hardly came to a redistribution. \"That's extremely encouraging.\" SARS continues to circle - but only in the animal kingdom.

how i spent my days in coronavirus isolation ward. when i took off from cairo on march 15 and was filling the health declaration form, several people asked me to 'not be honest' on it. i had a mild cough. i caught a cold on my vacation in egypt. the health declaration form we had to submit at the delhi airport asked three questions: are you suffering from any of the following? - fever (yes / no) - cough (yes / no) - respiratory problems (yes / no) i ticked 'yes' next to 'cough' on both forms. from handing over my health declaration form at the screening desk at terminal 3 of the indira gandhi international airport in delhi, to being taken to the isolation ward in safdarjung hospital as a 'coronavirus suspect', and finally being discharged... it was three days of going from shock, to denial, to despair, and acceptance. and once i accepted that i had to stay in the isolation ward come what may, it was a lot easier. i had a packet of bhelpuri to look forward to. i had decided to open it on the last day of my stay at the isolation ward, but the call announcing my discharging came so suddenly that i couldn't react. it was pure happiness. i was going home. there is not much to do in an isolation ward. but it got me back to writing about my day. the following accounts are from my stay at the safdarjung hospital. *** day 1: march 16, 2020 our connecting flight from bahrain landed in delhi at 2.20 am. we proceeded to the thermal screening. as i handed my declaration forms, the person at the counter asked me if i had a fever, body ache, shortness of breath, any other respiratory problem, if i could hear any sound while breathing in. i answered in negative to all. the person at the counter told me that i was 'case a' since i was showing symptoms of covid-19, and that i would have to be taken to an isolation ward. i was handed a hazmat suit. there was no mask in the kit so i continued with the one i was wearing. my passport was taken to immigration and then i was escorted to a chamber at the airport where a doctor, in between bursts of coughing, informed me that i was going to be kept in an isolation ward at safdarjung hospital in delhi, and that an ambulance would soon take me there. it was 4 am by the time the ambulance arrived. as i walked out to the ambulance, three people from a news channel made a video, surreptitiously, of the process. when i accosted the reporter and asked her how she could breach my privacy, she spat back, \"who are you to tell me what i should delete?\" i had to ask the security to intervene. i got into the ambulance and was driven to safdarjung hospital around 4.30 am. i was shown an isolation ward and told that a doctor would soon arrive to guide on the next steps. i came into the room and saw dirt on the floor and pigeon feathers lying around. there were cobwebs and a spider too. i waited on the sofa for an hour before walking out and asking for a cleaning of the ward. i asked for a bottle of water and soap, \nand was given a bottle of kinley and a bar of nirma soap. my ward was then cleaned and sanitised. i asked for the doctor and was told that he was attending to a patient on another floor and would see me as soon as he was done there. it was 6 am. i also asked if i would be given a hospital gown. the ward boy asked me to change into my own clothes. i asked for a blanket or bedsheet; something to cover myself with because it's chilly. i was told they don't have anything. after 10/15 minutes of discussion, the hospital handed me a disposable bedsheet. at 6.30 am, a doctor came visiting. he asked me for symptoms and i repeated what i'd told at the airport: a cough. he seemed a little surprised that i was brought to an isolation ward because of just a cough, but apparently the guidelines are strict. he asked me for travel history to any of the covid-19 affected countries on the government list. i said no. then he said that my samples would be taken for testing. the results will arrive in 2 or 3 days, and till then, i would have to stay in this isolation ward. i got a call two hours ago, checking if my samples had been taken for a test. it is 9 am, and my samples still have not been taken for a test. my passport is with the hospital. if people are not declaring symptoms, they have a damn good reason to not do so. *** day 2: march 17, 2020 when you are thrown in a situation like this, your body recoils before reacting. mine did too. but in india, if you have grown up with a messed up healthcare system, you know when to be grateful. at this isolation ward of delhi's safdarjung hospital, i have got an ocean of gratefulness for these healthcare warriors. i saw about five people yesterday. only their eyes from behind their special glasses. they are all dressed in hazmat suits so it is difficult to tell who's who. but i recognise their voices and the eyes. it's all in the eyes. my samples were taken yesterday for the test. they have to find out if the virus is in my system. i can go home if the test says negative. it will probably be another 15 days in this room if the test says otherwise. the world is at war. all of us who thought the third world war will be fought with nuclear weapons, starting somewhere off the south china sea, were wrong about it. yes, this war did start in china, but mainland wuhan. the virus got out of china and took over the world. the world is now fighting its third great war, and at its forefront are these warriors, dressed in their hazmat suits, leaving no stone unturned in nursing people back to health. at the airport when i got into that suit, i knew it wasn't going to be easy. if you've been healthy all of the 30 years of your existence and have avoided doctors unless for a ligament tear or an eye injury, you are wary of hospitals. in my mind, i am healthy. the doctor at the airport also told me that even if i am carrying the virus, and that's a big if, i was going to make a full recovery. the virus won't affect me. but i would \nneed to be isolated till they are sure. it is a delicate time. we as a people cannot go wrong anymore. i have been seeing story after tragic story from italy, where the death toll has been piling up like rubble after an earthquake; in france, where it's 15 days of a nationwide lockdown now; to south korea, where the number of recoveries are now trumping the number of deaths. this is a pandemic. and we are bang in the heart of it. in india, we are just about a week away from where italy is now. youth has that strange vanity about itself. when you're healthy, you think it's just a cough. you don't want to keep yourself away from people because we want company. social distancing seems too harsh a concept for our social-media revolutionaries, where every fleeting moment is instagrammed and every stray thought tweeted. our immunity is strong, we think. maybe. none of us wants to plague ourselves with ideas like social responsibility. they are all ideas after all, right? i stay alone, i told the airport officials at the health desk. so anyway i've been following social distancing. my office has asked us to work from home and not get out at all. it is not enough, the person at the desk said, you will need to go through the isolation ward. as i look at these men and women tending to people in the rooms in this isolation ward, i feel happy that i chose to declare that cough on my health form. if there is even one per cent chance of limiting this contagion, i will do my bit. being isolated is not easy. i mean i live alone, so isolation is not a stange concept that way. but i can't get out of this room. i haven't seen a face but from within a hazmat suit for more than a day now. it can play with your head. but in this room on the seventh floor of the isolation ward, at least there's a large window to throw that bitter gourd out of. *** it's a bright sunny morning. outside the glass window on this floor, a family of pigeons go about their business, flapping their wings, cooing and flying around. no one has asked them to follow the protocols of social distancing. there is nothing called isolation in their world. there is no concern of covid-19 either. looking at these birds, the wright brothers drew up the sketch of the first aircraft. it was these birds that made icarus take off with his pair of wings. since that first flight, humankind has always looked up at the sky. all of us who did not grow up with airplanes, remember the thrill of that first flight. once you've seen that slice of sky through your window, you want to return to the clouds. could we ever anticipate that flying would mean putting all of the world at risk? this little microorganism has made us all take a long hard look at what we really need to live. with our wings clipped, our hubris tamed, we now go back to looking at the birds and waiting for that next flight. i have spent two days in this room. i'm at an isolation ward at safdarjung hospital in delhi my smartphone completes that \nsentence on its own now. when i speak the sentence out, the words taste metallic from being spoken over and over again. the breakfast arrived an hour later. two slices of bread, mixed fruit jam, an orange, a glass of milk and tea. a person came in to clean and sanitise the room. another person changed the bedsheets. someone else came in to take my vitals. yet another person asked me if i had drinking water. i am overwhelmed. i am not used to so much care, so many people constantly checking up on me. it feels strange. almost unreal. i have lived 13 years of my life away from home, away from a family. the only family i know in this city is my immediate colleagues. seeing a group of complete strangers going out of their way to do so much is simply not sinking in. i don't know how much gratefulness is enough. i don't know how to thank these women and men who are risking so much, so much every single day. a doctor came in and we realised our names were the same, but for one letter. we shared a laugh. yesterday, a nurse said she had orders to shoot me on sight, before taking out her heat gun. a senior doctor told me yesterday, this is the best we can do under these circumstances. till your results come in, think of this room as your hostel room. i had to tell him that i had lived in a hostel for three years, and this room was far better and cleaner than that. he laughed from behind that mask. moments like these break the monotony of my day. screens can only do as much. i have been reading every little shred of information on this new coronavirus. i am anxious. the results are yet to come in. the doctor told me today that a lot of new covid-19 suspects have been brought in. the isolation ward is filling up. when i walked in into this wing of the hospital, all rooms were empty. now, the sound of a cough from the adjacent room is a strange kind of reassurance. last night, i heard two people from either side of my room talking to each other. one of them was flying in from dubai, on india's list of covid-19-affected places. the other person has been coughing incessantly. a woman from argentina was very distraught when she was brought in yesterday. she told the staff here that she didn't understand english, before going on to ask for tea and coffee and cold water yes, in english. we are all alone here. all isolated. but we're all together in that too. there are walls between the rooms but there are pigeons outside all our windows. *** three hours after i wrote my last entry, i got a call from the hospital. they said i could leave. my test results had arrived and i had tested negative for the novel coronavirus. as i got ready to pull my bag out of the room, the ward boy opened the door. he had my plastic-wrapped lunch in his hand. i told him i was leaving. i couldn't see his face breaking into a smile, but the eyes announced he was happy. they had one less person to worry about.
