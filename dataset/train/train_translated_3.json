", "label": 0}, {"content": "coronavirus: fighting a psychological battle. anxiety is creeping up as the virus which originated in wuhan spreads around the world, showing no sign as yet of abating.   singapore is at code orange in its disease outbreak response system condition, a crisis management system drafted and refined after singapore's experience of tackling the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) outbreak in 2003.   it was at yellow for days before being raised to orange on friday evening, after a few local cases emerged without any links to previous cases or travel history to china.   will it move to red, which would mean the virus is severe and spreading widely?   from what is known publicly, the coronavirus appears to be more infectious than sars, which hit singapore in 2003 from march to may, infecting 238 and killing 33.   sars infected more than 8,000 people worldwide over several months, and killed about 774.   however, the coronavirus appears less deadly, with a mortality rate of about 2 per cent, compared with sars' 9.6 per cent.   the middle east respiratory syndrome virus in 2012 infected about 2,500 people worldwide but was deadlier, with a fatality rate of 34 per cent.   with the coronavirus, as of yesterday, more than 34,000 have been infected since december, and more than 700 have died in china.   in singapore, there are 40 infected persons as of yesterday.   outside of hubei province, where wuhan is located, the mortality rate is only 0.2 per cent so far, while seasonal influenza has a death rate of 0.1 per cent. this makes the new virus much closer to influenza than sars.   sars was spread by people after they developed symptoms like fever; 2019-ncov, as the new virus is officially known, appears to be sneakier, and can spread from an infected person who shows no symptoms.   this makes the coronavirus harder to detect and easier to spread. the odds of it spiralling out of control within the community are thus higher than with sars.   however, initial reports suggest that it does not make people as sick as sars did. some doctors are already predicting that this coronavirus may be more like influenza - many people could get infected with mild sickness; a small proportion (now 15 per cent) will get seriously sick but will recover; and a tiny fraction (now 2 per cent) may die.   in may 2009, the h1n1 outbreak from the united states surged into singapore. by the time it came under control in february 2010, 415,000 people here had been infected, and 420,000 had been vaccinated.   in the end, 18 people here died of the h1n1 virus, which remains the dominant flu strain globally and in singapore. it is highly infectious, but people have come to terms with living with it, as it has a low fatality rate of 0.02 per cent.   will the coronavirus turn out to be a highly infectious non-event? or a fast-spreading virus that kills a large number in its wake?   so far, several experts have predicted it will be the former.   meanwhile, china is patenting a drug \nfound to be highly effective in treating the disease. many labs around the world are also vying to be the first to develop a vaccine.   singaporeans should educate and update themselves on the virus so that they can make rational, sensible choices for themselves and their families.   in singapore, it is clear that political leaders are trying to prepare singaporeans for the long haul. no one can predict for sure how this virus outbreak will pan out. but the experience of sars gives some pointers.   i am the author of a book on sars. titled a defining moment: how singapore beat sars, it was published in 2004, and it details singapore's whole-of-government, whole-of-society approach to battling the virus. (the book is out of print, but can be borrowed from the national library.)   drawing from what we went through with sars, we can better prepare ourselves for the long battle against the coronavirus.   one key takeaway from that experience is that when there is wide community spread, the battle against the virus will be as much about mindsets as it is about medicine.   the psychological aspect came to the fore over the weekend, as many people in singapore, young and old, stripped supermarket shelves of essentials like noodles, rice and even toilet paper, in a frenzy of stockpiling. this was despite assurances from government leaders and retailers that there are stocks aplenty in warehouses.   singapore is a small, close-knit society, and prone to the herd mentality and mass behaviour.   social psychology tells us that in times of anxiety, people tend to conform and follow what others are doing. (\"my neighbours are stocking up on food; they know something i don't, so i am going to do the same.\")   they also start to worry for themselves and their loved ones. (\"everyone else is stocking up; there won't be any left for me and my family; i am going out to grab my share.\")   the best way to stop such thinking is to be rational. (\"how many packs of rice do i need? are rice imports going to stop? will there be rice stocks next week?\")   and then be deliberately pro-social and think of others. (\"do i really need all these alcohol swabs now? what if i buy the last pack of swabs and deprive a sick person who needs it for his daily injection?\")   individual actions have collective impact. we are all in this virus outbreak together, and we stand or fall together.   right now, most of us still go about our daily lives sans mask, gloves or protective clothing, albeit with more attention to hand washing with soap and water, using hand sanitiser and avoiding touching our faces - infection control tips 101.   but the mood can shift quickly, and we can become a city ruled by fear of strangers and public spaces.   for example, about 30,000 workers from china have yet to return to singapore from their chinese new year leave. there is a risk of infections going up when they return.   as concerns about community spread widen, more people can be expected to take \nprecautions to protect their loved ones and themselves, by donning protective gear or avoiding crowded spaces.   with sars, once the virus spread, people started fearing being around others, not knowing who might be infected.   they then reacted by shunning those at risk. many also stayed home, away from shops and eateries, causing businesses to suffer. it took concerted action to shift singaporeans' mindsets.   the sars experience reminds us that the battle against the virus is fought on two fronts: medical and psychological.   the medical battle has to do with screening, public hygiene, infection control, diagnosis, treatment of patients, and the race to develop quicker diagnostic tools, better treatment protocols or a vaccine.   the psychological war is about overcoming fear, prejudice and paranoia.   from sars, we know there are three fronts in the psychological battle.   we must guard against ostracising healthcare workers, who are at the forefront of the fight against the virus.   as the virus spreads widely, more people will be infected and need care. this means healthcare workers will be at greater risk.   during sars, some singaporeans reacted by shunning them. this is already happening again. home affairs minister k. shanmugam noted in a facebook post on friday that he had heard anecdotally about cases of abuse directed at healthcare workers.   nurses have taken to facebook to share anecdotes of how they were ostracised on the mrt and scolded for wearing their uniforms onto the train as fellow travellers feared they were spreading germs.   this prompted commenters to express support for the nurses, with one post saying: \"if you think the nurses and doctors carry lots of germs or if you think that we are dirty, please get your family to nurse you when you are hospitalised.\"   a young nurse i featured in the sars book described how, after working hard all day to treat patients at \"sars central\" in tan tock seng hospital (ttsh), she would find herself shunned on the mrt because of her nurse's uniform; neighbours refused to share a lift with her, or shut their windows as she walked past their flats.   she said with a frown: \"it made me really angry. here we were, trying our best to fight for our patients. if we were not there in the sars wards, who would be there for them?\"   others complained that buses and cabs, and even pizza delivery staff, refused to call at ttsh stops.   the issue was made public by ministers, who urged singaporeans to change their mindsets.   within days, people responded. about 500,000 peach ribbons were made and worn by members of the public to support healthcare workers. ttsh received sachets of herbal lozenges for their staff; anonymous donors sent 60 crates of fuji apples and 1,000 stalks of gerberas. a fund to salute healthcare workers, called the courage fund, raised $28.5 million, and fund administrators had to ask the public to stop giving to it.   the change motivated healthcare workers and created a more \npositive atmosphere nationwide.   this time round, i hope singaporeans will avoid the shunning and abusive stage and go straight to the stage of appreciating our front-line soldiers in the fight against the virus.   of those who died during sars, about 40 per cent were healthcare workers. they put their lives on the line to care for those infected. they are heroes. they deserve our support and appreciation, not our fear and discrimination.   words, thoughtful acts, practical or heartfelt tokens and social media tributes can all make a difference in rallying our healthcare troops.   the second front in the psychological war is in business.   as the virus spreads and fear rises, the temptation to hunker down and stay home will prove irresistible. but this will affect businesses badly. a shutdown will only harm our own society.   during sars, singaporeans went into panic lockdown mode for a few weeks. the mood seemed darkest in late march and early april, four weeks into the outbreak.   in april came news that the virus had spread to the singapore general hospital, and then beyond hospitals, to a wholesale market.   but the mood suddenly shifted in the second half of april, and people started coming out to shop.   clothing retailer zara's opening on april 23 at liat towers attracted hundreds. best denki's $99 offer of a bar fridge at its new bishan junction 8 outlet drew a queue of 200 by opening time. concerts went ahead. pubs and nightspots reported a surge in business.   \"it was almost as though the sars-induced fear had a life of its own - its own incubation period, and its own life cycle. it was as though, after being cooped up for weeks, singaporeans decided enough was enough and ventured out,\" i wrote in the book.   what shifted the mood were deliberate campaigns to boost consumer confidence, bolstered by savvy sales promotions (like the $99 fridge).   one important initiative was the cool singapore programme to provide a sars-free corridor for tourists and shoppers by ensuring that places like the airport, taxis, hotels, shopping malls and restaurants were sars-free.   this was done by introducing regular temperature checks and screening measures at these places. establishments that met criteria for such screening were audited and certified fever-free to assure shoppers.   the programme was effective, as no case of sars surfaced at these establishments, since staff with fever were quickly identified and isolated. it also sent a message to the world that singapore had sars under control.   if sars was any guide, people will hunker down first, then bounce back to business as usual if they feel safe and if deals are attractive enough. reassurances of safety should thus be matched by concrete action like a programme to audit and certify retail joints.   the third front in the psychological battle against the virus lies in our own hearts and mindsets.   it is too easy to blame the victim and lash out with anti-china or anti-chinese sentiments, as \nis happening worldwide. in the us, canada, new zealand, australia, france, denmark and a host of other countries, some people and media reports are targeting people from china, people who are ethnic chinese or people who look east asian for abuse because of the virus.   in singapore, where the majority population is ethnic chinese, we must not succumb to such racism or xenophobia. we must remember that foreigners are not the culprits; indeed, about one-third of our healthcare workforce, who are risking their lives to fight the virus, are foreign.   china, meanwhile, is putting up a valiant fight to contain the virus, after an initial state of denial. as many have noted, locking down wuhan and its surrounds to contain the virus was tantamount to sacrificing a province to save the rest of china and the world.   after interviewing scores of people for the sars book, including patients, nurses, doctors, hospital chiefs, civil servants and government ministers, i came away convinced that the much-criticised singapore nanny state is impressive in action.   government authorities nagged about hygiene, cajoled shoppers onto the streets, and enforced quarantine orders.   the state and its apparatus of community organisations, unions, business groups, religious groups, media organisations and grassroots bodies worked together to trace contacts and deliver timely information, thermometers and food to the quarantined and consolation to the isolated.   each night, a press conference helmed by ministers debunked rumours, keeping the information flow open and smooth.   today, 17 years later, the singapore government should be better prepared than in 2003 to lead the fight against the new coronavirus. meanwhile, our healthcare workers are highly trained and brave.   it remains for us, as individuals, to realise that what we each do makes a huge collective difference.   take responsibility for personal hygiene. wash hands. avoid touching your face. observe leave of absence and quarantine rules. mask up if unwell and seek medical attention.   act responsibly and avoid panic behaviour like stockpiling food, masks or protective equipment. doing so increases the chance of shortages for people who genuinely need the items.   do not shun or shame but be kind to all, including the infected, the quarantined, healthcare workers and those from china.   most of all, do not give in to paranoia or fear. keep calm and carry on. because we are in it together.

'completely chaotic' japanese authorities have said they made a decision to disembark passengers who tested negative during the quarantine period as they took measures to prevent spread of the virus - passengers were confined to their cabins, except for brief outings on open deck when they were required to wear gloves and masks and keep their distance from fellow passengers. however, infectious diseases specialist kentaro iwata has said the situation on the ship was \"completely chaotic\" and violated quarantine procedures, in blunt criticism rarely seen in japanese officialdom. the kobe university professor later said he had heard from a colleague on board that quarantine procedures had improved, but still recommended that all those disembarking the ship should be monitored for at least 14 days and should avoid contact with others. since wednesday, about 970 passengers - who tested negative after the government put the ship under quarantine on february 5 - have disembarked, according to local media. on saturday, around 100 more passengers who had reportedly been in close contact with infected people on board were allowed to get off. they included the last group of japanese passengers while some foreign passengers were still waiting on board for their governments to send chartered aircraft. with the latest disembarkation, a 14-day quarantine is expected to start for more than 1 000 crew still on board. many of them were not placed in isolation as they were needed to keep the ship running - preparing food and delivering meals to cabins. critics have charged that they were inadvertently spreading the virus throughout the ship, which has seen more than 600 cases of the potentially deadly covid-19 disease. kato defended japan's on-board quarantine, telling a tv programme saturday there was no medical facility large enough to admit more than 3 000 people at once.

 \n the coronavirus family of viruses includes the common cold and more serious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers).  \n many of those with the new virus who have died had pre-existing medical conditions or were elderly, those with weakened immune systems.  \n coronavirus infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, cough and breathing difficulties.  \n statistics from china indicate that about 2% of people infected with the new virus have died, suggesting it may be deadlier than seasonal flu but less deadly than sars, which killed about 10% of infected individuals. the mers outbreak in 2012 had a fatality rate of about 35%.  \n scientists have labelled the new virus 2019-ncov.  \n (graphic-comparing new coronavirus to sars and mers: https://tmsnrt.rs/2gk6yvk)  \n  \n how is it transmitted and how can it be prevented?  \n the virus can be transmitted via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes, and can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles.  \n experts have said it is more easily transmitted than the sars virus. the incubation period is up to 14 days. people may be able to infect others before symptoms appear.  \n the world health organization (who) recommends that people frequently wash hands, cover mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing, and avoid close contact with those who are sick.  \n  \n do face masks help?  \n \"we recommend the use of masks for people who have symptoms ... because the virus transmits through droplets,\" says medical expert sylvie briand.  \n but they do not guarantee protection against infection.  \n \"for people who don't have symptoms, the mask in fact is not useful,\" briand says.  \n the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention says face masks are not required for the general public.  \n  \n is there any treatment?  \n there is no vaccine or known effective treatments, according to the who.  \n chinese scientists were able to identify the genetic sequence of the new coronavirus and shared it publicly. scientists in australia have developed a lab-grown version of the virus, a step toward creating a vaccine.  \n drugmakers around the globe expect to begin testing experimental vaccines on humans in about three months.  \n  \n where has it spread?  \n about 99% of the more than 30,000 cases have been reported in mainland china. nearly 230 cases have been reported in about 27 other countries and regions, a reuters tally based on official statements shows.  \n over 600 people have died in china, most in and around the city of wuhan, where the virus emerged late last year. one person has died in hong kong and one in the philippines, both following visits to wuhan.  \n singapore, thailand and japan have the most cases outside of china  \n it took the new coronavirus 48 days to infect the first1,000 people. it took sars 130 days to infect 1,000 people. ittook mers 2.5 years to infect 1,000 people.  \n  \n what are authorities doing?

Many people are unsettled in view of the increasing number of confirmed infections. The most common questions and answers to the novel coronavirus, lung disease COVID-19 and recommended precautionary measures. Who is particularly at risk? The Chairman of the Bremer Hospitality Association, Hans-Michael M\u00fchlenfeld, mainly calls these risk groups: \"First and foremost, people with the lung must endanger COPD and asthma, they are the most important group in my assessment. Second group are patients with a heart failure, the so-called heart failure. Even older counts to the risk group as well as basically chronically ill patients. \"You should avoid as human beings as possible, according to the Bremer family doctor. That also applies to bus and train. M\u00fchlenfeld: \"Who necessarily has to go shopping into the supermarket, should do so if little operation is.\" How is the coronavirus transferred? The main transmission path of SARS-COV-2 is the droplet infection according to the Berlin Robert Koch Institute (RKI). This could be done directly from person to person about the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract or indirectly over his hands, which are then brought into contact with oral or nasal mucosa as well as the eye-inclusive. \"Cases were also known in which persons have infected with those affected, which had shown only light or non-specific symptoms,\" says on the RKI website. The novel coronaviruses have also been found in stool samples of a few affected. Whether SARS-COV-2 can also be spreading fecal orally, but not yet finally clarified. Which symptoms causes the coronavirus? According to RKI, an infection with the novel coronavirus such as other respiratory pathogens can lead to symptoms such as cough, cold, gross scratches and fever, some sufferers suffered from diarrhea. \"In the cases mainly from China, four of five disease gradients were mild. In a part of the patients, the virus can lead to a heavier course with breathing problems and pulmonary inflammation, \"says the RKI with. What should one do if you have the suspicion to be infected? \"Under no circumstances should you go directly to the doctor or in a hospital. Because there is the danger that you can infect other people, \"says the Bremer family doctor M\u00fchlenfeld. \"You should first contact the doctor or local health office by phone.\" The Robert Koch Institut in Berlin also advises: who had contact to already infected, should contact the health department regardless of the occurrence of symptoms. Doctors and offices could cause a laboratory examination during suspected SARS COV-2. If you have a reasonable suspicion to be infected, according to RKI, should avoid unnecessary contacts, do not go to work and too \nstay at home. Even people who suffer from suspected cold complaints such as coughing should avoid contact with others, emphasizes millfield. Covid-19 symptoms could also be milder and would therefore possibly not recognized or not associated with the coronavirus. \"An infection risk for others is still - even for flu.\" What applies to travelers who return? \"Persons who have stopped in a risk territory reported by the RKI should - regardless of symptoms - avoid unnecessary contacts and remain at home as far as possible. When acute respiratory symptoms, you should pay attention to the cough and Nies etiquette as well as good hand hygiene and, by telephone reservation with reference to the journey, see a doctor, \"says the website of the Robert Koch Institute. For travelers from regions where Covid-19 cases occur, but they are no risks: if you develop fever, cough or shortness of the return within 14 days after the return journey, you should - after telephone registration and with reference to the journey - visit a doctor. In addition, you should avoid unnecessary contacts. How dangerous is the virus? According to the Robert Koch Institute, there are currently not enough data for a final assessment of the severity of the new respiratory disease. Deaths have not yet occurred in patients who were older and / or suffered from chronic basic diseases. According to a recent analysis of Chinese's Health Authority, 2.3 percent die in the country infected with SARS COV-2. In humans over 80 years, according to RKI, the death rate calculated from the data available there lies at just under 15 percent, so in this age group in China in contributing about 15 out of 100 infected. In the group of ten to 39-year-old people die then 0.2 percent of the infected, ie about two of 1000 concerned. Experts assume that mortality is actually lower than calculated in China, among other things, because in Chinese statistics many mild extensive infections would not be covered. How can one protect against contagion? For protection against these as well as other viruses, experts recommend ordinary hygiene measures, which is also explicitly pointed out each year in the flu season. \"The most important and effective measures for personal protection as well as protecting others prior to contagion with pathogens of respiratory infections are good hand hygiene, a correct cough and NIES etiquette, as well as the spacing (about one to two meters) of potentially ill people,\" emphasizes the Bremen family doctor. Disposable handkerchiefs should be thrown away after using. Protective masks are unnecessary for healthy, says Oliver Witzke, director of the Clinic for Infectiology of University Medicine Eating. According to RKI, there is no \nSufficient evidence ensures that wearing a mouth nose protection reduces the risk of infection for a healthy person carrying it. However, a mask can be a mask for diseased persons: \"If a person suffering from acute respiratory infection must move in public space, wearing a mouth nose protection can be useful by this person to make the risk of infection of other persons through droplets To reduce, reduce, reduce the cough or sneeze, \"says the website of the Federal Center for Health Enlightenment (BZGA). How is Covid-19 treated? There is no special therapy for the COVID-19 disease. \"At the center of the treatment of infection, the optimal supporting measures according to the severity of the disease - for example oxygenation, compensation of the liquid balance, optionally antibiotic for the treatment of bacterial alternative or accompanying infections as well as the treatment of relevant basic diseases,\" says the RKI Website. Is there a vaccine? Currently no vaccine is available. According to media reports, a first vaccine candidate should be tested in a clinical trial in a clinical trial in China. When a vaccine could be available, is currently not foreseeable. Can one infect about goods or food from a risk area? An infection with the novel coronavirus over surfaces is considered unlikely. This applies to food as well as toys or other goods. For example, fruits from northern Italy could continue to be bought and consumed without concerns, Professor Lars Schaade said from RKI. The World Health Organization WHO assumes that the pathogen SARS-COV-2 can survive on surfaces for several days. According to the Federal Headquarters for Health Enlightenment, however, no case is documented for transmission over inanimate surfaces. Nevertheless, regular and thorough hand washing is important - especially because it is also the best protection against the direct virus transfer from man to person to person, with coronaviren as well as the flu. How does the coronavirus test work? When suspected of SARS COV-2, the pathogen is usually detected with a molecular biological test. First, a doctor takes a sample from the respiratory tract of a patient, a smear or hurried mucus. Specialists then prepare this sample in the laboratory and search with a PCR test according to the inheritance of the virus. Simplified, a specific section of the virus genome is copied millions of times. The copies are marked in color with a so-called probe. This color mark can be made visible with complex devices.

mr marc lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology and director of the centre for communicable disease dynamics at the harvard t.h. chan school of public health in the united states, said it was a \"prevailing misconception\" that sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) disappeared in the summer of 2003.   \"i think the word 'disappear' is a terrible word for what happened with sars,\" he said. \"sars was controlled by extremely intense public health efforts, heroic and perhaps unprecedented in modern times. it did not disappear at all.\"   as sars-cov-2 \u2014 the formal name for the new coronavirus\u00a0\u2014 spreads around the world, the different ways in which countries deal with it will have a major impact on how long its stays around, experts said.   \"we are not sure whether it (covid-19) will recur, but with the differences in public health legislature, policies and patterns of human behaviour at the global level it will last for a while,\" said professor emily chan ying-yang, a medical professor at the chinese university of hong kong and a visiting professor at oxford university.   earlier this month, ms chan co-chaired an expert panel discussion at a conference organised by the world health organization in geneva to set the research agenda for the disease.   ms amesh adalja, a senior scholar at the johns hopkins university centre for health security in the us, said it was likely the novel coronavirus would become endemic.   \"i suspect that this novel virus will become endemic in the population. it may become the fifth seasonal coronavirus until a vaccine is developed,\" he said.   he said also that with \"over two dozen countries supporting the spread of this virus, we are in the early stages of a pandemic\".   mr michael osterholm, director of the centre for infectious disease research and policy at the university of minnesota, said that the way in which the virus was spreading within communities suggested it was likely to stay around for some time.   \"there's enough infection in humans right now [for it to] sustain itself,\" he said. \"i can't imagine why it would burn itself out in humans, it seems to like humans far too much.\"   mr roy hall, a professor of microbiology specialising in viruses at the university of queensland, said that in many cases viruses became weaker after they adapted to their human hosts.   \"there are subtle changes as a virus adapts to a new host and it may be that in a couple of months, after it's been through many generations in humans it changes,\" he said.   \"as the virus adapts ... it may become more efficient at infecting cells and therefore at being transmitted. sometimes that has a \ncounterbalance: as it becomes more transmissible it becomes less virile. so you get more virus spreading but the disease will be less severe.\"   doctors currently recognise seven coronaviruses that affect humans, of which three\u00a0\u2014 mers-cov, which causes middle east respiratory syndrome, sars-cov (sars) and sars-cov-2 (covid-19)\u00a0\u2014 cause the most serious complications within humans.   mr osterholm said that while there were different models of transmission for the serious coronaviruses, it was not yet clear how the new one would develop.   \"with the sars model, [the virus] spills over from the animal reservoir and has a pattern where most of the infectiousness is well into the clinical disease, so you can quickly identify someone who is potentially a case, isolate them so they don't infect others and bring the disease to an end by eliminating the known animal reservoir and stopping the humans from transmitting,\" he said.   \"the mers model is an intermediate model, where the animal reservoir is never eliminated ... but because infectiousness is late in the clinical course, we can identify patients, get them into isolation, and follow up their contacts and they don't continue to transmit any more.\"   in contrast, the four seasonal coronaviruses currently known to science\u00a0\u2014 229e, nl63, oc43 and hku1\u00a0\u2014 never go away.   \"hku-1 is responsible for 1-2 per cent of severe pneumonia cases in the us. it's a low-level problem, but it stays and transmits around the world,\" mr osterholm said, citing figures from a study carried out in a single city.   some experts have said that even if covid 19 eased in the summer it might still recur in the winter. but zhong nanshan, china's leading expert on respiratory diseases, told a press conference this week that the chances of the disease recurring every winter, like influenza, were small if the number of cases in the current outbreak could be minimised.   the us centres for disease control and prevention said it was hoping the epidemic would ease in the warmer weather.   \"other viral respiratory diseases, including influenza, are seasonal and we do see a decrease in spring and summer,\" dr nancy messonnier, director of the cdc's national centre for immunisation and respiratory diseases, said this week. \"so we can be optimistic that this disease will follow suit.\"   but not everyone shares that view.   \"so far we don't know how this coronavirus reacts in summer,\" ms chan said.   mr lipsitch said: \"new viruses that have more options of who to infect have an easier time even when the weather is not favourable. even though coronaviruses that we know about tend to be seasonal, it would be wrong to expect this will fall into the same pattern.\"   ms adalja said that it was also wrong to think the new virus would behave in exactly the same way in different parts of the world.   \"i suspect in the northern hemisphere we may see some diminishment of transmission, but this will not occur in the southern hemisphere,\" he said.   for \nmr lipsitch, the danger is assuming that covid-19 is \"just another type of flu\", as with an estimated mortality rate of about 2 per cent it is far more serious.   \"most people said the 1918 influenza pandemic killed about 2 per cent of those who were sick ... it looks to me that it [covid-19] is somewhat milder than that, but not necessarily a lot,\" he said.   \"the 2009 flu pandemic killed something like less than one in a thousand of those who got sick. so two in a hundred is a very large difference.\"   \"one is annoyance and the other one is catastrophe. saying it

", "label": 1}, {"content": "coronavirus scare: does work from home policy help?. with the coronavirus outbreak declared a pandemic by the world health organisation (who), many companies around the world have asked their employees to work from home until the virus is contained. some large firms and start-ups in india have now followed suit in line with the government's measure to limit the spread of the virus, as the number of confirmed cases in india jumped to over 70. india also recorded its first death from the novel coronavirus (covid-19) on thursday. companies such as cognizant, amazon, flipkart, snapdeal, uber, ola, swiggy, paytm, wipro and tech mahindra have offered employees the option to work from home. there are many other indian companies, especially startups, which have asked their respective employees to work from home. a google office in bengaluru has asked all employees to work from home tomorrow after a techie was tested positive for the virus. the tech firm has already asked all north american employees to work from home. several industry bodies like nasscom have already requested the government to waive restrictions around work from home in light of the coronavirus outbreak which has spread to hundreds of countries around the globe. though work from home could hurt operations flow at indian firms, top management at corporate firms has instructed or recommended employees to work from home. one way recommended by health experts in tackling the virus is avoiding large gatherings or social distancing. delhi's deputy chief minister manish sisodia on friday also advocated social distancing as a measure as the government banned big events, conferences and social gatherings. social distancing as solution  it has worked for china, which finally declared on thursday that the peak of coronavirus was over in the epicentre hubei province and wuhan city. the number of newly reported cases had dropped to 8 for the first time ever since the initial infections were recorded. affected areas in china were kept under lockdown, causing severe disruptions to daily life. several major factories and industries were shut and people were even asked to work from home. though this caused economic damage to china and the global economy, the \"social distancing\" measures seem to have worked well for the country worst affected by the novel coronavirus. major technology companies including the likes of apple are now looking to reopen all branded stores in china after a period of strict measures. italy, which along with iran is one of the worst affected due to coronavirus, is also following a similar strategy of social lockdown to contain the spread of covid-19 infections. many factories have been shut as a result of the lockdown. even french president emmanuel macron urged employers to allow their staff to work from home, wherever possible. meanwhile, with the number of cases rising in the uk, a leading researcher told everyone in the country, who can work from home, should avoid going to \noffice. william hanage, an epidemiologist at the center for disease dynamics at the harvard th chan school of public health in boston, told the guardian that the rising number of infections in the uk could lead to local outbreaks in coming weeks and people should start working from home to prevent the possibility of contracting the coronavirus. imf chief economist gita gopinath said in a recent blog post that \"this health crisis will have a significant economic fallout\" due to supply shocks and demand. in short, the economic fallout of coronavirus is unavoidable and efforts should be towards keeping people/employees healthy. this would help affected countries bounce back smoothly, suggest economists. therefore, both economists and health experts suggest that the primary goal in order to bring the global economy back on track is to keep people healthy and safe during the peak of the virus outbreak. india and its billion-plus the risk of the virus spreading in india is much greater due to the sheer number of citizens. with its billion-plus population, india could find itself in a pool of worries if infections rise. cases in india have spiked significantly over the last few days. since the precautions to tackle coronavirus are limited, it could be difficult to prevent infections from rising in india, especially in offices that employ a large number of people. the government has directed schools and colleges to be closed, but it would hardly matter if office-goers bring the virus home to their children. while many humorous takes on the subject have been posted by users on social media, the fact remains that children and other family members are not safe if the working individuals in their family have to face the risks. though a large-scale work from home policy could trigger disruptions in operational flow, companies may follow the trend as the first objective should be to limit the spreading of coronavirus. firms and organisations which have not announced work from home for employees yet have implemented several precautionary measures to prevent the virus from spreading. however, it should be noted that employees who have to report at work may face a higher chance of contracting the virus. they are exposed to public transport, food, and more people - something that most health experts have asked to avoid. over 700 employees working at a private factory in noida have been kept under watch after a person was tested positive. at a time when the entire world is trying to fight an unknown virus, experts said each and every part of the society, including organisations and firms, should take all necessary steps to tackle the virus from spreading even at the cost of disruptions. as the saying goes: prevention is better than cure. ", "label": 1}, {"content": "an economic coronary. just as the war clouds in west asia seemed to be receding, with the us toning down its tirade against iran, calamity appeared on the horizon. as of march 11, the novel coronavirus -- covid-19 -- had infected 121,312 people in 120 nations and territories, with over 4,379 deaths reported worldwide. china, which saw 80,788 infected and 3,158 fatalities since the outbreak began in december 2019, has begun to see a lull in the incidence of the disease. but elsewhere, it is still on the rise. korea has seen 7,755 cases, italy 10,149, germany 1,622, the us 1,016 and the uk, 383. india has seen 62 cases with no casualties reported yet. while the disease and deaths pose a huge social challenge to governments worldwide, the economic costs are already significant. on march 4, the united nations conference on trade and development (unctad) said the slowdown in manufacturing in china owing to the covid-19 outbreak would cause a $50 billion disruption in trade. it estimated the impact on india alone at $348 million (rs 2,575 crore)-an enormous sum, but dwarfed by the $15.5 billion impact on the eu and the $5.7 billion hit on the us. however, union finance minister nirmala sitharaman has said there is no need to panic about the economy, with pti quoting her as saying that coronavirus will be a challenge for india only if the situation is not resolved within three weeks. india imported $70.4 billion worth of goods from china in 2018-19 and exported $16.8 billion to it. a disruption in trade will leave consumer durables, electronics and solar panels the worst hit, as these depend heavily on chinese imports, as per a crisil report in february. \"about 90 per cent of the components of mobile and electronics are imported, largely from china,\" says n.k. goyal, chairman emeritus of the telecom equipment manufacturers association of india. \"coronavirus is likely to affect the supply chain. the orders are placed 2-3 months in advance. the shortage will be felt in the coming days.\" it will likely result in production of telecom equipment being scaled down, leading to potential job losses, he adds. india also impor\u00adted auto components worth $4.6 billion (rs 34,040 crore) from china in fiscal 2019. \"the outbreak will affect the economy overall, though it hasn't been much of an issue for our company yet,\" says r.c. bhargava, chairman of maruti suzuki. s. muralishankar, president of the association of indian forging industry, a major supplier of auto parts, says that although some areas where auto components are manufactured have returned to normal, shipments will resume only from march 15. \"it will take 4-5 weeks for [the shipments to arrive]. there are also reports of huge pile-ups at ports, causing further delays,\" he says. g.v. prasad, co-chairman and ceo of the hyderabad-based dr reddy's laboratories, acknowledges the disruption in the pharma supply chain. \"as of now, our company is reasonably covered in terms of raw material thanks to the buffer \ninventory. however, if manufacturing does not resume in china in the next four weeks, we will see supply disruptions. our business in china is impacted too-we are unable to ship products,\" he says. china also supplies 80 per cent of the solar cells india needs. despite chinese solar panel makers resuming production, indian players are not sure if supplies will resume in the next 2-3 quarters. indian solar firms are thus at risk of missing deadlines and facing fines and penalties. sunil jain, ceo of the new delhi-based hero future energies, says companies will require financial support for working capital and interest payments due to these delays. reports from china suggest that many solar panel factories are running at 60 per cent capacity. the outbreak has disrupted the logistics sector as well. cargo movement from factories to ports -- which earlier took about 36 hours-now takes over eight days. fewer truck drivers, more checkpoints, shortages at chinese ports -- it's all adding up. equipment suppliers have defaulted on long-term shipping commitments, forcing shipping firms to look for spot bookings. \"this requires cash payments. the suppliers are not in a position to pay in cash, neither are we,\" explains a solar firm ceo. shipping costs have gone through the roof; air cargo services, too, have come to a halt in china. the disruption in supply chains will have a direct bearing on manufacturing in india. depleting inventories have forced production cuts. and as if the outbreak in china were not enough, fresh covid-19 cases in the us, europe and elsewhere have dealt a severe blow to several businesses, from automotive to garments to gems, jewell\u00adery, even coffee. cancelled business meeti\u00adngs, travel plans and events have hit the airline and hospitality sectors. the impact is also being felt on dalal street-on february 28, rs 5 lakh crore of investor wealth was wiped out as markets crashed on coronavirus concerns. plunging oil prices, coupled with the disease scare, led to more market mayhem on march 9, when the sensex plunged over 2,300 points, its greatest-ever single day fall. more pain in sight the spread of the virus will mean a difficult two quarters for the indian economy, already in a slump, with gdp growth at just 4.7 per cent in the third quarter of this fiscal. \"india's problem is much bigger because we are already in a slowdown and there is a recession in exports and manufacturing. trade, transport, hotels and tourism have all been feeling the impact,\" says n.r. bhanumurthy, professor at the national institute of public finance and policy in delhi. for jayant sinha, chair of the standing committee on finance, it is not just the short-term impact of major supply shocks. \"we have to consider the dramatic decline in demand of all kinds of goods and services.\" \"the impact on the indian economy will be substantial, since value chains are intimately linked to china,\" says biswajit dhar, professor at jawaharlal nehru university. this crisis, \nhe says, is revealing the fragilities of globalisation. \"there are some sectors in which india should not be dependent on global markets. we took that decision with foodgrains, but we have not done it in healthcare. our pharma industry depends completely on china.\" china is also among india's biggest markets for products like cotton yarn, sea food, petrochemicals, gems and jewellery. the coronavirus crisis has left exporters reeling. \"if the situation continues, the fisheries sector may incur a loss of more than rs 1,300 crore,\" says charles george, president of the kerala fishermen united front. india exported rs 5,673 crore worth of marine products to china in 2018-19. similarly, gems and jewellery exporters in jaipur say the cancellation of four major trade events between february and april caused an estimated loss of rs 8,000-10,000 crore in terms of business opportunity. what next? to grapple with the crisis in the electronics and telecom equipment space, reliance jio is now considering a multi-vendor strategy. its current 4g vendor, samsung, may not be able to ensure supplies, with the virus spreading to south korea too. the challenge is greater for airtel and vodafone, who buy most of their equipment from chinese majors huawei and zte. they could switch to european suppliers ericsson, siemens and nokia, but that could be expensive. the problem is even worse for smaller players. in the past few years, noida's industrial areas have become home to many small electronics manufacturers who import equipment in semi or completely knocked down form from china. the dependence on china has precipitated a crisis across the value chain, even leading to the electronics and it ministry off\u00adering to airlift the required components from factories in guangzhou and shanghai. manufacturers had a three-month inventory due to the chinese lunar new year festivities ending mid-february. the delay thereafter could push up prices from april. \"the disruption is real. we don't know how long it will take to return to the pre-coro\u00adnavirus situation. this is the time for indian players to step in and fill the gap,\" says sunil misra, director-general of ieema, an industry lobby for indian electrical and electronics makers manufacturers. opportunity in crisis? what has aided china's growth as a global manufacturing hub is the way it has promoted its institutions and value chains, developed skills and fostered partnerships between industries and the government. india, meanwhile, is still struggling with shopfloor skills. \"in everything needed to propel industry -- from human to physical capital -- we seem to be lagging years behind china,\" says dhar. however, the current crisis is forcing indian companies to diversify their supply chains. sources in the electronics and it ministry say india is also receiving interest from several large electronics makers looking to expand. \"they are working on a scheme meant specifically to attract more component manufacturing. we are \nlooking to meet 70-80 per cent of the demand in the component market locally and export in the next 2-3 years,\" the sources say. what options does the government have to soften the impact? it could frontload expenditure, accelerate the disinvestment process, implement the proposed scrappage policy for the auto sector; bring in tax cuts for aviation and hospitality sectors, and cut gst rates for restaurants. it could give a tax holiday to sectors likely to be worst hit by the pandemic. anand mahindra, chairman of the mahindra group, wants india to treat the situation as an opportunity. 'step up sanitisation and the swachh bharat movement, which will make india more appealing to tourists looking for alternatives to china,' he tweeted on march 9. now may be the time to jumpstart the 'make in india' initiative that has been in a lull. desperate times call for desperate measures.

many have gone out of business - and factories and other workplaces are still not operating at full capacity. on sunday, a central bank official called for stepped-up global policy coordination to manage the economic impact of the pandemic. he said china\u2019s recent policy measures were gaining traction, and it has capacity for further action. chen yulu, a deputy governor at the people\u2019s bank of china (pboc), also said he expects significant improvement in the chinese economy in the second quarter. and while the virus will continue putting upward pressure on near-term consumer prices, there is no basis for long-term inflation or deflation, he told a news briefing. globally, roughly 275,000 people have been infected with the virus, and more than 11,000 have died, according to a reuters tally, with the number of deaths in italy recently surpassing those in china. \u201cnow i think the epidemic has been controlled. but this definitely doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s over,\u201d said a 25-year-old woman surnamed he who works in the internet sector and was visiting the vast summer palace complex in beijing on saturday. \u201ci\u2019m willing to come out today but of course i am still afraid,\u201d she told reuters. the central province of hubei, where the outbreak first emerged late last year in its capital wuhan, reported its fourth straight day of no new cases. china has used draconian measures to contain the spread of the virus, including locking down hubei province. ", "label": 1}, {"content": "kerala: why fighting coronavirus remains challenging. there was even a chance that kerala would become a mini-itality, which, with over 1,000 fatalities, is the most affected country outside of china. around 2.5 million emigrants from kerala work in more than 124 countries. around 500 students from the state study in chinese universities and hundreds of migrant workers, mostly professionals, work in that country. scores of chinese tourists have visited kerala without screening. the alarm was raised after the state saw a spike in covid-19 infection cases, after an nri family from italy returned on february 29 via doha and avoided screening at kochi airport. the family-husband, wife and son-did not reveal the country they had travelled from. they passed the infection to 11 other persons in the state, including a fellow passenger on the doha-kochi flight. the family was traced, identified and quarantined by the state health department after their close relatives developed covid-19 symptoms. this is but one example of the surveillance efforts and determination to tackle the covid-19 virus the state has displayed over the last fifty days. this is kerala's most challenging health mission since the nipah virus outbreak in may-june 2018, which claimed 19 lives. thankfully, compared to other states, kerala has a well-structured healthcare system at the grass root level and efficient delivery mechanism. the state administration even claims its public health indicators match those of developed nations. india began thermal screening passengers from china at airports on january 23, and kochi was among the seven airports where such tests were ordered. kerala's efforts began on january 25, with chief minister pinarayi vijayan directing state health minister k.k. shailaja to assess the threat and chart out an action plan. health minister shailaja soon convened a high level meeting of officials to chalk out the necessary steps. the team, headed by principal secretary for health, dr rajan n. khobragade, decided to follow who protocols to prevent the virus from spreading in the state, while also ensuring that these protocols would not create public panic. \"our first priority is to check the community spread of the virus and provide the best medical support to the infected,\" says chief minister vijayan. the first priority of the state was to set up isolation wards in all medical colleges, district and general hospitals across the state. the kerala health department has also trained medical support teams and issued treatment protocols. the state government has appealed to members of the public to report to the nearest primary health centre if they have returned from infected chinese regions and also directed local self-government authorities to keep a track of people who have recently returned from such areas. in the case of the italy-returned family for instance, the health department began tracking the primary and secondary contacts-people they had come in contact \nwith. twelve teams worked for four days to prepare travel path of the infected persons with the support of national informatics centre. around 4,000 families were contacted and home-quarantined. gps enabled tracking systems have been activated for 588 families in pathanamthitta district. dr harikrishnan, of the state crisis management team, headed the team gathering information tracking possible high-risk contacts. however, despite the vigil, passengers from wuhan entered the state without reporting at health centres-three medical students from wuhan reached kolkata on january 23, then taking domestic flights to kochi. the health department tracked down all three and the 3,000-odd people they came into contact with by january 28, requesting them to observe home quarantines. the students, belonging to alappuzha, thrissur and kasaragod, were hospitalised as they have developed suspected symptoms of covid-19. the first positive case in india was reported from thrissur on january 30 and by february 3, two more cases had tested positive. the state declared the covid -19 outbreak as a state disaster on february 4 and withdrew the notification after five days when no fresh cases tested positive. some argue that kerala's early surveillance and public health awareness campaign minimised the spread of the infection. february passed without panic as the state health department continued its vigil in all 14 districts in the state with medical teams, health volunteers, local self government officials and the district administration keeping a close watch on those who had been home-quarantined, briefing them about the do's and don'ts in the time of covid-19. \"it was the public support and dedicated team of health professionals helped kerala to minimise the spread of covid-19. hundreds of people have remained at home in isolation for 28 days to save kerala from the deadly virus. their responsible social behaviour allowed us to fight the covid-19 outbreak better,\" health minister kk shailaja tells india today. the 63-year-old high school teacher turned political activist has earned plaudits for showing high level of sensitivity in dealing with the crisis and for leading the health department with scientific strategies. the state administration has lauded the health minister's efforts, defending her when the leader of the opposition, ramesh chennithala, verbally attacked her in assembly, calling her a 'publicity maniac' for her daily media briefings about the steps taken by government. after that allegation, chief minister pinarayi vjayan has started hosting these briefings alongside the health minister. however, with the re-emergence of covid-19 in the state, the government has ordered the closing of educational institutions, banned public meetings and festivals, issued guidelines for media in reporting virus outbreak and deployed police teams to screen public and private transport in all entry points to the state. \"we can't relax our vigil as covid-19 is \nspreading to more countries, with casualties rising. the only way we can remain is to follow the guidelines issued by the health department. the restrictions may cause inconvenience; but since it's in the interest of public health, we are insisting on the restrictions,\" said chief minister pinarayi vijayan. the kerala government has also released a smartphone app to publish authentic information on covid-19. the app, named 'gok direct' was downloaded by 2 lakh people with 48 hours of it being published. aside from flagging false information about the virus, the app also creates awareness about medical do's and don'ts. it's not clear yet if the worst is over for the state yet. the health department is following a wait and watch approach, assessing the progression and severity of the virus every day. authorities heaved a sigh of relief after two infected senior citizens responded to treatment. seventeen other infected persons, including an italian national, are also stable and recovering fast. but a minimum 14-day quarantine has been ordered after recovery. \"we have

And if even yesterday the mortal victims were all circumscribed to Chinese territory, today the scenario has changed. The Philippine Department of Health announced, on Sunday, the first death by Coronavirus. The victim is a man of Chinese nationality, 44, who was hospitalized at the Hospital San Lazaro, Manila, since January 25, with a pneumonia caused by Wuhan coronavirus. He passed away on Saturday night. And in China, which was so far the only country with mortal victims accounted for, the deaths do not stop increasing. Since yesterday (Saturday), the new Coronavirus victimized 45 Chinese, raising for 304 the total number of mortal victims. The number of people infected with the disease also rose to 14,380, plus 2,590 people from registered yesterday. Germany also recorded two new cases, identified among the repatriated citizens of Wuhan, raising for ten the number of Germans infected with the virus, announced this Sunday the authorities. The two infected citizens are in isolation at a barracks in Germersheim (West Germany). Wuhan's remaining 111 will remain quarantined at a barracks of the Armed Forces, which was enabled for this purpose. German repatriates are divided into groups into three closed units, with the aim of minimizing the risk of contagion. The surge of pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus (2019-NCOV) was detected at the end of the year in Wuhan. In addition to the continental territory of China and the Chinese regions of Macao and Hong Kong, there are more cases of infection confirmed in 25 other countries, with the new notifications in Russia, Sweden and Spain. In all the containment measures are increasingly tight. The Chinese city of Wenzhou, one of the most affected by the epidemic outside the new coronavirus epidemic, imposed on Sunday a compulsory collect for its more than nine million inhabitants and drastically restricted car circulation, announced local authorities. Residents are required to stay at home and only one person per family is allowed to leave every two days to shop. Public transport are suspended, such as long-distance buses. The main highways are almost totally closed to the car circulation. As in other cities of China, public places like cinemas or pools are closed. Companies will not return to open before 17 February and schools are closed until at least 1 March. Wenzhou, who registers 265 cases of infected people, is located in East China, more than 800 kilometers from Wuhan, city in the center of the country where Coronavirus appeared in December and who is quarantined since January 23. to try to trabel the escalation of deaths and the spread of the virus, the Chinese government issued this morning a protocol for the treatment of corpses \nof the mortal victims caused by Coronavirus, as part of the effort to control the outbreak of pneumonia. The measure makes it impossible for family members to decide where victims are buried and the achievement of funeral ceremonies. The mortal remains of the infected must be cremated at a funerary designated and close to the place where they are, so they can not be transported between different regions, it is read in the protocol emitted together between the National Health Commission, the Ministry of Civil Affairs and the Minister public security. Funeral or farewell ceremonies are prohibited and bodies should be disinfected and placed in a pouch sealed by medical personnel. The funeraries, in turn, should send staff and special vehicles to deliver the bodies according to the designated procedures.

the first fatality in europe and the fourth outside mainland china from an epidemic that has shut chinese factories, curbed travel and disrupted global supply chains.    the outbreak, thought to have originated at a wildlife market in the central chinese province of hubei, has presented china's ruling communist party with the huge challenge of halting its spread while at the same time minimising damage to the world's second-largest economy.    beijing's latest figures on saturday showed 66,492 cases of the illness and 1,523 deaths, mostly in hubei. outside mainland china there have been about 500 cases in some two dozen countries and territories, with four deaths - in japan, chinese-ruled hong kong, the philippines and france.    in the french case, the chinese man died at the bichat hospital in paris of a lung infection due to the flu-like virus, authorities said on saturday.    \"we have to get our health system ready to face a possible pandemic propagation of the virus, and therefore the spreading of the virus across france,\" said health minister agnes buzyn.    robin thompson, an expert in mathematical epidemiology at britain\u2019s university of oxford, said that with nearly 50 cases in europe, a death was not surprising. \"the most important thing to point out, however, is that there still hasn't been sustained person-to-person transmission in europe,\" he added.

orders are in place around the country.    those returning to beijing from the holiday have been ordered to undergo a 14-day self-quarantine to prevent the spread of the virus. many factories are yet to re-open, disrupting supply chains for everyone from smartphone makers to car manufacturers.    while there has been some hope expressed this week that the disease may be peaking in china, numbers keep rising and a trend has been hard to discern, especially after a reclassification that widened the definition of cases.    world health organization (who) chief tedros adhanom ghebreyesus said it was impossible to tell where the epidemic will spread.    \"we are concerned by the continued increase in the number of cases in china,\" tedros told the munich security conference in germany. \"...we

where they face another two weeks of isolation \"out of an abundance of caution\".    passengers on another cruise ship, which finally docked in cambodia on thursday after being rejected by several other countries, were taking their saga in good heart.    \"everyone says 'poor you'. but there was no poor you. we had free internet and free wine. we had three-course meals. there was so much

to oppose plans to turn some buildings into quarantine hubs.    \"doing that (opening such centres) is like creating more wounds rather than trying to stop the bleeding,\" said chan mei-lin among the protesters. tv images showed police making some arrests and using pepper spray.    the sickness, now officially labelled covid-19, has killed around 2% of those infected. cases have spread faster than other respiratory viruses this century.    a senior chinese official sought to project optimism.    \"the impact of the epidemic on the chinese economy will be short term and temporary,\" foreign affairs vice minister qin gang said at the munich security conference.    \"when the epidemic is over, the subdued consumer demand will be released rapidly and the economy will rebound strongly.\"    the chinese central bank said the country's lenders will tolerate higher levels of bad loans as part of efforts to support firms hit by the epidemic.    the economic ripple effects go far beyond china, with supply chain disruptions affecting multiple companies worldwide.    white house economic adviser larry kudlow said the coronavirus might knock two- to three-tenths of a percent off u.s.

signaled a change in tone for the atlanta-based u.s. health agency, which had largely been focused on efforts to stop the virus from entering the country and quarantining individuals traveling from

world health organization says the epidemic has peaked in china, coronavirus cases have surfaced in about 30 other countries, with some three dozen deaths reported, according to a reuters tally. growing outbreaks in iran, italy and south korea have raised concerns that coronavirus will surface in other nations and worsen in those that have already reported infections, further denting a global economy that had already been hit by a dependence on china. global and u.s. stock markets fell sharply again on tuesday, as investors feared the epidemic would further damage an already slowing world economy. the \nwhite house\u2019s top economic adviser, larry kudlow, said the u.s. economy would be able to ride out any disruption from the global spread of coronavirus, adding that he did not expect the federal reserve to cut interest rates to blunt the disease\u2019s economic impact. u.s. senator chuck schumer, however, said republican president donald trump and his administration had been caught \u201cflat-footed\u201d and lacked a comprehensive plan to deal with the coronavirus. he called for at least $3.1 billion in additional funding to fight it. \u201cthe trump administration

vaccine could be made available to the public. but fauci said testing gilead sciences\u2019 (gild.o) antiviral drug remdesivir for potential treatment of coronavirus could be done in a \u201creasonable amount of time.\u201d u.s. secretary of state mike pompeo told reporters that iran may have covered up information about the spread of coronavirus there, and he accused china of

suppressed vital details about the outbreak in that country,\u201d pompeo told reporters as iran\u2019s coronavirus death toll rose to 16. \u201call nations, including iran, should tell the truth about the coronavirus and cooperate with international aid organizations,\u201d pompeo said. his remarks, coming less than two months after a short-lived u.s.-iranian military clash and the signing of a u.s.-china trade deal, could inflame tensions with tehran and beijing. beijing last week revoked the credentials of three wall street journal correspondents over a column china said was racist. the

like most of italy - she was confined to her home. \u201cwhen all this is over,\u201d she vows, \u201cwe will give him a real funeral.\u201d everywhere the coronavirus has struck, regardless of culture or religion, ancient rituals to honor the dead and comfort the bereaved have been cut short or abandoned for fear of spreading it further. the virus, which has killed nearly 9,000 people worldwide, is reshaping many aspects of death, from the practicalities of handling infected bodies to meeting the spiritual and emotional needs of those left behind. in ireland, the health authority is advising mortuary workers to put face masks on dead bodies to reduce even the minor risk of infection. in italy, a funeral company is using video links to allow quarantined families to watch a priest bless the deceased. and in south korea, fear of the virus has caused such a drop in the number of mourners that funeral caterers are struggling for business. there is little time for ceremony in hard-hit cities such as bergamo, northeast of milan, where the mortuaries are full and the crematorium is working around the clock, said giacomo angeloni, a local official in charge of cemeteries. bergamo, home to about 120,000 people, has been dealing with 5-6 times the number of dead it would in normal times, he said. italy has now reported nearly 3,000 deaths from covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus - the highest outside china where the virus first emerged. the italian army sent 50 troops and 15 trucks to bergamo on wednesday to take bodies to less overwhelmed provinces. a ban on gatherings has shattered the vital rituals that help us grieve, said andy langford, the chief operating officer of cruse bereavement care, a british charity providing free care and counseling to those in grief. \u201cfunerals allow a community to come together, express emotion, talk about that person and formally say goodbye,\u201d he said. \u201cwhen you feel you have no control over how you can grieve, and over how you can experience those last moments with someone, that can complicate how you grieve and make you feel worse,\u201d he said. in iran as in northern italy, hospital and funeral workers are overwhelmed with bodies, as the virus has torn across the country, killing 1,284 people and infecting thousands, according to state tv. the authorities have hired new people to dig graves, said a manager at tehran\u2019s behesht-e zahra cemetery. \u201cwe work day and night,\u201d he said. \u201ci have never seen such a sad situation. there are no funerals.\u201d most corpses arrive by \ntruck and are buried without the ritual washing that islam dictates, he said. some iranians suspect that the official haste to bury them has more to do with obscuring the spiraling death toll than halting the spread of the virus. deaths from covid-19 have been recorded as heart attacks or lung infections, a hospital worker in kashan, a city about a three-hour drive from tehran, told reuters. \u201cthe officials are lying about the death toll,\u201d the worker said. \u201ci have seen dozens of corpses in the past few days, but they have told us not to talk about it.\u201d two nurses at iranian hospitals also told reuters they thought the death toll was higher than the official tally. iranian authorities have rejected allegations of a cover-up, and president hassan rouhani, in a televised speech on mar. 18, said his government had been \u201chonest and straightforward with the nation.\u201d in several countries, clusters of infection have followed funerals. in south korea, where more than 90 people have died, the government has urged the families of covid-19 victims to cremate their loved ones first, and hold the funeral later. korean funerals usually take place in hospitals, and involve three days of prayers and feasting. most of the country\u2019s early cases were linked to a church in daegu city and a hospital in a nearby county. in february, several members of the shincheonji church of jesus attended a funeral at the hospital for the brother of the church\u2019s founder. since the outbreak, the number of mourners at funerals has plunged by 90%, regardless of whether the deceased had the virus, said choi min-ho, secretary general of the korea funeral association. \u201cthe culture of funerals has changed significantly,\u201d he said. \u201ca handful of mourners quickly offer condolences and leave the place without dining together out of infection worries.\u201d condolence money, traditionally handed over in cash, is now sent via bank transfer, he added. authorities in wuhan, the epicenter of china\u2019s outbreak and location of the majority of its deaths, quickly identified the funeral business as a potential source of transmission. the local civil affairs bureau in late january ordered all funerals for confirmed covid-19 victims to be handled at a single funeral home in the city\u2019s hankou district. mourning ceremonies, usually boisterous social events in china, were curtailed along with all other public gatherings. those restrictions are still in place, even though the number of new cases has dwindled in recent weeks. bereaved families are not even allowed to see the bodies of their loved ones, a worker at the funeral home told reuters. in china, the ashes of the deceased tend to be kept in funeral homes until they are taken to a family plot on public holidays such as the tomb sweeping festival in april. that\u2019s also canceled this year. in spain, too, a large cluster of cases has been traced to a funeral in the northern town of vitoria in late february. at least 60 people who attended tested positive after \nthe event, said local media reports. with over 600 deaths, spain is the second-worst hit country in europe after italy, and most people are now confined to their homes. referring to these restrictions, prime minister pedro sanchez has called coronavirus a \u201ccruel\u201d disease that paralyses the human need to socialize. in ireland, up to 100 guests are still allowed at all funerals - for now. but most families are opting for small private ceremonies and encouraging others to express their condolences online through websites such as rip.ie, where death notices and funeral invitations are usually posted. open casket funerals are out for any victim of coronavirus, and \u201cthe family should be advised not to kiss the deceased,\u201d according to new guidelines from ireland\u2019s health and safety executive to its funeral directors. the risk of catching coronavirus from a dead body is slim, public health officials say, but some countries are recommending extra measures. israel has reported no coronavirus deaths, but its health ministry says the deceased should be double-wrapped in impermeable plastic. ritual washing and rites will be performed in full protective gear and the corpse re-wrapped in plastic for burial. normally israel\u2019s jewish dead are laid to rest in a cloth smock and shroud. ireland\u2019s guidelines advise workers in funeral parlors to put face masks on dead bodies before moving them, in case they \u201cexpel a very small amount of air and viral droplets from the lungs\u201d and infect the living. in britain, where the pandemic is still gathering pace, there is widespread anxiety about the likely death toll. britain has been slower in implementing the strict measures seen elsewhere in europe, and expert estimates of how many will die from covid-19 have ranged wildly from the tens to the hundreds of thousands. an emergency bill to tackle the virus, which has killed 104 people in britain, includes a number of measures the government says will \u201cstreamline the death management process.\u201d the measures include allowing funeral directors to register a death on behalf of a self-isolating family. deborah smith, a spokesperson for the national association of funeral directors, said the bill will help the profession \u201cpreserve the dignity of those who die and care for their bereaved families with compassion - even if they are not able to have the kind of funeral they would have wanted.\u201d smith would not be drawn on the expected numbers, but said \u201cfuneral directors are preparing for a variety of scenarios.\u201d one scenario is already playing out in wuhan. last month, a worker at the funeral home in hankou district, identifying himself only as huang, wrote an essay that was circulated on social media. he said funeral workers were as overwhelmed as the city\u2019s medics but had received less recognition. he said staff had worked without a break since the start of the epidemic. \u201csome of our employees don\u2019t even drink water because they need to go to the toilet and it\u2019s difficult to take off \nthe protective clothing,\u201d he wrote. half a world away, in the virus-stricken italian town of bergamo, funeral workers wage a near-identical struggle. \u201cit\u2019s like being in a war with an invisible enemy,\u201d said roberta caprini, a partner in centro funerario bergamasco, a funeral service in bergamo. \u201cwe\u2019ve been working without interruption for two weeks and sleeping 3-4 hours a night when we manage it. everyone in our area, us included, has lost someone or have someone sick in their home.\u201d bergamo\u2019s church of all saints has become a makeshift mortuary, its pews pushed aside to accommodate the dead. caprini said she had counted at least 60 coffins when she visited on tuesday. she spoke of the \u201creal torture\u201d felt by families who watched sick relatives taken away to hospital and never saw them again. her company has arranged video links to burials, to allow families to watch the priest bless the deceased. sometimes, she said, they drive the hearses past the bereaved family\u2019s home, so mourners \u201ccan at least come down at the moment and offer a quick prayer.\u201d (this story has been refiled to fix the bylines) ", "label": 1}, {"content": "coronavirus pandemic: pakistan reports third death as confirmed cases jump to 464. pakistan prime minister imran khan on friday asked people to self-quarantine for at least another 45 days as the country reported its third coronavirus death and the total number of confirmed cases rose to 464.\nthe third death was reported in pakistan's biggest city karachi, the capital of the southern sindh province which has reported the highest number of coronavirus cases in the country.\nsindh health minister azra fazal pechuho confirmed the death of a 77-year-old man and said the patient was a cancer survivor and had other medical problems like hypertension and diabetes but didn't have any travel or contact history.\nthe number of confirmed cases in sindh province rose to 245 on friday, provincial spokesman murtaza wahab said.\nshe said tests had been conducted on some 302 pilgrims who had returned to their hometown, sukkur from iran via the taftan border and 151 people tested positive for coronavirus.\nshe said three patients had also been cured and released from hospitals.\nearlier two patients died in khyber-pakhtunkhwa where the number of positive cases has increased to 23, provincial health minister taimur jhagra said.\nat least 16 more cases were reported in punjab where the tally touched 96, according to a notification issued by the provincial health department spokesperson qaiser asif.\nmore cases surfaced in balochistan where the number of infected persons is 81. another 23 were in gilgit-baltistan, two in islamabad and one in pakistan-occupied kashmir.\nprime minister khan while addressing the media in islamabad on friday said people should self-quarantine for at least another 45 days to help tackle the coronavirus crisis.\ncommenting on future course of action to contain the outbreak, khan said, \"our strategy is a little different from a complete lockdown, considering pakistan's socio-economic realities\".\n\"pakistan isn't a rich country like italy, where people can get through a sustained period without economic activity,\" he was quoted as saying by the express tribune.\nhe announced partial opening of border with afghanistan to let trucks pass carrying different supplies.\n\"despite global pandemic of covid 19, we remain committed to supporting our afghan brothers & sisters. i have given instructions to open the chaman-spinboldak border & let trucks crossover into afghanistan. in time of crisis, we remain steadfast with afghanistan,\" khan tweeted.\npakistan also sent 17 tonnes of cooked food to its stranded student in chinese city of wuhan, according to special assistant on information firdous ashiq awan.\n\"we thank the chinese government for taking care of the pakistanis in wuhan, just like their own citizens,\" awan said.\nas the financial problems of common people increased due to virus, the council of islamic ideology asked people to start doing charity even before the holy month of ramadan, which is due to start next month and when people are often more generous in giving alms.

paper submitted on march 2 to ssrn, a website run by the lancet for research that has not yet been published.   \"some common systemic symptoms of covid-19 such as fever, fatigue, phlegm and muscle pain were more prominent in patients admitted before january 23, but more insidious in later patients.\"   patients who tested positive for the virus after january 23 did not experience these symptoms as much. there was a 50 per cent decrease in fever, 70 per cent decline in fatigue and an 80 per cent drop in muscle pain, according to the paper. some of the 80 patients in the study could have been asymptomatic, it said.   according to the study, initial symptoms were milder after the lockdown was imposed, but there was no evidence that transmission or the pathogen had weakened. the doctors said the observations could be \"characteristics of virus mutation\".   as the virus spreads across the globe\u00a0\u2014 it has killed more than 4,600 people and infected over 123,000 so far\u00a0\u2014 researchers believe it will continue to evolve. in italy, for example\u00a0\u2014 the worst-hit country after china that is now also in lockdown\u00a0\u2014 the virus has been found to share genes that were detected earlier in germany but have not been seen in samples from china.   there has also been debate over the origins of the disease\u00a0\u2014 whether or not it originated in china\u00a0\u2014 and what genetic mutations could mean for prevention and control efforts.   a separate study by researchers from peking university and the chinese academy of sciences published on march 3 reached a similar conclusion on the effect of quarantines.   the team led by mr lu jian, a bioinformatics researcher at peking university, analysed genomic \nsequence data of the virus from 103 samples collected from patients in china and other countries. they found the earliest cases in wuhan might have evolved into two competing strains\u00a0\u2014 an earlier one and a newer \"more aggressive\" one.   the newer virus strain accounted for 96 per cent of the samples collected in early january, suggesting it was more infectious, according to the study published in the national science review.   but that more aggressive strain was less prevalent in samples from china and other countries taken after the initial outbreak in wuhan\u00a0\u2014 falling to about 60 per cent of the total.   the researchers attributed that change in the virus to the mass quarantines. \"these human intervention efforts might have caused severe selective pressure against the [aggressive] type,\" they wrote in the paper. \"if these changes are not due to sequencing errors, it would be interesting to test whether and how these mutations affect the transmission and pathogenesis of sars-cov-2,\" they added, referring to the clinical name for the virus.   another study led by mr jiang yongzhong from the hubei provincial centre for disease control and prevention also found that the virus had split into two major types, based on an analysis of 146 samples, according to a preprint paper on the biorxiv website on march 4.   it also said the genetic make-up of the virus had changed after quarantine measures were imposed, and mutations had \"occurred across the world \u2026 providing the possibility of widespread adaptation\".   mr paul young, head of the university of queensland's school of chemistry and molecular biosciences, said the coronavirus would acquire new, random mutations as it spread.   \"this is normal for a virus that contains an rna genome [like sars-cov-2]. they naturally acquire mutations as they replicate,\" he said.   \"most of these mutations, being random, have nothing to do with adaptation to the host and are simply a reflection of the high error rate in copying the viral genome.\"   the european centre for disease prevention and control said comparing the data from patients in italy to that of other places would provide a better understanding of the virus.   \"genomic information can support the identification of targets for treatment and vaccine development too, as well as the development of rapid diagnostic tests,\" a spokesperson for the centre said. \"in addition, by following the genomic changes over time, researchers can get the information on what happened to the virus in the past and foresee what can happen to it in the future.\"   but others noted that the studies on the virus' mutation were far from conclusive.   \"the hospital observation in wuhan, though valuable, must be treated with caution because it involved less than 100 patients,\" said a doctor at a public hospital in beijing treating virus patients who requested anonymity. \"whether quarantine measures could have had such a big\u00a0\u2014 and almost instant\u00a0\u2014 impact on the evolution of the virus \nremains unclear.\"   the peking university-led study was more controversial, with researchers from the university of glasgow asking mr lu to withdraw the paper to avoid spreading \"undue fear\". mr lu responded that the researchers had misinterpreted his team's conclusions.   whether the new virus strain now behaves like another coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome, or sars, and mutates itself out of existence in reaction to seasonal changes remains unclear. while researchers have suggested the spread of the virus could slow in warmer weather, the world health organisation and others warned there was no evidence it would be killed off by summer heat.   most scientists believe the virus originated in bats\u00a0\u2014 it shares more than 96 per cent of the genes of a coronavirus found in a bat species in yunnan province several years ago. but it would then have gone through hundreds of mutations before it became the virus that causes covid-19, normally accumulating at a rate of one to two mutations a month. so the virus could have left the bat more than a decade ago, or it could have merged with new genes on an unknown intermediate host.   according to mr wu yonghua, a scientist at northeast normal university in changchun, the new coronavirus could be just the latest in an army of diseases to come.   mr wu has studied the evolution of the new strain, as well as sars\u00a0\u2014 which is also believed to have jumped from bats to another animal\u00a0\u2014 and more than 30 other coronaviruses found in bats.   at least 10 of them were evolving on paths that could eventually mirror the same course as the new coronavirus and sars, developing the same protein spike that would allow it to effectively bind with human cells, according to wu's preprint paper on biorxiv on march 5.   \"[they] may be potential novel coronaviruses that will infect humans in the future,\" he said.

bigger, you'd expect the billions would be much bigger.\" \n while difficult to pinpoint a precise cost as the crisis is still unfolding, the impact will be experienced mostly through changes in \"human psychology\", he said. \"panic is what seems to be the biggest drain on the economy, rather than deaths.\" \n markets have been whipsawed by panic, paris-based amundi asset management said in a jan 29 note. chief investment officer pascal blanque and his deputy vincent mortier said the outbreak provided the trigger for a pause in a stock-market rally that began in october. prof mckibbin's forecasts are in line with those of other analysts. \n nomura international expects the blow to china's growth could exceed that seen during the sars outbreak. real gross domestic product (gdp) growth in the first quarter could \"materially drop\" from the 6 per cent pace in the fourth quarter, maybe by even more than the 2 percentage point deceleration seen in the second quarter of 2003 from the first, nomura economists wrote in a report to clients. \n bloomberg economists chang shu, jamie rush and tom orlik said: \"back in 2003, china accounted for just 4 per cent of global gdp. fast forward to 2020, and its share has increased to 17 per cent. that means the global spillover if china's growth slumps will be larger. \n \"hong kong stands out as the most exposed - our simulation shows a hit of 1.7 percentage points (ppt) in the first quarter. south korea and vietnam would also suffer, each slowing by 0.4 ppt. japan would take a 0.2 ppt hit.\" \n more contagious than sars but less deadly so far, the insidious nature of the new coronavirus, dubbed 2019-ncov, is such that it often presents as mild cold-like symptoms and can go undetected, which could potentially mean a protracted crisis that is longer than the 2003 epidemic. \n the new virus, which emerged in central china late last year, is reported to have infected almost 10,000 people in two months, eclipsing the 8,096 sars cases reported from november 2002 through 2003, when the contagion spread from china across south-east asia and to north america and europe. \n \"if a country had a bad epidemiological outcome, then their shocks were likely be a lot bigger than countries that were able to control it well,\" prof mckibbin said, referring to his findings from examining the impact of sars. \n bloomberg ", "label": 1},

it looked like any other day in the historic, prosperous central china metropolis of 11 million people.   that sense evaporated in the evening as mr zhang watched renowned epidemiologist zhong nanshan issue a sobering warning in a tv interview. a new form of viral pneumonia was showing signs of spreading among people in the city and had already sickened a number of medical workers, professor zhong said.   \"i felt something was wrong,\" mr zhang said.   his plans as a tourist abruptly changed early on the morning of jan\u00a023. news popped up on his\u00a0phone that the wuhan government would lock down the city in several hours for disease control, halting all outbound air, rail and bus services. mr zhang quickly packed and rushed to the main railway station.   \"i am just a tourist,\" he\u00a0told caixin before he boarded a train back home to beijing. \"i don't want to be trapped in this dangerous city.\"   about 5km away, infectious disease doctor zhao lei at the wuhan union hospital was exhausted by the sudden surge of patients over the past month. since late december, people with fevers and pneumonia-like symptoms had been flooding in, forcing the hospital to expand the fever clinic.   \"shutting down the city was no surprise as it is an effective way to prevent disease from spreading,\" dr zhao said.   but there was no precedent worldwide for putting a city as big as wuhan under complete quarantine.   over hundreds of years, wuhan, the capital of hubei province, has played a critical role in central china as an economic and transportation hub connecting major parts of the country via an extensive network of road, railway and water routes on the yangtze river. during the qing dynasty, wuhan was known as the \"thoroughfare to nine provinces\".   for most of wuhan's residents, nothing seemed unusual, although word was circulating about a mysterious disease. as the quarantine order fell and more timely information was published, they found themselves at the epicentre of a new pandemic caused by\u00a0a\u00a0novel coronavirus, or 2019-ncov. although the origin of the deadly virus has not been clearly confirmed, it is believed to have spread from wuhan to the rest of china and around the world.   things moved quickly after the quarantine order. three days after wuhan cut itself off from the outside, it halted all public transport inside the city. in six days, almost all other cities in hubei imposed similar lockdowns. by jan\u00a029, all of the 31 provincial-level regions in the chinese mainland enacted top-level emergency responses to the virus. more than 6,000 medical workers have been dispatched from across the country to wuhan.   but the measures have yet to stop the virus from spreading. casualty numbers continued rocketing over the past week. as of saturday, 11,821 coronavirus infections were confirmed across china with \na death toll of 259. hubei alone reported 7,153 confirmed cases and 249 deaths, including 192 in wuhan. the virus has also spread globally as 134 cases have been confirmed in 23 countries, spurring several countries to impose travel bans on china.   on thursday, the united nations' world health organisation (who) declared the coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency while emphasising its confidence in china's capacity to control the outbreak. who director-general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus praised china's efforts to contain the outbreak, saying he had never seen a nation respond so aggressively to a disease.   since the wuhan lockdown, many major chinese cities have sought to contain the virus by restricting transit or extending the chinese\u00a0new year holidays. streets in many cities, including beijing, were deserted during the normally convivial holiday, as people were encouraged to stay home. medical experts say they think the coronavirus has an incubation period of as long as 14 days, so strict limits on movement of for at least two weeks from the wuhan lockdown will be a crucial measure for containing the disease.   now china is fighting a war against the virus, which has cost the economy heavily and disrupted the lives of ordinary people, especially those in wuhan. as the country gradually recovers from the shock and fear inspired by the virus, many questioned why the virus crisis spread so quickly in wuhan and whether there was any chance of a better outcome.   word circulated online since late december that a mysterious pneumonia was spreading in wuhan, recalling chinese people's painful memory of the sars epidemic in 2003, which claimed nearly 800 lives.   on dec\u00a030, a document from wuhan's public health authority went viral on the internet, confirming that the city's hospitals had received a rising number of patients who showed pneumonia-like symptoms. all the patients had contact with the south china seafood wholesale market in downtown wuhan, according to the document.   established in 2003, the 30,000 sq m\u00a0market accommodates more than 1,000 merchants selling a wide range of farm products and seafood. the market supplies almost all the restaurants in wuhan and neighboring areas.   \"without the market, the whole catering industry in wuhan would stop,\" a vendor told caixin.   it is widely believed that the market, which is home to a grey market for trade in wild animals, is also where the virus started its journey around the world.   on dec\u00a031, the wuhan city government for the first time disclosed that 27 pneumonia cases were confirmed in the city, including seven severe cases and two recoveries. caixin learnt\u00a0that on the same day, a group of epidemic prevention workers were sent to the seafood market for disinfection, and a team of public health experts from the national health commission arrived at wuhan to investigate the mysterious disease.   the next morning, a notice posted at the south china seafood market ordered it to be \nclosed for \"environmental and sanitation rectification.\" as vendors packed to leave, unease grew among them about a rumored epidemic.   \"the seafood market has been known for its dirty environment for years,\" said a resident living nearby. \"there is always the smell of seafood and dead poultry,\"    the inner courtyard of the wuhan\u00a0huanan\u00a0seafood wholesale market, believed to be the centre of the mysterious pneumonia outbreak. st photo: jet chen   people familiar with the south china seafood market know that it is not only a place to find a rich variety of seafood but also exotic wild animals sold by vendors in deep corners of the market.   there have always been vendors \"selling snakes, pheasants, giant salamanders, crocodiles and hares\", said a merchant at the market. most of the wild animal vendors were located at the western part of the market, the merchant said.   trading certain wild animals, including live ones, is prohibited by chinese laws and industry regulations. although market authorities conduct regular inspections and impose heavy fines on violators, sales of wild animals at the market have never been stopped in the past decade, vendors told caixin.   according to research published on jan\u00a026 by the chinese centre for disease control and prevention (cdc), 33 among 585 environmental samples extracted from the market tested positive for the virus. of the positive samples, 93.9 per cent\u00a0came from the western part of the market.   the cdc later reported that the new coronavirus was very likely passed from certain wild animals to humans at the south china seafood market and then evolved into human-to-human transmission.   while all eyes are on the seafood market, some experts said the situation may be more complicated. an essay published by the lancet medical journal said that while wild animals are the most likely source of the virus, there was more than one venue where the virus was passed to humans. the essay, penned by doctors at wuhan jinyintan hospital, found that only 27 of the first 41 patients diagnosed with the coronavirus infection in wuhan had contact with the south china seafood market.   \"now it seems clear that (the) seafood market is not the only origin of the virus,\" said dr cao bin, one of the essay's authors quoted by scienceinsider, a publication of the 172-year-old american association for the advancement of science. \"but to be honest, we still do not know where the virus came from.\"   doctors on the front lines of epidemic outbreaks always sense the danger ahead.   dr zhao lei at the infectious disease department of the wuhan union hospital said he received the first patient suspected with coronavirus infection in december. the patient's pneumonia symptoms were quite unusual, and a ct scan showed shadows in his lungs, dr zhao said. although ct scan results are not the only reference for coronavirus diagnosis, they are a key indicator.   in the following days, patients with similar symptoms started to flood into the \nhospital, sometimes reaching 800 or 900 in one day, dr zhao said. the hospital had to transfer more doctors and nurses to the fever clinic to treat the influx of patients.   several doctors raised concerns of a new strain of virus that showed stronger contagion and severity than normal respiratory infections, but they were confused by the healthcare authorities' hesitance to take measures and official statements declaring the disease controllable.   mr li yunhua (a pseudonym), a radiologist at the hubei xinhua hospital in wuhan, said he first heard of some patients with sars-like symptoms in his hospital dec\u00a030. that night, mr li received messages from an online chat group of doctor colleagues in several wuhan hospitals who warned of a new epidemic emerging in the city.   but the next day, mr li said he felt a little relieved when the wuhan health authority issued a public statement saying there were 27 confirmed pneumonia cases with no sign of human-to-human transmission. no medical worker had been infected, according to the statement.   the following day, wuhan police said eight people were punished for spreading rumours online. the eight were mostly doctors who sent disease warnings in mr li's chat group. the punishment muted many doctors, although more of them sensed the danger of the disease, mr li said.   the wuhan government suspended updating the infection numbers between jan\u00a05 and jan\u00a010 during a meeting of provincial lawmakers. when briefings resumed jan\u00a011, the government again said there were no medical worker infections or evidence of human-to-human transmission, while reporting that the number of infections declined to 41.   \"all doctors in our hospital knew it was not right as it was so different from what we'd seen,\" said a doctor at a large public hospital in wuhan on condition of anonymity.   a radiologist at another public hospital also raised doubts about the official statistics.   \"on jan\u00a015, i found 50 cases (with lung infections shown on ct scan), but the health commission still reported 41, unchanged from jan\u00a011,\" he said.   mr li noticed an infection on jan\u00a06 in a ct scan of a respiratory doctor in his hospital. the doctor had never been to the south china seafood market, mr li said. but officials at the hospital ordered doctors to not disclose any information to the public or the media, mr li said.   he was shocked by the surge of patients with lung infections. since jan\u00a03, \"it started at two to three per day and increased to four to five the next day, and then the number doubled every three to four days\", mr li\u00a0said. on jan\u00a018, he\u00a0read 86 ct scans with lung infections, and after that more than 100 cases every day.   \"i've never seen a virus grow so quickly,\" mr li said. \"the speed is stunning.\"    citizens waiting for\u00a0medical\u00a0attention at a hospital in\u00a0wuhan, the chinese

lungs were infected,\" mr li said. mr liang was transferred to jinyintan hospital jan\u00a018 and died a week later.   it wasn't until jan\u00a020 when prof zhong nanshan confirmed infections of 14 medical workers on the tv interview that the public became aware of the risk of human-to-human transmission.   the next day, the wuhan municipal health commission for the first time confirmed that 15 medical workers were infected. but sources close to the matter said the actual number was much higher.   mr li told caixin that as of jan\u00a029, more than 30 medical workers at his hospital were suspected of being infected.   on jan\u00a028, china's supreme court corrected the wuhan police's punishment of the eight people who first flagged the danger of the coronavirus outbreak online. in a statement published on its social media account, the top court said: \"if the 'rumour' was heard by the public and led some of them to start protection, we would be in a better position of disease control.\"   a research report jointly published by the cdc and the hubei disease prevention and control centre on jan\u00a029 said evidence showed that the new coronavirus started passing from patients to their close contacts in mid-december.   mr xie zuoliang, 69, said he felt muscle pain and had a fever on jan\u00a018 after he returned from a photography show in downtown wuhan. a friend with him also had a fever.   the next day, mr xie went to wuhan xinhua hospital for a ct scan and it\u00a0showed infection in his lungs. doctor told him only designated hospitals could admit patients with fever at that time according to city government's new policy.   early jan\u00a020, mr xie arrived at the wuhan union hospital in hopes of seeing a doctor but found hundreds of people queuing up ahead of him. he gave up waiting after five hours.   the next morning, mr xie rushed to another designated hospital - wuhan xinhua hospital - but was again stopped by the long queue. a busy nurse told him the hospital was full.   on jan\u00a022, he said his hopes rose after hearing news that the wuhan government cleared more medical facilities to receive patients suspected of coronavirus infection. he went to the red cross hospital but was shocked by the chaos - desperate patients angrily shouting at doctors, while exhausted medical staff could barely hold themselves up. a young doctor cried out to his supervisor begging for a break.   \"i felt both doctors and patients were in despair,\" mr xie said.   he got some prescription medication after seven hours of waiting but was told there was no room for him to be hospitalised. failing to find a taxi, mr xie walked more than an hour back home in the middle of the night.   medical staff in protective suits treating a\u00a0patient\u00a0with

caused by the frequent policy changes by city health authorities, causing confusion to patients and institutions, mr li said. but more importantly, it reflected how the government and the public were stunned by the fast-spreading virus after the long absence of true information. mr li said he feels guilty for not disclosing the truth to the public.   \"doctors and disease prevention officials have known how serious it is, but none dared to speak out,\" mr li said. \"we worked days and nights to race with death to save the patients...\u00a0they should have avoided such pain.\"   qin jianxing,

experts have highlighted challenges with the covid-19 coronavirus epidemic, with the world health organization (who) warning of the risk of outbreaks coming back to life and researchers in mainland china and hong kong pointing out a major difficulty with diagnosis.   the alerts came on friday (feb 28) as the who declared that the risk of global spread of the coronavirus epidemic had become \"very high\" \u2014 though the un health agency stopped short of calling it a pandemic.   in a joint study published in the new england journal of medicine, researchers from mainland china and hong kong reviewed the cases of 1,099 coronavirus patients from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces.   they found that more than half the patients did not have a fever when they went into hospital, making diagnosis more difficult. but 88.7 per cent of them did develop one after admission.   \"some patients with covid-19 do not have fever or radiologic abnormalities on initial presentation, which has complicated the diagnosis,\" the study said, referring to the disease caused by the coronavirus.   the study was co-authored by dozens of medical experts, including dr zhong nanshan, director of china's state key laboratory of respiratory diseases, and chinese university of hong kong respiratory medicine expert professor david hui shu-cheong.   so far, the epidemic has killed 2,835 people on the mainland, with 47 more fatalities on saturday. mainland china has 79,251 infections, with 39,002 patients recovered.   more cases have also been reported in south korea, italy and iran, prompting the us centres for disease control and prevention to raise its travel advisory for italy and iran, recommending travellers avoid all non-essential trips to those countries due to \"limited access to adequate medical care in affected areas\".   in a report, also released on friday, the who said it was convinced that china's containment measures were effective as the number of new cases had continued to fall.   it also said that epidemiologists were convinced that the coronavirus that caused the disease now known as covid-19 was caused by an organism spread from animals. bats appeared to be the reservoir of the virus, but the intermediate host had not yet been identified.   without identifying that animal chain, there was a risk that outbreaks could recur in areas where they had receded, the un health agency warned.   the report was compiled by a team of more than two dozen specialists from china and overseas who were part of a nine-day who trip to beijing, and guangdong, sichuan and hubei provinces from february 16.   it gave an overview of the trip, assessed the response to the epidemic and identified next steps for china and other countries to take.   the team concluded that in china, human-to-human transmission of the virus occurred largely within households. among 344 clusters in southern china's guangdong province and sichuan \nin the southwest, 78 to 85 per cent occurred within families.   though transmission also occurred in hospitals and other closed settings, transmission in these places did not appear to be a major feature of the virus in china, it said.   as of feb 20, there were 2,055 confirmed cases among health workers from 476 hospitals across the country, 88 per cent of which were in hubei province.   but most of the cases among medical workers were identified early in the outbreak in wuhan when supplies and experience were lower. in some later cases, medical workers may have been infected within the household rather than in a health care setting, it said.   quoting from the guangdong provincial centre for disease control and prevention, the study said that as of feb 20, the coronavirus could be detected in upper respiratory samples one or two days before symptoms.   it said that so far the best prevention measure was to keep a safe distance from other people, minimising close contact in public places, but the risk of more cases was rising as work resumed and movement restrictions were lifted.   amid criticism that chinese authorities were slow to respond to the health crisis, communist party journal qiushi published on saturday a speech by chinese president xi jinping dated feb 5.   in it, mr xi lashes out at some local governments for their failure to impose adequate prevention and control efforts.   mr xi said party committees and governments at all levels actively carried out prevention and control work under the central government's leadership, but some local governments took inappropriate measures and changed policies frequently.   \"in some places, there were even crimes that seriously impeded prevention and control work, and the public is dissatisfied with that,\" he said, adding that containment efforts were at a critical moment.   as part of its response, the defence ministry said it would suspend some major military exercises.   \"since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, the military has been focused on epidemic prevention and control while also ... seeking to minimise the impact to our military training,\" ministry spokesman wu qian said, giving no details of the affected exercises.   mr hui, one of the co-authors of the joint study, also called for more tests to be conducted in private and public clinics to enable early detection and isolation of suspected cases.   the virus has so far infected 94 people in hong kong, killing two. however, no new infections were reported on saturday.   mr hui, who sits on a covid-19 government advisory panel reporting directly to the city's leader, said that even though the patients' mortality rate was lower than the 2-3 per cent mortality rate of patients with flu infections, the figure was still significant. \"the virus is highly contagious, so a 1.4 per cent mortality rate still means a substantial number of deaths.\"   more countries have started imposing preventive measures such as school

since 2003 as the deadly coronavirus outbreak could deprive the region\u2019s airlines of us$27.8 billion (s$39 billion) in revenues, according to the global airline trade body. \n the international air transport association (iata) unveiled its first comprehensive forecast on thursday (feb 20) showing the negative effect the disease, known as covid-19, would have on air travel. \n asia-pacific airlines would suffer the most, experiencing a 13 per cent decline in full-year passenger demand. as large numbers of people opt not to travel to and within the region, major airlines like cathay pacific, singapore airlines and qantas have been forced to cut their flight schedules, affecting their profitability. \n iata said the worldwide revenue deficit would top us$29.3 billion, with us$12.8 billion shed in the collapsing chinese domestic market. mainland carriers lost a combined us$3.1 billion on international flights in 2018, relying on domestic services to prop up their expansionist ambitions. \n \u201cthese are challenging times for the global air transport industry,\u201d said mr alexandre de juniac, iata\u2019s director general and ceo. \u201cthe sharp downturn in demand as a result of covid-19 will have a financial impact on airlines \u2014 severe for those particularly exposed to the china market.\u201d \n he said airlines faced tough choices on cutting back flight schedules or routes outright. losses would be mitigated by lower fuel costs through reduced flying. \n \u201cthis will be a very tough year for airlines,\u201d added mr de juniac. \n iata\u2019s estimates are based on a \u201cquick recovery\u201d, akin to the resurgence in demand for flights after the 2003 sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak, which resulted in a sharp decline in air travel for six months. at that time, sars caused the only annual decline in asia-pacific traffic in almost two decades. \n iata said demand for flights in 2020 would likely fall by 4.7 per cent. with its predicted growth of 4.1 per cent last december, global demand is expected to contract by 0.6 per cent. \n of the us$581 billion in passenger revenue that airlines were expected to generate in 2020, according to iata\u2019s december forecast, the projected loss of us$29.3 billion amounts to a 5 per cent decline. \n in asia, a region that has outpaced all others with its soaring appetite for travel, the impact is more severe. the region is expected to swing from 4.8 per cent growth to a contraction of 8.2 per cent. \n qantas said earlier on thursday that it would cut flight schedules in asia by 15 per cent, with the equivalent of 18 aircraft being grounded. the coronavirus outbreak will cost the airline a$150 million (s$139 million) through to the end of june. \n air france-klm warned that the virus would wipe \u20ac200 million (s$302 million) off its earnings by april, but was braced for an escalation in losses if china flights did not resume by then. fellow european airline group lufthansa said it had grounded 13 jets as a result of halting flights to china. \n singapore airlines and cathay pacific both warned on profits, with each carrier cutting flight schedules to conserve cash. \n iata said it was too early to tell what impact the loss of revenue would mean for airline profitability. \n further highlighting the fragility of its estimates, iata said the projected impact of covid-19 assumes that the centre of the public health emergency remains in china. \u201cif it spreads more widely to asia-pacific markets, then impacts on airlines from

A week later, researchers identified a novel virus as the cause: they called it 2019-NCOV. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. Meanwhile, it is known as SARS COV-2 (COV stands for coronavirus, SARS for a respiratory disease triggered by a similar pathogen). SARS-COV-2 could have spread from a food market in Wuhan. There, exotic animals like reptiles were also sold. The lung disease that can trigger the new virus is now referred to as COVID-19 (English for coronavirus disease; Coronavirus disease).

She works in China and Germany. In this time-online series, she reports critical about life, culture and everyday life in China. To protect your professional and private environment, she writes under a pseudonym. There are many stories in these weeks in China. One of the most common is: as a helper in Shiyan stood in the province of Hubei in front of an apartment, a six-year-old boy opened the door. The helpers would have asked him how many people are in the apartment. Only grandpa and me, the boy said. Where grandpa was? That's dead, he had died a few days ago. Horrified the helpers asked the boy why he did not get started and helped help. Because grandpa had said he should not leave the apartment. Outside there is a dangerous virus. Therefore, he had stayed at home and had nourished by biscuits. He carefully hidden the dead grandfather under a duvet. The authorities present the events in that apartment in Shiyan differently. It is impossible for the dead days located unnoticed there, helpers sill the residents every day. This is officially your order, but whether you really fulfill him (can), can not be verified. Unsativity, however, is the worst situation in many cities in the province of Hubei, which has long been distinguished from the outside world through their extensive breakdown, one gives less attention than the in Wuhan, the provincial capital and the world's first epicenter of the Covid-19 outbreak . In February, around 800 million people in a variety of ways were under quarantine throughout China - this is about one and a half times the EU's population. In Hubei, especially in Wuhan, the suffering of people was greatest. Since January 23, nine million people have been valued in the city, they spend most of their time in isolation today. Many other cities, small towns and villages are followed by the example of Wuhan, after the Chinese President Xi Jinping at the beginning of February has called the \"People's War\" against the virus. The World Health Organization WHO praised the success of the measures. But how independent does she do that, and are really all funds right when it comes to a pandemic? The Chinese government has limited the freedom of movement of the population with great effort and started it comprehensively to control. Using technology and high human use of officials, policemen, social workers. They have become supervisor. A wide range of tasks has been allocated to you: to ensure the roads for order, to take all the trips and contact persons in all households, regularly to measure at all fever, the people who are under quarantine, to provide food daily, to forbid everyday , without \nTo assemble or assume the protective mask or to leave the apartment at all. In a short time, many emergency workers can be mobilized, is one of the great strengths of the communist government and was also praised by some observers abroad. However, in such a tremendous power structure designed to satisfy the top lead, instead of serving the population, has a top-down policy like this a high price. From the first day of Wuhan's restraint, many people from Hubei were suddenly no longer welcome with their fellow citizens. A new caste of untouchable was created. The happier ones were housed in comfortable quarantine hotels from Hubei, for example in Chengdu and Sanya, and then found friendly landlords. But many unfortunates suffered as a veritable exile in their own country. The amount of stories from everyday life with Covid-19 in China is barely manageable. The stories, although some are not ultimately verify, together, together a great narrative of life with the virus under state control. A truck driver had to wander on the streets for seven trucks, recognizable from Hubei trucks, to sleep in the car and eat instant noodles. Whenever he parked his truck to make a nap, he was chased by local \"officials\" until the police discovered him and give him a parking lot to sleep. Families from Hubei with grandparents and small children on family visit in other provinces were expelled and mistaken over the highways. In many areas, families were included with visit from Hubei in their homes, sometimes they nailed the doors without considering what should be from them in the case of a fire. Many guest workers had to sleep on the street when they came back to the cities in which they usually found work - no hotel took them up, and there was no work anymore. Also, people from other regions that festate after the lock in Wuhan landed on the street when they could not afford a hotel. Some could help volunteers or the city administration - the others sought protection in underpasses in ice-cold weather. They could neither leave the city, nor return to their workplace or find in Wuhan work. Volunteers finally organized accommodation for you. These are just the stories with Happy End, who randomly came to the public. The inhabitants of Wuhans and other areas of quarantined areas experienced a state that combined planning management methods of revolutionary sixties with state-of-the-art surveillance technology. Social workers interviewed people after they had contact and where they had been everywhere. They controlled \nEveryone, whether he or she had fever; And then handled a permit, which was checked every one to three days every household. This permit could be an improvised card, sometimes just a password or a QR code. Thus, every household was allowed to send a person for shopping of the most necessary supplies. In addition, the wearing of a protective mask was also in many places, if you left the house or entered a supermarket. To avoid this blockade, a woman in Wuhan has climbed down to the facade of her house ten floors; Neighbors recorded the Herozat. When she came back with a bag of meat, she was caught and insulted by the security guard. From February 20 to Tech Giants such as Alibaba and Tencent helped the administrations of better guided cities in the development of color-coded systems to classify people based on their health and movement patterns. Red, yellow and green, citizens sent via app to the smartphone, each were no quarantine for two weeks, one-week or no quarantine. On the countless control points, which had been established at home entrances, you had to scan his code before being transmitted. However, this system was not very reliable: in social media, many complained, their code sometimes suddenly turns green on red or yellow, although they never left the apartment. People demonstrated the watchmen in front of their homes as evidence of the few steps, which had recorded fitness apps on their smartphones, or evidence of online orders and deliveries. Nevertheless, the bureaucracy had no view, she did not recognize anything else than the code. A research of New York Times also revealed that the code software allows the transfer of personal data of the controlled directly to the police. The authors of the Netflix grusel series Black Mirror find here safely for new episodes. Who does not fit, is insulted, beaten or fixed and locked with other suspected cases in a quarantine center. In China, the videos are held in social media, documenting violent attacks militant authorities. You can see how even old people are beaten and getting into soil, just because they are on the road without protective masks. A video shows a young woman in the province of Gouizho, which was tied out of the same reason and put to pillory. Even a harmless game like Mah-Jongg, which is played around a table, was prohibited. In the Autonomous Guangxi area, people who disregarded the ban adhered to each other and publicly humiliated. Even a family playing in the district Xiaochang of the province Hubei at home Mah-Jongg was attacked; Service-fitting official smashed their table. Throughout China, there were such incidents, in the cities as in the countryside. \nIn the older generation, memories of the worst moments of communist rule were awake in China. Even if you followed Brav to all rules, life was last not necessarily easier. If you did not have a protective mask, you sat hard at home, and protective masks were barely to get. Initially, people have ordered food and other important goods at online subject services. But soon it was banned the supplier in some cities to enter buildings. Instead, the government was sold in limited quantities online carepacks - at prices, which often were many times over normal prices, and in poor quality. Private companies were not approved. Farmers from Shandong Province, who wanted to sell food to a city in Hubei were arrested and occupied with a fine. And what was actually from the masses of foods donated to the province Hubei of companies and farmers from all over China? Some achieved hospitals, different landed at the city administrations and the police, the rest was sold or even destroyed. \"I'm hungry, simple. Only. Hunger,\" wrote me a young woman from Wuhan. A young man from there told me, his family must first live by bread alone. When in the most recently quarantined cities of Hubei province, the few officially approved grocery stores and supermarkets, people dramed desperately, for fear, nothing to be removed. For many older people who are lacking the technical knowledge or equipment, ordering online foods, it was about survival. Anyone who is too old or too weak to claim himself in the presence was dependent on their own children, of neighbors or brave volunteers. The latter tried to close the huge gaps between the needs of simple people and the lousy care by the government. In Wuhan, where public transport was set, the voluntary doctors and sisters to work - taxi drivers had too much fear of infection. Volunteers used pets whose owners were locked out of the city, and brought about AIDS patients who were no longer treated by the hospitals. They also delivered food for homeless and tried to get these accommodations. Some volunteers have infected themselves with the virus at their service and died. Some have also infected their families with Covid-19 and also died because no hospital bed was provided for them. People have tried with all power to maintain something like normality in recent weeks and months - in a world in which nothing was normal. Some suddenly turned into great chefs (and boasted social media with their achievements). \nOthers spent more time with their children (and now also boasted these). While the schools were closed throughout China, still had to be learned. Teachers found themselves overnight in Internet Influencer transformed: They taught online and sometimes were interrupted on a very funny way of their families; Sports instructors invented new forms of carpentry; Some schools even tried to stream the all-round hits of the banner live. On the stock market, the stock prices for online conference and teaching software have gone through the ceiling. But always, the attempt failed to maintain normality. Because a family member of the virus was diseased, rejected by overloaded hospitals and quarantine centers and stayed without treatment. Because a chronic illness like diabetes or high blood pressure, with which one can live under normal circumstances, suddenly became fatal. Because the treatment options were removed by overloading the hospitals. The website wuhancrisis.com gather thousands of social media posts - help calls that fell victim to censorship. For another group people there is no normal quality for two months: for medical staff. About 30,000 doctors, nurses should have come to Wuhan to support their colleagues on site. According to the last official statistics, around 2,000 members of the medical professions have been infected with the coronavirus in China in the exercise of their activities. Many believe that the real numbers are far higher. Since the end of February after the first avoidable chaos, the thousands of people has cost their lives, for the survivors slowly actually once again a kind of everyday life. But it is a forced, no natural. The Aberillions, whom one's own human tragedies have reliably experienced, who have experienced the brutality of the official abuse of power and traumatized from their factual imprisonment, can not just do so as nothing happens. Many people now return to their jobs. The own empty purse forces them to often press the pressure of the government. Once, Mao demanded victims from the Chinese women for the \"big leap forward\". In 2020, today's Government Xi Jinpings demands from them in the fight against Covid-19. And he will go on, the Klugen Chinese women and Chinese know exactly. Yes, in Wuhan seems the worst over. But people will not be blazing from the announcements, according to which there are no new start-ups in so many Chinese provinces as well as sorcery. They will not have escaped that in Liaoning officials were fired after they reported a new case in their county. In China, it could actually be one \ngive new normality. A silence, displacement and smoldering fear. Some people will also belong to anger. One who was sparked on the experience of how little own government's life and the rights of their citizens are really worth.

the virus spreads from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth via coughing or sneezing, according to the world health organization (who). it can persist on most surfaces up to several days, so in addition to directly inhaling the virus, you can become infected by touching something that has been contaminated and then touching your own nose, mouth or eyes. there is some evidence that virus particles in the feces of an infected person can transmit the disease through contact, but that remains unconfirmed. how many people are infected, and how many do not show any symptoms? so far, more than 550,000 cases have been reported worldwide, of which more than 127,000 have recovered and more than 24,000 have died. some researchers estimate that up to 80% of people who are infected show no or only mild symptoms and may not even know they are sick. that would put the number of people who might have been infected in the millions. but we need many more studies and much more testing to close in on a more accurate number. are younger people less likely to die from the virus? younger people, while less vulnerable, can still develop covid-19 - the disease caused by the sars-cov-2 coronavirus - severe enough to require hospitalization. just how much safer they are is still unanswered. the who says older people with pre-existing conditions - such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, high blood pressure, diabetes and heart disease - appear to develop serious illness more often than others, while a u.s. health official said the mortality rate in males appears to be twice that of women in every age group. health officials have cautioned that anyone with those underlying conditions, as well as those with weakened immune systems, are at increased risk. can people be re-infected? this is a key question \u2013 and we don\u2019t yet know the answer. there are a handful of cases of possible \u201creinfection\u201d in recovered patients. but most scientists believe those are more likely to have been relapses. a patient may feel better and test negative for the virus in their nose and throat, while the virus remains elsewhere in their body. fully recovered patients have antibodies in their blood that should protect them from fresh infection, but we don\u2019t know how long those antibodies will last. with some viruses, antibodies fade faster. even if they do persist, \nsars-cov-2 might undergo small changes over time, as flu viruses do each year, rendering the antibodies ineffective. several academic laboratories and medical companies are looking to produce blood tests to figure out who has been exposed to the virus and whether some people have developed immunity. serological testing will also give a better picture of the full extent of the pandemic. do we know when there will be treatments or a vaccine? no. so far there are no vaccines or antiviral medicines specific to the new coronavirus. treatment for now focuses on relieving symptoms such as breathing assistance. companies around the world are racing to develop vaccines. a few have launched early safety testing in humans, but experts say it could take a year or more to develop and test a vaccine. another complication: viruses can mutate quickly. some scientists have already identified subtle changes since sars-cov-2 emerged in wuhan, china, in december. but recent studies show the virus is relatively stable, which suggests vaccines should still be effective when they become available. does the virus spread more slowly in hot places? some experts had hoped that the onset of summer will naturally slow the virus. but the european centre for disease control said on wednesday that it is unlikely to diminish its spread. the who has also said that the virus can be transmitted in all areas, including hot and humid climates. how long will the pandemic last? we don\u2019t know. it will depend on a range of factors, from how long people continue to isolate and avoid group gatherings to when effective drugs or a vaccine become available. president donald trump said this week that he hopes to \u201creopen\u201d the u.s. economy by easter sunday on april 12. but he has faced criticism that such a timetable is too rushed and could lead to more people dying. in hubei province, the epicenter of china\u2019s coronavirus outbreak, life has started to return to normal after two months of lockdown. it remains to be seen whether such a return to normal spurs another outbreak. does the amount of exposure to the virus determine how sick someone gets? viruses enter the body and infect cells, using them as factories to make many millions of copies of themselves, so the number of virus particles that first enter the body has little effect on the eventual amount of virus in the system. at the same time, more frequent exposure does increase the chance that the virus will enter the body in the first place. when will the economy return to normal? the international monetary fund expects the pandemic will cause a global recession in 2020 that could be worse than the one triggered by the 2008 financial crisis. the depth of a recession, how long it will last and the nature of the recovery are a matter of debate. economists say it will largely depend on how long the lockdowns last \u2013 around a quarter of all humanity is currently in lockdown \u2013 and how far government support goes in helping individuals, businesses \nand markets survive the crisis. are the trillions of dollars in emergency spending helping? central bank measures have sought to keep financial markets functioning, including areas that keep the real economy humming, such as the markets where companies go to raise short term cash to pay staff and where cities go to raise money for roads and schools. steps taken by governments, such as the $2 trillion u.s. stimulus package, are expected to further help the economy by putting cash in the hands of individuals and providing additional funding to small businesses and companies. such measures still need to work through the system, however, and it remains unclear whether they will be enough. is it a good time to invest? some investors and bank strategists are starting to look at whether people should buy back into the world\u2019s stock markets, which have plunged some 25% from their highs in february. u.s. hedge fund manager bill ackman said this week he had turned increasingly positive on stocks and credit and was \u201credeploying our capital in companies we love at bargain prices that are built to withstand this crisis.\u201d but with all the uncertainties, many more analysts and investors remain shy about calling the bottom of the market.

That in the last 14 days they were in China and other countries with the presence of the virus.

Dur\u00e1n also explained that, until now, the measures to prevent the disease are those of personal protection because it is a disease of respiratory transmission for which there is still no effective treatment. Until now, \"a symptomatic treatment\" is applied, the specialist detailed because fever and cough are treated, although since yesterday he circulates an article where the good results of a combination of an antiviral with an antiretroviral, but that treatment It is in the test phase in patients.

But to date, there are no cases of Coronavirus in Cuba. Preventive measures of Cuba The measure of isolating people with symptoms similar to those of the disease and from countries in which coronavirus has been detected, is part of the strategy traced by the Cuban Government to prevent the entry of this suffering from Cuba .

Faced with this reality and the fact that to date there is still no effective medication to control the symptoms and contagion person to person of the disease, our country, which up to date does not report any case of this mortal virus, it is proposed, As explained by the Ministry of Public Health, to keep the risk of introduction and dissemination of the Coronavirus in the national territory and minimize the negative effects of an epidemic in the health of the population and its impact on the economic-social sphere.

Likewise, it has been determined that these measures have to be implemented not only by public health, but also by other agencies of the central administration of the State, for which a temporary work group has been created for the direction of prevention actions and Preparation before the new Coronavirus.

(laughs) i haven\u2019t been to school for a year, \u2018cos i took a gap year last year. so i\u2019ve been sooo excited to actually start learning! (laughs) and to be honest, my course is really fun!\u201d said the dentistry student.    both did not expect to return to singapore so soon. according to them, everything was normal in boston and australia just a week ago, with everyone going about with their daily routines.   shanisse had even taken a trip out to portland over the weekend before she left, and told us that \u201ceverything was still functioning\u201d as per normal, with people going to work and restaurants still open.   but all that changed when us president donald trump declared a national emergency over the coronavirus that weekend.    \u201cwhen we came back from portland, nothing was open for business,\u201d shanisse recounted. \u201cstarbucks and mcdonald\u2019s were closed and suddenly, the whole town became deserted. even uber drivers stopped picking up passengers so it was hard to get around. the supermarket was also empty. it\u2019s worse than the hoarding here. it was quite hard for us to get food, and we survived the last two days in boston on instant noodles. i\u2019m so lucky to be home. if i had gotten the virus there, i think it would be very hard to access healthcare. that was when i realised that i needed to take the next available flight out.    it all happened so quickly that shanisse tells us that some of her friends did not manage to notify the hospital of their departure. even their airbnb host didn\u2019t know that they\u2019ve left. on her flight, shanisse observed that everyone was in full anti-covid-19 gear. \u201ci did wear a mask on the plane, but i felt slightly under prepared \u2018cos so many other passengers were in full protective gowns and in hair caps!\u201d she said.   on the other hand, shalynn was initially troubled over the decision to return to singapore, as she would have to be quarantined for two weeks in australia if she chooses to head back down under.    \u201ci would be missing out on my clinicals and they\u2019re very strict about it, and i don\u2019t want to miss any lessons,\u201d shalynn quipped.    but when university announced that the school might possibly close (it is now) and that lectures would go online, she panicked and immediately called her parents.    \u201cit was madness. i had to change my flight booking six times. at first, i was worried about the curriculum as the school didn\u2019t give us any update. we didn\u2019t know what was happening so we thought we should push back our flight to sunday, which will hopefully give the school some time to make an official announcement.     but my dad was very insistent that i came home as soon as possible and i agree with him, so i rescheduled my flight at around 11.50pm last wednesday night and flew out at around 8am the next morning. i literally had to throw all my clothes and essentials into my luggage!\u201d shalynn revealed.   but unlike shanisse, shalynn fortunately had enough \nfood to go around as she had just gone on a supermarket run a few days before. according to her, the supermarket was \u201cwell stocked\u201d until the last week she was there.    \u201cthe first to go was toilet paper. actually, any type of tissue paper. the next to go was rice, pasta and bread. it was really quite insane. i wanted to make some green curry \u2018cos i was craving it but there wasn\u2019t any more rice available to go with it,\u201d she laughs.   eventually, shalynn decided to cook up a feast for herself and her friends using the rest of the fish and meat she had bought.    \u201ci didn\u2019t avoid my housemates lah, even though two of them are from china and one was from wuhan. they came way before this virus broke out so i guess it\u2019s fine,\u201d shalynn mused.    photos: shalynn tsai/shanisse tsai/chen xiuhuan/instagram ",

and has been allowed to return home,\u201c he said.paediatrician datuk dr zulkifli ismail said although so far there are no cases of deaths involving children due to the 2019-ncov outbreak, they must take the necessary precautions as their immune systems are weaker than that of adults.\"similar to what happened during sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2002), children are less likely to be infected but once they are 'hit', they are expected to face severe complications due to the immunity factor and their smaller lung size,\" he said.dr zulkifli, who works at kpj selangor specialist hospital in shah alam, said besides encouraging children to frequently wash their hands with soap and water, they should also be kept away from sick individuals and not taken to crowded places.he also said that breastfeeding and vaccinations are the best protection for babies while children need a balanced diet to strengthen their immune system.\u00a0\u00a0sound health \nmanagement

agencies\u00a0providing the necessary services to check any outbreak of the coronavirus infection,\" said dr lee, who is experienced in handling sars, nipah and ebola cases.he also urged the public to cooperate by complying with the advice and recommendations made by the authorities. more importantly, he added, they should not believe fake news reports circulated by irresponsible parties as it would only worsen the situation.on the quarantine period for patients who are tested positive for 2019-ncov, dr lee said the recovery period for the patients may differ, depending on the type of infection and the complications they suffered from.he also said that more studies have to be carried out to get accurate data in order to determine whether or not patients who recover from the coronavirus infection will remain free of similar infections in future.\u00a0\"the outbreak in\u00a0china will last months at the very least if they can control it there. the full health impact will only be clear when we get more details, including\u00a0the actual mortality rate, as many mild or asymptomatic cases were not tested in china due to the large numbers (cases all occurring at the same time).\"at the moment, with the current available data, it (2019-ncov) seems to be more infectious but less severe than sars. the picture will be clearer as we obtain more data moving forward,\u201d he added.on reports that the drug nelfinavir can be used to treat coronavirus infection, dr lee said: \"there's no confirmation yet but they are trying some hiv drugs, including lopinavir,\u00a0which

coronavirus is not the same as the seasonal flu, experts stressed on wednesday (march 11). \n mortality \n covid-19, the illness caused by coronavirus, proves deadly in around 3.5 per cent of confirmed cases.\u00a0 \n while this is not the same as its mortality rate, given many people may be infected but not realise it, it is significantly higher than seasonal flu, which typically kills 0.1 per cent of patients.\u00a0 \n \"there is still considerable uncertainty around the fatality rates of covid-19 and it likely varies depending on the quality of local healthcare,\" said mr francois

flu lineages currently in circulation.\" \n serious cases \n but the true danger of coronavirus is unlikely to be the death toll. experts say health systems could easily become overwhelmed by the number of cases requiring hospitalisation \u2014 and, often ventilation to support breathing.\u00a0\u00a0 \n an analysis of 45,000 confirmed cases in china, where the epidemic originated, show that the vast majority of deaths were among the elderly (14.8 per cent mortality among those over their 80s). \n but another chinese study showed that 41 per cent of serious cases occurred among the under-50s, compared with 27 per cent among the over-65s. \n \"it's true that if you're older you're at greater risk, but serious cases can also happen in relatively young people with no prior

than 100 years. \n \"we've studied it closely,\" he said. \"this new virus resembles the flu in terms of physical symptoms but there are huge differences.\" \n number one is the lack of a vaccine against covid-19, or even any treatment shown to be consistently effective.\u00a0 \n while some trials have shown promise delivering anti-retroviral drugs to serious cases, as well as some experimental therapies, their sample sizes are too small to roll out to the general population. \n hundreds of researchers around the world are working frantically to find a covid-19 vaccine, but the development process takes months and is likely too late for the current outbreak. \n even if a vaccine magically appeared, getting everyone access to it is no small order. health authorities regularly complain that not enough people receive the flu vaccine to guarantee \"herd immunity\".\u00a0 \n similarities \n but the new virus does share some characteristics with flu, notably the measures each one of us can personally take to slow the infection rate: avoid shaking hands, frequently wash your hands with soap and water, avoid touching your face and wear a mask if you are sick. \n such actions can limit new infections just as they can with the flu, gastro illnesses and other infectious diseases. \n france's health ministry says that only two in 10 people regularly wash their hands after

far behind. the ongoing suspension of 4g internet since august 5 last year has come as a major obstacle for doctors and people to access crucial guidelines and medical researches on the virus. on march 18, kashmir reported first covid-19 patient. since then, the government took drastic measures comprising lockdown of entire jammu and kashmir to stop spread of the virus. this prompted almost seven million people in the valley to stay indoors as strict restrictions remain imposed on roads. following the advisory, it restricted people from physically visiting doctors or hospitals to avoid contracting the infection. for general ailments, a doctors\u2019 body in kashmir announced free consultation on phone while advising to curtail visits to hospital in order to avoid gatherings. but it has been fraught with challenges. both patients and doctors are unable to explain symptoms and prescribe medicines. a patient, for instance, with obsessive compulsive disorder threw out every article at home with 'made in china\u2019 label. under treatment for last two years for the disorder, the patient\u2019s condition aggravated after finding the virus originated in china prompting guardians to call a doctor. similarly, another patient along with a child locked itself in a room to avoid contracting the infection and even avoided food. \"both the patients required video counselling sessions in the face of advisory and social distancing. i tried to give them tips on phone but it may not work and they may require to physically enroll for counselling session,\" says clinical psychiatrist dr

bombs and bullets at shri maharaja hari singh (smhs) hospital tending to critical patients during armed militancy in 90s, situation had not been as worrying as it is now. the low speed internet frustrated him so much so that he took to twitter to vent. this after he failed to download a mere 24 mb file containing guidelines for intensive care management in hospitals amid the covid-19 outbreak. later, a netizen helped him and sent him screenshots. \"we are facing a pandemic and it requires information as to how can we fight it. our counterparts in affected countries saw

from working freely.\" delay in infromation could prove \ndeadly a doctor based in united kingdom where infections have soars with over 50 deaths concurs with dr saleem. dr sajad ahangar, specialist

internet speed really badly because they are the ones who know where to get the right information for themselves and for the masses,\" he adds. fake information spells more trouble as the pandemic is getting viral, so are unfounded and inaccurate information entering social spaces. the most viable help to fight this misinformation is peddling accurate information by experts on popular social media platforms. many people instead of supporting social distancing organised community langars to seek protection from the virus in the valley. in one such instance, j&k police filed a case against them in shopian\u2019s dachoo village on march 22. this, dr masood rashid, consultant anesthetist critical care at j&k health department says could have been avoided by reaching out to them through videos in local languages to raise awareness but the speed restriction has hammered it. \"we could have translated who guidelines in local language to reach out. it could have helped us to reach out to vast network of rural and remote areas,\" he adds. doctors fight a lonely battle in srinagar\u2019s smhs hospital, the region tertiary care hospital, doctors are fighting a lonely battle against the virus in absence of protective gear, equipment putting them at high risk. this was quite evident when two women doctors at smhs hospital and sher-e-kashmir institute of medical sciences developed respiratory problems, fever and cold. since then, many doctors said their families are worried about their safety and have been frequently calling them during working hours. the resident doctors\u2019 association in a communique to principal government medical college and associated hospitals on march 20 highlighted lack of face masks and protective gear in hospitals. they argued against going home to avoid spreading virus to their families and instead sought hostel accommodation. while the latter demand has not been conceded yet but principal of government medical college and associated hospitals srinagar, samia rashid, announced arrival of 1 lakh masks for hospitals. chours for 4g grows this desperation amid the pandemic also prompted amnesty international india to push for restoring internet for health and safety-related information. \"there is a growing anxiety around the pandemic and unwarranted restrictions on content and dissemination of information only stands to add to the panic,\" said avinash kumar, executive director of amnesty international india. national conference member of parliament dr farooq abdullah too wrote to prime minister narendra modi on march 18 seeking restoration of high-speed mobile internet. similarly in a letter, srinagar municipal corporation \nmayor junaid azim mattu urged the home minister amit shah to restore the internet \"people are being advised to work/study from home but this is impossible with 2g internet speed and limited fixed line internet penetration,\" abdullah said and added, \"i would, therefore, request you to restore 4g internet services in jammu and kashmir at the earliest to ease the suffering of the people.\" but there has been no let-up in the speed restrictions as the curbs have been extended.

price war. petrol prices slipped below rs 71-mark for the first time in eight months on monday as india looks set to reap windfall from a price war among oil producers leading to international crude prices crashing by their biggest margin since the 1991 gulf war. international oil prices crashed by close to 31 per cent, the second-largest margin on record, after the disintegration of the opec+ alliance triggered an all-out price war between saudi arabia and russia. brent futures plummeted to about usd 31 a barrel on monday as goldman sachs warned prices could drop to near usd 20. for india, which imports over 84 per cent of its oil needs, the slump would lead to lower import bill and a cut in retail prices but will harm already stressed upstream firms such as ongc. lower oil prices will also help economy from its 11-year low growth rate by way of reducing input cost for a lot of sectors. in delhi, petrol prices dropped to rs 70.59 a litre, the lowest since early july 2019, and diesel rate were cut to rs 63.26, according to a price notification of state-owned firms. fuel prices have been on the decline since februray 27 on international trends. petrol prices have in all fallen by rs 1.42 a litre since then and diesel rates have dropped by rs 1.44 per litre. but the only dampener in the entire scheme of things is rupee which settled 23 paise down at 74.10 against the us dollar. a weaker rupee means india pays more for buying the same amount of commodity from overseas. it will also help lower inflation rate. according to the oil ministry's petroleum planning and analysis cell, india is likely to pay usd 105.58 billion or rs 7.43 lakh crore on import of 225 million tonnes of crude oil in the fiscal year 2019-20, which ends this month. this compares to usd 111.9 billion (rs 7.83 lakh crore) paid for import of 226.5 million tonnes of oil in 2018-19. the 2019-20 projection is based on average price of usd 66 per barrel for the basket of crude oil india imports and average exchange rate of 71 to a us dollar. oil company officials said the import bill will fall in the next fiscal beginning april but an estimation cannot be made given the extreme volatility in the oil and currency market. it certainly will translate into lower retail prices of petrol and diesel in the coming days as the current rates do not reflect the slump in international prices, they said. retail prices of the day are based on average price of benchmark international fuel of the preceeding fortnight. and the drop in prices to usd 31 will get reflected in retail prices over the next 7-10 days. the moving average helps narrow the extreme volatility in the prices, they said. on the negative side, lower oil prices mean they become more competitive versus renewable energy and delay switchover to cleaner fuels in fight against climate change. industry association assocham said the fall in crude prices will help india recover as \nlow prices of crude can be a demand driver while also taming the inflation. however, morgan stanley believes that the drop in oil prices may not be good news for the economy as the gains will remain capped due to the overall weakness in the economy given the coronavirus-related health scare. the decline in oil prices, it said, will negatively impact the capex outlook for oil related sectors as well as oil producing countries. the fall in oil prices comes at a time when the global economy is already reeling under the impact of coronavirus, which has dented demand across sectors and economies. rating agency icra said the plunge in crude oil prices is credit negative for indian upstream companies as their realisations and cash accruals will decline. if the crude prices were to remain in the band of $30-40 per barrel, most of the indian upstream companies could report losses, as the cost structure would remain rigid in the short-run. additionally, gas prices at various international gas hubs have declined, which would lead to lower domestic gas prices in the next fiscal. accordingly, the realisations on gas sales would also decrease even as gas production remains either a break-even or a loss-making proposition for most fields for the upstream producers, notwithstanding some decline in oilfield services/equipment cost, icra said. international energy agency (iea) on monday cut global oil demand forecast for 2020 by 1.1 million barrels per day as coronavirus spread beyond china. for the first time since 2009, demand is expected to fall year-on-year, by 90,000 barrels per day to 99.9 million barrels per day in 2020.

On Monday evening, the cancellation of the International Crafts Fair (to him) in Munich was known, which should have taken place with around 1000 exhibitors in mid-March. \"At certain points in Germany, everyday life will have to be limited,\" said the minister. This concerns, for example, individual school closures. For companies there must be a graded risk assessment, Spahn said. Until Monday afternoon, the Robert Koch-Institut (RKI) was covered nationwide 157 SARS COV-2 infections, more than half of them alone in North Rhine-Westphalia. The Institute stated the risk assessment for the health of the population in Germany from \"low to moderate\" to \"moderate to high\". For the EU, EU health agency ECDC studied the risk of \"moderately up to high\", as EU Commission Chefs, Ursula communicated from the Leyen. In several countries worldwide, the figures rise rapidly, around 90,000 infections with the Coronavirus SARS COV-2 and more than 3,000 deaths are now recorded. Within about one day, individual proofs were reported in several previously unaffected million metropolises, including Berlin, Moscow, Delhi and New York. In Germany, in 11, the 16 federal states are now registered. Only in Saarland and a few East German federal states was not reported. On Monday evening, the first confirmed case came to Saxony. The affected pensioner belongs to a group of bus travelers, which returned from Italy. The worry against infections in the Great Brandenburg Erlebnisbad Tropical Islands did not confirm in the previously evaluated tests. The situation is very dynamic and had to be reassessed every day, said RKI President Lothar Wieler. The country of origin of China, the Coronavirus epidemic, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) assessment, always gets better. On Sunday, only 206 new infections were reported, said WHO boss Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Monday in Geneva. That's the lowest number since January 22nd. The most concern is currently the location in South Korea, Italy, Japan and Iran, where there are partly a significant plus in case numbers. On Monday, a WHO team in Iran arrived to help control the disease supplemented the WHO boss. Germany, France and Great Britain, according to Parisian information, want to invest financially with almost five million euros. Italy is the most affected by the Covid 19 epidemic in Europe \ncountry. There are around 1700 infections, including more than 30 deaths. In Italy, the schedule changes of the series A provide displeasure. So the football clubs in the north have to play further without viewers, including from the top league Italy's record champion Juventus Turin and Inter Milan. In total, according to the EU Commission, it has now been significantly more than 2000 SARS COV 2 infections in 18 EU countries. However, closing boundaries or restricting travel freedom would not be adequate or proportionate step, said Health Minister Spahn. He also turned against a recruitment of direct flights between China and Germany. However, airlines such as Lufthansa and Ryanair stroked flights - even because of lack of demand. In the spread of the new coronavirus, experts in the coming weeks is mainly a delay of the epidemic. The better things to keep the rate of infections, the lower the pressure on the medical system and society will be said the virologist Christian's premier. It makes a huge difference, whether a spreading wave a population within a few weeks or two years distributed to large parts. According to his calculations, the Covid-19 death rate is 0.3 to 0.7 percent, said droos. This means that from 1000 infected 3 to 7 die. Probably the actual rate even below, the renowned virologist explained by the Berlin Charit\u00e9. The hardest estimating is currently at what speed the virus spreads. There are indications that an infected one is infected three more people - but this value is subject to great uncertainties. An epidemic is stopped when an infected statistically infected on average less than another person. First, however, in Germany, it is also further from a significant increase in the case numbers and newly discovered infection chains. For example, infection was detected in Berlin - and only random: the infection in a 22-year-old was noticed because the Charit\u00e9 influenza and coronavirus test combines. The man had been brought to the emergency room on Sunday with neurological symptoms. He is now treated in isolation in the Virchow Clinic of the Charit\u00e9. As the Berliner infected with SARS COV-2, was initially unclear. \"There is a quiet trail to North Rhine-Westphalia,\" said Charit\u00e9 Executive Board Ulrich free. The man's parents live there and visited him. North Rhine-Westphalia is currently with more than 90 detection of the most severely affected state. For a heavy 47-year-old, which has been treated for days in the D\u00fcsseldorf university clinic, there is still no all-clear, it also said. The man and his a year's younger woman had celebrated on 15 February in gangled at a meeting of carnival. numerous \nPeople should have infected on the celebration. The Virus SARS COV-2 can cause the disease COVID-19. Most infected people have only a slight cold symptom with shiver and sore throat, which disappears within a few days, or no symptoms. About 15 out of 100 infected falls according to the previous calculations RKI. They get about breathing problems or pneumonia. Above all, older people or those with pre-conditions are concerned. Visually, deaths occur. The incubation time - the period between infection and start of symptoms - is usually 2 to 14 days after the current level. This is the reason that suspected cases are usually isolated about two weeks. The goal is to contain the infection to not overwhelming the health system. The reason is not that it is about a particularly dangerous disease. However, the economic consequences of the epidemic are becoming more and more noticeable. The industrialized organization OECD expects only a global economy of 2.4 percent in the current year. That's half a percentage point less than last predicted. In the previous year, the economy had increased by 2.9 percent worldwide.

", "label": 1}, {"content": "How creates a plague? Whether you are allowed to be alive at all is a matter of view. Viruses have no metabolism, they do not breathe, they do not burn calories. They consist only of a hereditary molecule, packed in proteins, sometimes wraps by a greasy membrane. A kind of life wake up viruses after they have penetrated into a body cell. Then the few viral genes take the command over the host and force him to multiply the pathogen millions of times. Not all viruses make sick. Not all are dangerous for people. If the immune system is trained for your defense, it can stop infection quickly. Or it keeps the pathogen at least under control - such as a herpes infection. But if the body defense gets to do it with new or mutated viruses, they are not stored in immune moment - then it can be dangerous. Especially dangerous are RNA viruses. You can change quickly and overlook the immune system again and again. Her rapid change allows some of them to suddenly infect people instead of an animal species. The Coronaviruses, the 2002 and 2003 the SARS outbreaks, 2013 the Mers epidemic and now, since the end of 2019, the new disease wave in Wuhan triggered were originally dominated in bats. From there, the Ebolavirus also comes, whose most dangerous variant can kill up to 80 percent of the infected. The annual recurring influenza pathogens mutate in poultry and pigs to jump to people. HIV, the well-integing virus of man, was originally a monkey virus. At the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities of the World Health Organization WHO reported an accumulation of pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause in the Central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the diseases. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days then a group released a group of the virologen Christian's premier from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 the first diagnostic test for the new virus, the researcher provisionally call 2019-NCOV. With the test, the virus can be detected in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, on which, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected. Both the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as well as Mers (MIDDLE East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses which have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more than 750 died. With the MERS virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronaviruses. many of them \nresponse the respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example. In China, several thousand persons are suffering from them, some of them - most of them with pre-existing conditions - have died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first infection cases outside of China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been in Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection with a tourist, who came back from Wuhan, on January 24, the first cases were known in France. Meanwhile, first cases were confirmed in Germany. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. The virus can cause pneumonia that can endally end. Since it is a viral illness, antibiotics do not help. Meanwhile, it is clear that the virus can be transferred from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transfers after a dozen cases were known in medical staff. Medizors assume that the virus is transmitted above all over droplet infection. The World Health Organization calculates, as announced on January 24, at the moment that an infected one cuts 1.4 to 2.5 other people. Contest these numbers, the virus is less contagious than SARS and also the viral flu. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals. That can not be said yet. The World Health Organization said on 28 January that about one-fifth of the reported cases through the virus will be seriously ill, so in case of doubt must be treated intensive care. According to reports, the first death pots were patients who had some severe pre-existing conditions. Even with other infectious diseases, people with pre-existing diseases are particularly endangered - for example at the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so change their genome. This can cause you to become more dangerous for people in the course of an outbreak - but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) expects no similar mortality to the current time as the outbreak of SARS. They all use, unlike many other viruses and all higher creatures, not the hereditary molecule DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) as a memory for their genetic information, but its chemical relatives, the ribonucleic acid RNA - and that has consequences. RNA viruses mutate very quickly, because the hereditary molecule itself is chemically less stable than the pendant DNA. Above all, the enzymes that are responsible for the duplication of genetic information make many copy errors. The RNA polymerases lack one \nControl function, which have DNA-copying enzymes. These check the freshly formed copy of the hereditary molecules for errors and set for correction. Since it runs without this mechanism, RNA duplication is much inaccurate. The result: Each newly emerging virus is a mutant. Most mutations harm the pathogen itself, but sometimes they also lead to new adjustments. How dangerous a virus epidemic is ultimately depends on many circumstances. How fast and how many of the infected kills the pathogen? How easy is he transferred? Which way does he use for the transfer? A virus does not die with his victim only if it has previously infected enough more people. If the infection only transfers from the original host - ie an animal - to humans, the spread of the disease will remain limited. However, the pathogen manages the spread of person to person, it can come to worldwide pandemics. This danger is particularly large if the transmission is carried out by droplet infection by the air. That's the case with the influenza. The new coronavirus 2019-NCOV also jumps through the air to his next victim. Decisive for the course of an epidemic, however, is also at which stage of the disease can infect the infected other people. In the SARS epidemic 2002 and 2003, the viruses were transferred only when the infected clear disease symptoms had and could be detected well. This seems to be the case with 2019-NCOV. A number of pathogens behave in this regard but very different. You can already infect the next victim if the wearer has no complaints. On this strategy, viruses are instructed, which are not particularly spreading - for example because they are transmitted only by blood-blood contact. The Ebolavirus is an example of this infection dynamics. It is not transmitted through the air and would hardly spread if the disease would be contagious only after the outbreak of hemorrhagic fever. The most extreme example of this type of distribution is HIV. This pathogen is also transferred only to a person when he gets device in its bloodstream. In addition, HIV is little efficient - not every contact establishes a new infection. This disadvantage equates to the AIDS pathogen by an extremely long incubation time. He can hid many years hidden in the immune cells of an infected, until he triggers immune weakness. But before that he uses the long time to infuse unrecognized many other sexual partners of his victim. Despite its low infectivity, the HI virus has triggered one of the worst epidemics of human history in this way. Viruses are harder to combat drugs than about bacterial pathogens. Because they have only a few genes in their genome, they offer only a very limited number of attack points for \nPharmacological substances. Virostika is usually directed against the DNA or RNA polymerases that multiply the genetic material of the viruses. Other drugs block the formation of protective viral envelope. The few genes with which viruses can secure their existence, make them a great puzzle for biologists. Can this really be life? It is possible that viruses were created very early in the history of life - as a kind of parasitic erbsubstance, which seems to the first cells on the earth. Another hypothesis is: viruses were originally alive. These were cells that harassed their metabolism and transferred to a way of life as genetic parasites. We are far from know all about these seemingly simple forms. But one thing is certain: a race, how researchers and doctors experience him now, will give it again and again. In the future, viruses of animal hosts will be skipped on humans in the future. Always the same fundamental questions are asked: Is the pathogen new? Is he dangerous? Where is his vulnerability? And: Are we fast enough?

In 2012, the Mers virus (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) appeared in the Fort. It is less contagious, but more aggressive: from around 2500 infected until November 2019, almost 860 died - about every third. 2019-NCOV is very closely related to SARS. - Infectosity: As contagious the new virus is, so far difficult to judge. Chinese authorities assume that an an average of 1.4 to 2.5 people infected - that would be similar to SARS. \"Such numbers are extremely unreliable,\" says the virologist Christian's premier from the Berlin Charit\u00e9. Accordingly, the transfer rate depends on many factors - for example, whether people are socially active or rather stay at home. Excludes that, according to the view, the measures in China are aimed at. \"I think these measures bring something.\" Positive is that people usually become infectious only with the symptoms - in contrast to the flu, in which people are already contagious before they ill. - Aggressiveness: The new coronavirus seems to be less aggressive than SARS and MERS. By Monday, 80 from around 2800 infected - the depot of a mortality rate of 2.9 percent. However, the number should be fooled, because especially at the beginning of an outbreak, the heavy cases are more known. A mortality of three percent would be a lot after viewing. The expert assumes that even the ten percent usually stated for SARS are a much too high. \"Probably there was much more than the well-known 8000 SARS cases,\" he explains. - Symptoms: Incubation Time - the period between infection and start of symptoms - is 2 to 14 days. The pulmonary disease manifests itself by fever, dry cough, shock and shortness of breath. Because the virus infects the lower respiratory tract, affected do not have a cold. Ultimately, the symptoms are similar to those of a SARS infection. No wonder, because the new virus docks on the same receptor. The test on the virus is usually based on the analysis of sputum (ejection) and takes about two hours. - Therapy: There is no special therapy for pulmonary disease. Heavy-diseased patients are treated symptomatically: with \nFever-cut agents, the therapy of any bacterial additional infections and sometimes mechanical ventilation. - Vaccination: A vaccine would be the best way to curb the epidemic. According to Jonas Schmidt-Chanasite from the Bernhard-Steint-Institut for Tropical Medicine, vaccine candidates are currently being tested against Mers in humans. They are - successful results assumed - at the earliest in a few months available. \"Then let yourself build up,\" says Schmidt-Chanasite. - Reservoire: The reservoirs of various coronaviras are in the animal kingdom. At MERS, camels of origin, with SARS and the new pathogen, are the reservoirs probably with bat mice. On humans, the SARS pathogens probably jumped from Schleichzatzen, which are offered in Chinese markets. Also 2019-NCOV probably expects an animal market in China. From which species the virus exceeded, is currently unknown. - Protection: For protection against this as well as other viruses, experts recommend ordinary hygiene measures: regular hand washing, disinfectants and distance to suffice. The benefits of normal breathing masks - as currently in China to see everywhere on the streets - treasures Schmidt-Chanasite and exceeds as rather low. Forecasts: Some experts expect a long outbreak. \"We should consider that as a marathon and not as a sprint,\" said Chris Whitty, who advises the British government in health issues. \"The extent and effects of this outbreak are currently unclear because the situation is developing rapidly,\" wrote a team around Anthony Fauci from the US national health institutions (NiH) in the journal \"Jama\". By contrast, the virologist's artery can imagine that the epidemic ends similarly quickly as the SARS outbreak that has been completed quickly and completed in 2004 for completion. \"I'm inclined to think optimistic because that is a SARS-like disease.\" Take care of that outside of China so far hardly came to a redistribution. \"That's extremely encouraging.\" SARS continues to circle - but only in the animal kingdom.

new york state suffered another quick and brutal rise in the number of covid-19 cases on tuesday, staggering hospitals at the u.s. epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic, as california said it could be facing the next major wave of the disease. in new york city, the densely packed home of more than 8 million people, healthcare officials tried to find hospital beds for the surging number of coronavirus patients as the statewide death toll rose to 210, with more than 25,600 confirmed cases. the white house advised anyone who has visited or left new york to isolate themselves.

hospital beds in new york state at the peak of the outbreak has spiraled to 140,000, nearly three times what are available. infections were now doubling every three days in new york and the worst could still be two to three weeks away, said new york governor andrew cuomo. nationwide, covid-19, which broke out late last year in wuhan, china, has infected more than 53,000 people and killed at

coronavirus, and possible markers of infection.   on friday (march 20), british ear, nose and throat (ent) doctors, citing reports from colleagues around the world, called on adults who lose their senses of smell to isolate themselves for seven days, even if they have no other symptoms, to slow the disease\u2019s spread. the published data is limited, but doctors are concerned enough to raise

of the british rhinological society, wrote in an email. \u201cit could contribute to slowing transmission and save lives.\u201d   she and professor nirmal kumar, president of ent uk, a group representing ear, nose and throat doctors in britain, issued a joint statement urging health care workers to use personal protective equipment when treating any patients who have lost their senses of smell, and advised against performing nonessential sinus endoscopy procedures on anyone, because the virus replicates in the nose and the throat and an exam can prompt coughs or sneezes that expose the doctor to a high level of virus.   two ear, nose and throat specialists in britain who have been infected with the coronavirus are in critical condition, dr hopkins said. earlier reports from wuhan, china, where the coronavirus first emerged, had warned that ear, nose and throat specialists as well as eye doctors were infected and dying in large numbers, hopkins said.   the british physicians cited reports from other countries indicating that significant numbers of coronavirus patients experienced anosmia, saying that in south korea, where testing has been widespread, 30 per cent of 2,000 patients who tested positive experienced anosmia as their major presenting symptom (these were mild cases).   the american academy of otolaryngology on sunday posted information on its website saying that mounting anecdotal evidence indicates that lost or reduced sense of smell and loss of taste are significant symptoms associated with covid-19, and that they have been seen in patients who ultimately tested positive with no other symptoms.   dr rachel kaye, an assistant professor of otolaryngology at rutgers, said colleagues in new rochelle, new york, which has been the center of an outbreak, first alerted her to the smell loss associated with the coronavirus, sharing that patients who had \nfirst complained of anosmia later tested positive for the coronavirus.

scale down,\u201d she said, adding that her department at rutgers had already started using personal protective equipment and stopped performing nonessential exams.   in the areas of italy most heavily affected by the virus, doctors say they have concluded that loss of taste and smell is an indication that a person who otherwise seems healthy is in fact carrying the virus and may be spreading it to others.   \u201calmost everybody who is hospitalised has this same story,\u201d said dr marco metra, chief of the cardiology department at the main hospital in brescia, where 700 of

district to interview coronavirus patients, has said in interviews that at least two-thirds of the more than 100 he talked to with mild disease reported experiencing loss of smell and taste lasting several days.   another physician who studied a cluster of coronavirus patients in germany said in an email that roughly half of the patients had experienced a smell or taste disorder, and that the sensory loss usually presented after the first symptoms of respiratory illness, but could be used to distinguish people who should be tested.   dr clemens wendtner, a professor of medicine at the academic teaching hospital of ludwig-maximilians university of munich, said that the patients regained their ability to smell after a few days or weeks, and that the loss occurred regardless of how sick they got or whether they were congested. using nasal drops or sprays did not help, wendtner said.   several american patients who have had symptoms consistent with the coronavirus, but who have not been tested or are still awaiting test results, described losing their senses of smell and taste, even though their noses were clear and they were not congested.   mr andrew berry, 30, developed a fever and body aches about 10 days ago, and then a sore throat and debilitating headaches. he tested negative for influenza and has not gotten the result of a coronavirus test taken four days ago, but his physician was convinced that he had the virus, he said.   now, mr berry said, he literally cannot smell the coffee.   \u201ceven with a clear nose, i just realised i couldn\u2019t smell the food

(\u201cthe impact of 2019-ncov on industrial metals\u201d, feb. 14, 2020) quarantining and restrictions on movement at a time when migrant workers would normally be expected to be returning to work mean the number of \u201cmissing work days\u201d in china is roughly \u201cequivalent to the entire u.s. workforce taking an unplanned break for two months.\u201d goldman has just cut its three, six and 12-month copper price forecasts from $6,300, $6,500 and $7,000 per tonne to $5,900, $6,200 and $6,500 respectively. the investment bank argues that the virus represents \u201ca meaningful demand shock for copper\u201d and is modelling a demand decline of 18% year on year in the first quarter. the promise of future stimulus risks blinding investors to \u201cthe physical realities of the disruption today,\u201d (\u201cpromise of stimulus builds \ndownside risk to commodities\u201d, feb. 21, 2020). analysts at citi agree. \u201cour base case is for physical market weakness to dominate futures buying over the coming weeks,\u201d it said. (\u201cmetals weekly,\u201d feb. 18, 2020). \u201cthe chinese demand recovery is likely to be more gradual than many expect, since more than three-quarters of migrant workers are yet to return post (chinese new year), and half of these are not expected to return until march,\u201d the bank adds. a big short-term hit to copper demand will translate into surging inventories, which will in turn require hedge short positions to be built on the cme and london metal exchange (lme). citi estimates that 500,000 to 700,000 tonnes of industrial short positions could be seen, pressuring prices further. it\u2019s possible a massive counter-build in speculative positioning could compensate but it would require a sharp shift in the coronavirus news-flow such as a clinical drug breakthrough. signs of surplus metal are already starting to show in china. stocks of copper registered with the shanghai futures exchange (shfe) have ballooned from 124,000 tonnes at the start of january to 298,600 tonnes. chinese copper inventory always rises over the new year holiday period but this year\u2019s 175,000-tonne surge is already outpacing the peak january-march build of 143,000 tonnes in 2019 and 156,000 tonnes in 2018. inventories at bonded warehouses in shanghai are also thought to be rising. the pronounced contango across the front part of the shfe copper futures curve suggests the local market is expecting more surplus metal to appear in the coming weeks. mitigating some of the demand shock may be lower chinese copper production as smelters face their own physical supply-chain headaches. smelters are struggling both to receive enough mined concentrate to keep running and to sell the sulphuric acid they generate as a by-product of making copper. \u201cthere is a general loss of efficiency across the concentrates supply chain from ports to smelters due to restrictions on movement and extension of holidays for couriers, customs brokers, customs, etc.,\u201d according to research house wood mackenzie. it notes that multiple chinese smelters are experiencing concentrates delivery delays. (\u201ccoronavirus and its impact on the copper market,\u201d feb. 6, 2020). the acid market in china, meanwhile, has partially ground to a halt. woodmac estimates that hubei province, the epicentre of the virus outbreak, is the largest phosphate fertilizer producer in china and accounts for around 20% of the country\u2019s sulphuric acid consumption. copper smelters have only limited acid storage capacity, threatening their ability to maintain production. one producer, guangxi nanguo copper with production capacity of 300,000 tonnes per year, has already declared partial force majeure on concentrate deliveries as it adjusts run-rates. others are expected to follow by bringing forward planned maintenance downtime. lower domestic copper production and the likely push- \nback of smelter expansion projects offer only a partial offset to the demand shock unfolding in china. they do, however, inject yet more uncertainty and potential price volatility into an already complex equation. so too does the apparent spread of the virus to south korea and northern italy, each of which poses another set of physical supply-chain problems. the current \u201chigh degree of uncertainty about the size and duration of the disruptions (will) mean industrial metals are likely to face significant headwinds and rising volatility in coming months,\u201d according to goldman sachs. fund managers appear to agree.

data is nearly assuredly on the way. on thursday, economists expect a report to show the number of americans applying for jobless claims easily set a record last week. some say the number could be way beyond 1 million, amid a wave of layoffs, topping the prior record of 695,000 set in 1982. helping to lift sentiment in markets was news from china that it is preparing to lift the lockdown in wuhan,

africa. \"over the last three years, we have invested resources in improving infectious disease surveillance and response capacity. our national reference laboratory has the capacity for molecular diagnosis of pathogens and we are receiving guidance from who on the primers and reagents that will be used to test suspected coronavirus cases.\" read | coronavirus: don't panic, say sa experts elsewhere, ugandan physician sabrina kitaka also cited the ebola response as an example of how the country has successfully managed previous infectious and said authorities were taking all precautions at border entries to deal with the new coronavirus, officially known as \"2019-ncov\". \"this is a new virus with very scanty information on the virulence and transmission dynamics,\" said kyeng mercy tetuh, a cameroonian public health expert and epidemiologis. in the case of cameroon, tetuh said that while health authorities have stressed the country's preparedness, this may not be the case in areas affected by insecurity such as the anglophone regions. \"a challenge in containing ebola in the drc has been insecurity,\" she said, referring to an ongoing outbreak of the deadly disease that has seen medical teams came under attack from armed militias in eastern drc. for its part, mauritius announced that all passengers coming from wuhan are being quarantined, while others from china would be monitored by healthcare workers. mozambique said it was suspending visas for visitors from china and blocking travel to the country, while in neighbouring south africa minister of health zweli mkhize said temperature screenings using non-invasive thermometers would be conducted at 12 point of entries and health officials would go aboard international aircraft to determine any sick travellers. ivory coast, where the continent's first suspected case was reported, has also installed thermal imaging cameras at airports. major challenges yet, tanzanian clinician joachim mabula said airport screenings may not be sufficient. \"the screening process involves looking for symptoms; people can have a disease yet not show symptoms,\" he said. he added that many african countries do not have the required laboratory capacity to respond to an infectious disease like the new coronavirus, an issue also highlighted by erondu. \"unfortunately, many disease surveillance systems throughout african countries are weak and most of the continent lack diagnostic capability, for example laboratory capacity, so identifying \ncases and controlling the outbreak could be difficult, especially in resource-constrained countries,\" erondu said. in mabula's opinion, african countries should cancel flights to and from china - so far, african carriers that have taken such a step include rwandaair, kenya airways, royal air maroc, egyptair, air madagascar and air mauritius, while air tanzania has postponed its maiden flight to china. an official at the drc's ministry of health, who chose to remain anonymous, supported such a move: \"in the drc, ebola and measles have claimed thousands of lives; an outbreak of coronavirus is the last thing we need, thus cancelling flights is sensible.\" the official added that \"screening and healthcare systems vary in strength from country to country, therefore if the virus reaches one african country from china, it may be difficult to stop it spreading to others.\" in the official's opinion, another concern is the spreading of fake news: \"this leads to mass panic. african governments need to be transparent with all information.\" suzana da lomba, a teacher based in angola's capital, luanda, said fake news was already having an impact. \"the hysteria and lack of information globally means friends are warning each other to not go to chinese-owned shops and restaurants.\" ", "label": 0}, {"content": "temperature screening still useful in detecting covid-19 cases despite limitations, experts say. singapore \u2014 the recent spate of covid-19 infections have raised questions about the effectiveness of temperature screening, but several infectious diseases experts said that it remains a useful precautionary measure, provided it is not carried out in isolation.   such screening is still able to detect a \u201csignificant\u201d number of covid-19 cases, they told today, because a sizable proportion of patients develop fever, even though not all do.   concern about the usefulness of temperature screening grew after the discovery of a new cluster of infections linked to a dinner at a chinese restaurant in safra jurong. all the attendees had cleared mandatory temperature checks and travel declarations, the club said.   another case of a singaporean man who had visited a gym in safra punggol had also passed temperature screening but he was later found to have contracted the coronavirus.   the safra jurong cluster is so far the largest in singapore, with 39 confirmed cases on tuesday (march 10).   why is it still useful?   some of the experts said that the incidents show the limitations of temperature screening checks at public spaces to detect covid-19, given its incubation period of around two weeks.   they included professor tikki pangestu, a visiting professor at the lee kuan yew school of public policy and former director of the research policy and cooperation department at the world health organization.   he said the screening had shown that it is not particularly efficient at picking up or detecting cases, and infected persons may not have developed symptoms of illnesses but may still be shedding the virus.   generally, the consensus is that having such a practice across singapore is still better than nothing, because it would help detect febrile \u2014 or feverish \u2014 visitors.   professor ooi eng eong, deputy director of the emerging infectious diseases programme at duke-nus medical school, explained that while temperature checks are not foolproof, they are the \u201cmost objective test\u201d that most public spaces can administer and so, should not be discounted.   \u201cthere is no one single thing that we can do that will 100 per cent, accurately identify all the covid-19 cases. fever screening is probably the most objective test because it\u2019s something that we can measure.\u201d   it is not possible to measure whether someone has a cough or a sore throat due to the coronavirus, prof ooi said.   speaking to the media last week, associate professor kenneth mak, director of medical services at the ministry of health (moh), said that there are still a significant number of covid-19 patients who came down with fever, so temperature screening is still important to help make sense of the situation.   what is the weak link?   assoc prof mak said that the health authorities have recognised that detecting infections through temperature-taking is not fully accurate.   and because such \nmechanisms that try to make sense of the covid-19 outbreak at community events are always going to be limited at picking up cases, it still remains important that individuals avoid any social activity if they are not well.   \u201cthe \u2018sensemaking\u2019 has to start with the individual,\u201d he said.   health minister gan kim yong emphasised that temperature screening form part of singapore\u2019s collective measures to tackle covid-19, stressing the need to look at the various initiatives as \u201ca whole package\u201d.   the travel and health declarations recorded at these screening stations, for example, are valuable in helping the authorities track the movement of people and to account for non-fever symptoms such as cough, runny nose or breathlessness.   however, the experts said that these work only if people are socially responsible and are truthful in their declarations.   prof ooi said that emphasis has to be placed on this responsibility: \u201cif everyone can have that sense of responsibility to say that they are not feeling well and will stay away from everyone else, we\u2019ll be very effective in controlling the disease. you may not need fever screening at that time because people will just own up if they are not well and voluntarily stay away from crowded places.\u201d   on tuesday, health minister gan said that the safra jurong cluster arose as a result of social irresponsibility: one person who felt unwell had attended the private dinner and was later diagnosed with covid-19. the person is believed to have infected 18 others.   is there a need to change strategy?   associate professor hsu li yang, infectious diseases programme leader at the national university of singapore's saw swee hock school of public health, said that the recent increase in infections due largely to the safra jurong cluster does not indicate that singapore\u2019s strategy has failed in its entirety.   \u201chowever, as the case counts rise in several countries and the prospects of global containment dims, it will be timely to reconsider this strategy for one that is more sustainable while minimising the impact on the healthcare system and economy,\u201d dr hsu said.   several other experts agreed, noting that with the coronavirus spreading rapidly worldwide, there may be a need to adjust the strategy so that people may be able live with the reality of the disease \u2014 without trivialising the potential harm to societal health.   dr leong hoe nam, an infectious disease specialist at mount elizabeth novena hospital, said that singapore is tackling covid-19 as if it is a conventional enemy, taking an aggressive stance to try and contain the disease, such as by limiting travel through border controls.   now, with surges in cases such as the safra jurong cluster popping up now and then, the government might need to treat covid-19 like an enemy waging \u201cguerrilla warfare\u201d, he said.\u00a0   \u201cany spike is a concern. it could show an unrecognised transmission cluster and in a very short time, it can overwhelm the system. the virus \nattacks us like guerrillas, breaking through and causing infections.\u201d   a reworked strategy means allowing normal life to resume, with individuals knowing their responsibility in fighting this outbreak, and healthcare institutions as well as singapore\u2019s border controls still maintaining a high bar of vigilance, dr leong added.   do case definitions need to change?   right now, the health authorities mostly conduct tests on suspect cases.   these people fit the case definitions of persons with pneumonia or severe respiratory infection with breathlessness, and they would have recently travelled to mainland china, iran, northern italy, japan and south korea.   tests are also administered on close contacts and those hospitalised with pneumonia.   however, the experts said that for cases that do not meet this definition, there has been some success where tests came back positive as well.   since last week, the government had rolled out covid-19 swab tests at border checkpoints to examine inbound travellers who exhibit fever and other symptoms of respiratory illness but do not meet the clinical definition of a suspect case.   at least one case, an indonesian man who arrived at seletar airport on march 7, was detected to have covid-19 through this new swab test.   the experts are mostly against adjusting the case definitions, because, as prof pang said, doing so would cause confusion and complicate the statistical tracking of cases.   there are some merits to expanding the use of tests instead: doing so will expand singapore\u2019s detection capability, they added.   professor gregory gray, a infectious disease epidemiologist from duke-nus medical school, said that making testing more readily available is \u201cwise\u201d, noting that such self-testing measures, such as those that the bill and melinda gates foundation is providing in america, is a good strategy for gaining better cooperation from people.   in south korea, for example, residents can get tested for free at drive-through stations.\u00a0   dr leong of mount elizabeth novena hospital said that testing and screening should be provided at general practitioner clinics and the more than 900 public health preparedness clinics scattered across the island.   is singapore able to handle more tests?   addressing the question of aggressive covid-19 testing, assoc prof mak of moh said on tuesday that singapore has already adopted such a stance.   across all the labs here, more than 21,000 tests have been done since the start of the outbreak in january, which works out to around 600 to 700 tests each week.   \u201cwe are prepared to scale them up \u2014 we have the capacity to do as much as 2,000 tests in a day,\u201d assoc prof mak said. each test costs around s$260, he had said before.   \u201cwe are looking also at new technologies to see whether it could allow us to improve our diagnostic capabilities and we look forward to commercially available point-of-care testing. (this is) rapid testing that would allow singapore to bring covid-19 \ntesting to the forefront, into primary care, and into the community.\u201d he said.

At the end of 2019, China's World Health Organization WHO reported a pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause from Wuhan. A week later, researchers identified a novel virus as the cause: they called it 2019-NCOV. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. Meanwhile, it is known as SARS COV-2 (COV stands for coronavirus, SARS for a respiratory disease triggered by a similar pathogen). SARS-COV-2 could have spread from a food market in Wuhan. There, exotic animals like reptiles were also sold. The pulmonary disease that \nThe new virus can trigger, is now referred to as Covid-19 (English for Coronavirus Disease; Coronavirus Disease). The disease is a so-called zoonose - a plague through a pathogen from the animal kingdom. Parts of virus bodies of SARS COV-2 same pathogens affecting bats. The new virus could have been transferred to humans via a still unknown intermediary. Both the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as well as Mers (MIDDLE East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses which have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more than 750 died. With the Mers virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. In total there are several hundred types of coronaviren. Many of them affect the respiratory tract and can cause colds. Medizors and physicians assume that the virus is transmitted above all about droplet infection from person to person. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals. More than 200,000 cases of Corona worldwide (as of March 18th) were now registered. Added to this is a high number of dark figure, the researchers roughly suspect somewhere between 50 and 80 percent of all cases. Several thousand people have demonstrably died worldwide. In most, the infection is very mild. Among the deaths are mainly people with severe pre-existence and older people. The course of the registered cases in Germany can be tracked here on this map. The number of infected worldwide, which have been positively tested on Corona, shows this map of Johns-Hopkins University. That can not be said yet. The WHO announced on January 28, that about one-fifth of the persons filed as an infected persons through the virus will be severely ill, so in case of doubt should be treated intensive care. Meanwhile, the WHO classifies the disease as a pandemic. Diverse states have imposed entry and outgoing restrictions to slow the spread. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. States around the world have now reported infection cases, including Germany. Researchers are currently working on therapies and vaccination. The first clinical trials with vaccines have begun, that is, a few patients are tested by testing. China's state and party leader Xi Jinping spoke the day before the \"largest health crisis\" since the foundation of 1949. He called for energetic measures to control the epidemic.

strain, as they did not know that it existed and could cause disease in humans until the outbreak. \n work on vaccines for severe coronaviruses has historically begun once the viruses start infecting humans. \n developing a vaccine involves designing the vaccine constructs \u2013 for example, producing the right target antigens, viral proteins that are targeted by the immune system, followed by testing in animal models to show that they are protective and safe. \n once safety and efficacy are established, vaccines can advance into clinical trials in humans. if the vaccines induce the expected immune response and protection and are found safe, they can be mass produced for vaccination of the population. \n what more needed to develop a vaccine \n currently, we lack virus isolates \u2013 or samples of the virus \u2013 to test the vaccines against. we also lack antibodies to make sure the vaccine is in good shape. \n  \n we need the virus in order to test if the immune response induced by the vaccine works. \n we would also have to establish what animals to test the vaccine on. that potentially could include mice and nonhuman primates. vaccine development will also likely take months. \n dealing with future outbreaks \n we expect that these types of outbreaks will occur for the foreseeable future in irregular intervals. \n to try to prevent large outbreaks and pandemics, we need to improve surveillance in both humans and animals worldwide as well as invest in risk assessment, allowing scientists to evaluate the potential threat of detected viruses. \n given that this is the third major outbreak of a new coronavirus that we have had in the past two decades and the severity of the resulting diseases such as mers and sars, we should consider investing in the development of a vaccine that would be broadly protective against these viruses. \n we believe that global action is needed to invest in novel vaccine approaches that can be employed quickly whenever a new virus like the current coronavirus \u2013 and also viruses similar to zika, ebola or influenza \u2013 emerges. \n currently, responses to emerging pathogens are mostly reactive, meaning they start after the outbreak happens. we need a more proactive approach supported by continuous funding. \n aubree gordon is professor of public health at the university of michigan. florian krammer

", "label": 1}, {"content": "can touching a doorknob lead to infection? experts weigh in on this and other questions. the coronavirus, which originated in wuhan, has affected more than 20,000 people in china and killed at least 425 people. in singapore, there is now local transmission, as four of the six new cases announced on tuesday (feb 4) did not travel to china. in total, there are now 24 confirmed cases in singapore, and the government has warned that there could be broader community spread.   senior health correspondent joyce teo asked two infectious disease experts for their take on the latest developments in this outbreak. they are professor wang lin fa, the director of the emerging infectious disease programme at duke-nus medical school, and associate professor hsu li yang, the programme head (infectious diseases) at the nus saw swee hock school of public health.   a recent report said that the coronavirus has been found on a doorknob in the house of an infected person.   experts have said this virus is transmitted mostly via droplets, and there can be contact transmission when these droplets land on a surface and one then picks up the infection from touching the surface. prof wang said that he personally thinks the risk of contact transmission is higher than that of direct droplet transmission.   \"you have to be very unlucky to get it from the droplets in the air; it means that the person coughed directly at your face, or very near you, or if an infected person coughed in the lift about 30 seconds before you went in,\" he said.   the risk of infection in singapore is considered very low but for ordinary people who want to protect themselves, the first thing they can do is to avoid crowded places.   \"and if you really have to go out, the lifts and the public toilets, these are the places where i would be very, very careful about touching any surfaces to not risk a coronavirus infection,\" said prof wang.   if someone used the lift 30 seconds or a minute before you, there's a \"low chance\" of you getting an infection from breathing in the air but a much higher chance of getting it from contact, that is, from touching the lift buttons.   \"everybody's wearing a mask but they are not doing anything to protect their hands,\" he said. \"the lift is the most dangerous place\u00a0because it is an enclosed space, and everybody has to touch the button to go up or down, or to close the door.\"   one tip he's learnt from social media is to use a pen to press the lift buttons. get one with a cap and remove the ink cartridge before using it. after using it, cap it and put it in your bag.   cars are also enclosed spaces. prof wang said that people can use a hand sanitiser after getting in and out of a car or cab. drivers can air the vehicle after dropping a passenger off.   \"if a previous passenger is infected and let's say, he coughed in the car five minutes ago, and you then open the windows for two to three minutes, you should get enough circulation to clear the air because the droplets \ncannot stay in the air for so long if it's a fully ventilated environment.\"   recent reports have discussed this. prof wang said this is possible and said that during the sars outbreak in hong kong in 2003, more than 300 people at an apartment complex called amoy gardens reportedly caught the disease through the sewage system. it was reported then that the moist conditions in the bathrooms in amoy gardens had allowed water droplets containing the virus to form. bathroom extractor fans then sucked the virus into the flats, spreading it. singapore has a different sewage system.   at the complex, sars was also apparently spread through person-to-person contact and in common areas, such as lifts, lobbies and staircases.   there have been confirmed cases of people in their 30s and 40s; the first person to die from the coronavirus in hong kong is a 39-year-old who had travelled to wuhan. he had an underlying illness.   prof wang said some 80 per cent to 90 per cent of the severe or fatal cases are either the elderly or those with underlying medical conditions.   what these people - the elderly and those with serious underlying medical conditions - can do is to avoid crowded places and stay at home as much as possible, he said.   prof wang, who is 59, said he has been on a self-imposed home quarantine\u00a0after returning from wuhan in mid-january.   experts have been quoted in media reports saying that the coronavirus outbreak looks increasingly like a pandemic. a pandemic is when a disease is prevalent in a whole country or the world.   \"we do not know for sure yet. the 2019-ncov is much harder to contain compared with\u00a0sars, but china has instituted outbreak control measures on a scale that has dwarfed all other efforts in the past,\" said prof hsu, using the scientific name for the coronavirus.   \"even if the epidemic is eventually brought under control, it is likely that this will take a far longer period than sars (which was nine months). if we have a commercially available and effective vaccine in over a year, that will be most helpful.\"   there is talk that the virus spreads more easily in cold weather.   prof hsu said that cold, dry air does result in better spread of the flu virus and human coronaviruses, which is why the influenza season typically coincides with winter every year.   \"we do not know enough about the new virus to be sure, but it is plausible that the same is true,\" he said.   nevertheless, he added: \"singapore is in the tropics and does not have winter, and we also have influenza all year round.\" ", "label": 1}, {"content": "Coronavirus has killed 904 people.

a critical shortage of reliable laboratory tests for the coronavirus, hobbling the federal response as the pandemic spread across the country like wildfire, an associated press review found. president donald trump assured americans early this month that the covid-19 test developed by the centers for disease control and prevention is \"perfect\" and that \"anyone who wants a test can get a test.\" but more than two months after the first u.s. case of the new disease was confirmed, many people still cannot get tested. in the critical month of february, as the virus began taking root in the u.s. population, cdc data shows government labs processed 352 covid-19 tests -- an average of only a dozen per day. \"you cannot fight a fire blindfolded,\" tedros adhanom ghebreyesus, head of the world health organization, said at a recent briefing. \"we cannot stop this pandemic if we don\u2019t know who is infected.\" the department of health and human services, which includes the cdc, has begun an internal review to assess its own mistakes. but outside observers and federal health officials have pointed to four primary issues that together hampered the national response -- the early decision not to use the test adopted by the world health organization, flaws with the more complex test developed by the cdc, government guidelines restricting who could be tested and delays in engaging the private sector to ramp up testing capacity. combined with messaging from the white house minimizing the disease, that fueled a lackluster response that missed chances to slow the spread of the virus, they said. \"there were many, many opportunities not to end up where we are,\" dr. ashish k. jha, the director of the global health institute at harvard, told the ap. \"basically, they took this as business as usual. ... and that\u2019s because the messaging from the white house was 'this is not a big deal, this is no worse than the flu.\u2019 so that message basically created no sense of urgency within the fda or the cdc to fix it.\" even as private labs have been cleared by government regulators to process tens of thousands of additional tests in the last two weeks, experts warn that the nation is still falling well short of enough testing capacity to keep ahead of the highly contagious virus. and it can often take a week just to get results back. trump last week rated his administration\u2019s response to the crisis as a perfect 10. however, dr. anthony fauci, the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, said the cdc's system wasn't designed to test for and track a widespread outbreak, which he characterized as \"a failing.\" in interviews with the ap, two federal health officials with direct knowledge of the situation said cdc experts don't know why many of the agency\u2019s test kits failed to reliably detect the virus. the officials spoke on the condition of \nanonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about what went wrong. j. stephen morrison, a health policy expert at the center for strategic and international studies in washington, called the testing issues a debacle, contributing to what he described as a confused and delayed federal response to the crisis. as a result, he said, the cdc has now been marginalized within the white house -- a worrisome development. \"cdc has generally been regarded as the best in the game,\" morrison said. \"i don\u2019t think they anticipated the technical difficulty or the speed with which the virus has been moving. the virus was racing out ahead of them.\" fateful decisions on new year\u2019s eve, chinese scientists informed the world health organization about a cluster of 27 pneumonia cases of unknown cause in the industrial megalopolis of wuhan that they linked to the city\u2019s wholesale fish market. less than two weeks later, the chinese had sequenced the virus\u2019 genetic makeup and shared it with the world. within days, german scientists had developed a test that could identify a unique part of the virus' dna. the who quickly adopted the german test, publishing technical guidelines on jan. 17 and working with private companies to produce testing kits. as they have done with some past outbreaks, officials at the cdc headquarters in atlanta decided to develop their own test, focusing on three gene targets distinct from what the who used. over the decades, the headquarters lab had built a track record of being among the first to develop tests for new diseases and quickly making them available for disease tracking. the cdc published the technical details for its covid-19 test on jan. 28, 10 days after the who. by then, the virus had already been in the u.s. for at least two weeks. the 35-year-old man who would become the first american to test positive had arrived in seattle on jan. 15, following a trip to wuhan. after swabs from his nose and throat were flown to the cdc lab, federal officials announced the results jan. 21. in an interview on cnbc the following day, the republican president was asked about the risk to the nation. \"we have it totally under control,\" he said. \"it\u2019s one person coming in from china. ... it\u2019s going to be just fine.\" with limited capacity at the cdc lab in atlanta, the agency placed strict criteria on who could be tested: people with fevers, coughing or difficulty breathing who had also visited wuhan within the preceding two weeks or who had close contact with someone already confirmed or under investigation for having the virus. on jan. 30, the day the who declared the outbreak a public health emergency, trump again assured the american people that the virus was very well under control. then he departed for a weekend at his mar-a-lago club in florida, where he tweeted a photo of himself playing golf at his club in west palm beach. \"getting a little exercise this morning!\" the president wrote. the following day, the u.s. declared its own \nemergency. still, u.s. citizens returning from china who did not have a fever weren\u2019t tested for the virus but were encouraged to self-quarantine at home for 14 days. at that point, the cdc had confirmed just eight cases of covid-19 in the u.s. the agency amended its testing criteria to include people with fevers who had traveled to china, rather than just wuhan. flawed test kits four days after the u.s. declared a state of emergency, only 178 patients had been tested and 82 others were listed as \"pending,\" meaning they were awaiting final results, according to cdc data released at the time. to help increase the number of people being screened, the food and drug administration issued emergency authorization for cdc-certified labs run by state health departments to begin processing swabs, and they were provided with kits that could test 250 patients. as the first tests were processed at the state labs, technicians reported getting inconclusive results, which the cdc has said could be due to the test looking for signs of generic coronaviruses, of which there are many, rather than the specific virus that causes covid-19. whatever the reason, by mid-february, only about a half-dozen state and local public health labs had reliable tests. but still, cdc director dr. robert redfield continued to insist his agency had developed \"a very accurate test.\" \"we found that, in some of the states, it didn\u2019t work,\" redfield said earlier this month. \"we figured out why. i don\u2019t consider that a fault. i consider that doing quality control. i consider that success.\" the testing problems emerged just as the cdc broadened its criteria to include patients who were \"severely ill\" with covid-19 symptoms \"even if a known source of exposure has not been identified.\" as more sick people sought to be tested, many states were forced to limit access because of the flawed cdc test. accounts began to emerge through social media of people with all the symptoms of covid-19 who either couldn\u2019t get tested or had test results delayed by days or even a week. \"i know of doctor friends of mine who have critically ill patients in the icu, and we don\u2019t know if they have covid or not because we can\u2019t get a test,\" jha said last week. community transmission on feb. 24, exasperated officials at the association of public health laboratories sent a letter to the fda, basically asking permission for state labs to develop their own tests. within days, the fda reversed its previous position and said both public and private labs could conduct testing. trump continued to insist the virus would die out on its own. \"one day, it\u2019s like a miracle. it will disappear,\" he predicted feb. 27. by then, experts say, the opportunity to halt the relentless spread of the virus within the u.s. population had been lost. on feb. 29, only 472 patients had been tested nationwide, with just 22 cases confirmed, according to cdc data. of those, nine cases were not related to travel but had spread person-to-person within \nthe u.s. by comparison, south korea had its first confirmed case of covid-19 on jan. 20, the same day as the u.s. officials there used a test that focused on the same gene targets as the who test, according to the website of a test manufacturer. they then quickly permitted private-sector labs to run the samples. as a result, a nation with less than one-sixth the population of the u.s. mobilized to test more than 20,000 people a day. south korea also instituted drive-thru centers, allowing quicker identification of those who were infected but might not be displaying symptoms, thus slowing the emergence of new cases to a more manageable level. meanwhile, the rate of u.s. infections soared. \"the system is not really geared to what we need right now, what you are asking for,\" fauci conceded during a congressional hearing earlier this month. \"that is a failing. let's admit it.\" shifting blame as public outrage over the lack of available u.s. tests grew, the fda announced it would allow private diagnostic lab companies to produce new tests without preauthorization from regulators. trump and hhs secretary alex azar visited the cdc lab in atlanta on march 6, praising the agency\u2019s performance and promising 4 million test kits would be available by the end of the following week. that lofty number didn't match the ability of u.s. labs to process tests, however. private providers were just then ramping up, while cdc and state health labs processed about 25,200 covid-19 tests in the following seven days, according to cdc data. at the same news conference, trump said he wanted infected passengers to remain on a cruise ship off the west coast to keep the number of confirmed covid-19 cases in the u.s. low. \"i like the numbers being where they are,\" trump said, shortly before departing atlanta for another weekend of golf in florida. \"i don\u2019t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn\u2019t our fault.\" trump has also attempted to mislay blame for the testing troubles on the obama administration. in 2018, trump disbanded the white house directorate charged with preparing for and responding to global pandemics. \"i don't take responsibility at all,\" trump replied when asked about the testing shortfall in a march 13 briefing at the white house. morrison said trump appears to see the virus as a political issue rather than a public health threat. \"you can imagine a white house that said, 'do whatever it takes to test everybody for the virus,\u2019\" he said. \"that wasn\u2019t the mentality. it was the opposite mentality, and ultimately the responsibility to protect the american people lies with the white house.\" trump and other officials have falsely said they declined to use the who test because it isn't reliable. \"quality testing for our american people is paramount to us,\" deborah birx, who is coordinating the u.s. coronavirus response, said last week. \"it doesn\u2019t help to put out a test where 50% or 47% are false positives.\" \"it was a bad test,\" trump chimed in. \ntarik jaarevi, a who spokesman, told the ap last week that his agency had shipped 1.5 million testing kits manufactured in germany to 120 countries around the globe, with no such problems emerging. \"the test has been validated in three external laboratories, adapted by who and manufactured in line with international quality standards,\" he said. \"it has shown consistently good performance in laboratory and clinical use, and neither a significant number of false-positive nor false-negative results have been reported.\" over the past two weeks, u.s. testing capacity has surged, with private companies joining in. labcorp began providing tests march 5, and quest diagnostics followed four days later. tests also are being conducted at hospitals and other centers. with the increased testing has come a skyrocketing number of confirmed cases, zooming from 43 at the beginning of march to 33,404 by monday. only in the last few days has the united states finally begun testing more people each day than far smaller south korea, according to data complied by johns hopkins university. jha estimates the u.s. should be testing 100,000 to 150,000 people per day -- figures he said should be obtainable given the number of high-quality diagnostic labs in the country. \"we certainly have the capacity. it\u2019s just we\u2019re not doing it,\" jha said thursday. \"we are up to about 40,000 tests per day now -- and so we are moving in the right direction. still far from where we need to be, but moving.\" ", "label": 1}, {"content": "potential coronavirus treatment touted

At this moment it has the second largest number of infected after China and the fourth largest number of mortal victims, following China, Italy and Iran. Central element in Korean situation is a church so far little known outside the country, Shincheonji, or, Church of Jesus, the Temple of the Testimony Tabernacle. It is one of many sects that exist in the mostly non-religious country, but where Christianity remains the most practiced religion, followed by Buddhism. The role of Shincheonji in the epidemic became known when a 61-year-old woman had a car accident and was hospitalized. Days later, it was found that she was infected. As her story was investigated, she was noticed that she was a member of the Church and she had participated in masses and eaten at a buffet. The number of people she infected, to which it all indicates, was substantial. Speak up in about forty people, which in turn will have infected many more. As the woman was the 31st person to be identified with the virus, nicknamed her \"patient 31\" and quickly began to be the subject of vilification. But it was not only her fault. Many of her actions, including the fact that she has not revealed symptoms that were already percetivable to him, correspond to what is normal in her church. Shincheonji requires its members to attend services even when they are sick. Prayers are made with members very close to each other, and are prohibited from using mask in the temple, because it considers that this offends God. Above all, the Church encourages followers to hide their member condition, in part to facilitate the practices of subreptic proselytism that have made it seen as one of the most aggressive sects in the country, and even out, including China. Although this country prohibits missionaries, Shincheonji seems to have had enough success. The now triggered epidemic departed from a Temple of Shincheonji situated in Daegu, a city in the south of the country. Chinese members from the Chinese city of Wuhan - the original focus of Covid-19 - may be at the origin of the outbreak. Anyway, the epidemic did not take time to spread, reaching sometimes unexpected targets. One of the surprises was to discover that the director of the city's infectious disease prevention service was a member of the sect and was infected, such as a police and a teacher of a school. When the patient's case 31 was reported and the criticism began, the Church instructed the faithful to disobey government orders and hide that they were members. In a message he wrote in an internal application of the Church, Lee Man-Hee said, \"This case of disease is seen as the work of the Demon to stop the rapid growth of Shincheonji. As the evidence that Job went through, it is to destroy our advance \". Shincheonji is now accused of having prevented the \nAuthorities monitor and isolate infected people. Only after the authorities searching church facilities, taking computers with the list of members, is that the Church finally made available the names, ensuring that I was doing everything to help the authorities. Shincheojin was founded in 1984 by Lee Man-Hee, a man currently at the age of 88 who claims to be the reincarnation of Christ and promises to take 144,000 faithful to Heaven with him. At this time, the Church has more than 245,000 members, and a few more tens of thousands in other countries. In China, it is considered the most aggressive Christian sect, by the habit that has to infiltrate other religious groups and recruit between them. Former Church members have described a typical recruitment process. They are approached by friendly and jovial people who propose to live with them, often without referring their belonging to that Church, or even denying that they belong to some. When the recruit potential is already captivated, they suggest that it participates in some activity, for example a Bible study, and the process is advancing. If recruitment is realized, the new member has the same obligations of others, including recruiting actively. Many members are people who were in situations of relative emotional helplessness and are looking for that they are always surrounded by church friends to support and mainly to ensure that they are monitored permanence. Monitoring are known as \"eyes\", and new members as \"new fruit\" or \"new fruits\". With ten thousand activity missionaries - the largest number after the United States - South Korea is fertile ground for sects. Over the decades, they have not missed scandals to wrap them. One of the notorious cases of recent years led to the resignation of President Park Geun-Hye in 2016 in a case of corruption in which one of the protagonists was a friend, daughter of the founder of a shamanic sect, the church of eternal life, which negotiated sales political decisions through bribes. Another case happened in 2014, when the sinking of a ferry killed 304 people, mostly children. It was not delayed that the leader of such a Baptist evangelical church had converted the ship in a way that had left him without minimum safety conditions. Still last July, the leader of an apocalyptic worship was arrested for kidnapping, spanking and enslaving hundreds of his followers. And there have also been sex scandals, with leaders who sexually abused members for a long time. A Busan teacher who studies the sects, Tark Ji-IL, explained to the \"South China Morning Post\" that the appeal has a lot to do with the succession of tragedies that reached the country during the twentieth century. First the Japanese occupation, then the civil war, and finally the military dictatorship: \"The Church spoke of the kingdom of the heavens, but the cults promised the kingdom on earth and the imminent end of the world, so that everything could change.\" All this to the mix with appeals \nNationalists, for salvation is presented as something directed and destined for Koreans.

", "label": 1}, {"content": "coronavirus. As the Chinese political system worsened the disaster. Xu Zhangrun is a law professor at the University of Tsinghua, Beijing, by chance the same where he studied President Xi Jinping. For days, he published on the Internet a text that relates poor coronavirus management with the repressive characteristics of the Chinese political system. It is not a new theme, especially after the death of Li Wenliang, the doctor who was the first to warn colleagues for the existence of the new virus, having been rewarded with a police visit to admonish it, along with seven other professionals who They made alerts on social networks. The text of Xu, titled \"Angry people are no longer afraid\", makes a vehement appeal to freedom of expression, the type of position that in China, when expressed publicly, usually leads people to jail. It's probably what XU will happen, even for it already having a background. In 2018, he published another text to criticize the end of the limit of two terms for the country's maximum leader - an amendment to the Constitution made expressly to benefit Xi Jinping. Following this text, he was forbidden to teach classes and to travel, besides having been deprived of a substantial part of his salary. Now, the consequences may be worse. China has allowed an unusual degree of public criticism since the coronavirus crisis began, but this tolerance should not last long. New instructions have already been adopted to \"strengthen the orientation of public opinion\" and, judging by previous examples, repression will soon intensify, knowing that the Internet is used by the government as a vast apparatus of control of its citizens . The Paradox of China is that, on the one hand, the system allows you to take measures that in other countries would be difficult or impossible - close entire cities, build hospitals in days - but, on the other hand, by preventing the circulation of information, It helps the scourges spread before it is possible to contain them in the origin. This is one of the key ideas in the XU article. On the other hand, its description of how the growing concentration of power led to a degradation of the efficiency of the national bureaucracy reflects, at Chinese scale, a phenomenon that many people know other levels in their daily life: the practice of shaking responsibilities And to blame who is underneath is the perfect stimulus so that no one knows a problem when it begins, with effects that can be fatal, not always in the figured sense, as you can see now. XU explains that \"censorship increases day after day and its impact is to weaken and obliterate those things they could and should have a positive role to alert society for critical issues. In response to coronavirus, for example, authorities began to shut up public restlessness and the comment open through censorship; The following simply closed entire cities. \" \"The current chaos in Wuhan launched Hubei in the confusion,\" he continues, \"but the root of the \nExpansion Problem is in Beijing: the one who dedicates himself energetically to 'protect the mountains and rivers and keep dominion over the mountains and rivers'. That is, Xi Jinping (Xu never refers directly by name, designing it in different ways). \"The end result of your leadership style is, according to Internet commentators have repaired a lot lately, which, although 'great tasks can be carried out concentrating power', in times of crisis 'large nonserves are also generated by an overly concentrated power'. Coronavirus is a clear demonstration of this. \" These are extraordinarily critical, in the Chinese context, and perhaps only explained by the fact that China is feeling coronavirus damage to many levels, from health exactly related to circulation limitations, the virtual banishment of Chinese travelers that many countries apply , and economic damage that the country and many people are suffering. all this puts into question the image of infinite wisdom that Xi Jinping has grown since he amounted to power in 2012. But when Xu almost troits the way the president seeks to associate directly to the fight against the scourge (\"he has poked a lot Personally this' and 'personally', empty words that only serve to underline hypocrisy \"), criticism assumes a personal tone that makes it particularly risky. Xu does not ignore him. \"Everyone is aware that online terror can easily escape the virtual realm and become openly physical,\" she writes. \"It's the cases where the authorities use what they knew online and send the police to deal with internauts in real time. The enlarged social restlessness that follows stimulates an atmosphere of constant self-censorship and people are afflicted by constant fears on what inexplicable punishment will fall on top at a given time. This is how all potential for public discussion is muffled. In the same way, the communication channels themselves, which under normal circumstances should exist to disseminate public information, are strangled and a significant civic system of rapid warning, which should play a crucial role in local or national emergency heights, is illegalized. \" Just so, it is important to speak. In a visibly erudito text that often resorts the references of traditional Chinese culture, the most important never walks away. \"At the moment I write, in the city of Wuhan and inside the province of Hubei, there are still countless numbers of people who failed to receive adequate medical attention and that they have been abandoned in desperate insulation,\" says Xu. \"How can we know how many were sentenced to premature death as a result?\" \"It is a system that transforms any natural disaster into a man-made even more catastrophe,\" sums up. \"The coronavirus epidemic revealed the rotten nucleus of Chinese governance: the fragile and empty heart of the unstable state of the state was \nSo by shows like never before. \" In another part of the text, it uses the expression \"systemic impotence\".

coronavirus, yet a month's lockdown in stricken malaysia where three of every five gloves are made has upended the supply chain and threatens to hamstring hospitals worldwide.    the world's biggest maker of medical gloves by volume, top glove corp bhd <tpgc.kl>, has the capacity to make 200 million gloves a day, but a supplier shutdown has left it with only two weeks' worth of boxes to ship them in, its founder told reuters.    \"we can't get our gloves to hospitals without cartons,\" executive chairman lim wee chai said in an interview. \"hospitals need our gloves. we can't just supply 50% of their requirement.\"    the virus, which emerged in china at the end of last year, has left malaysia with the highest number of infections in southeast asia at nearly 1,800 cases, with 17 deaths. to halt transmission, the government has ordered people to stay home from march 18 to april 14.    glove makers and others eligible for exemption can operate half-staffed provided they meet strict safety conditions. still, the malaysian rubber glove manufacturers association (margma) said it was lobbying \"almost every hour\" to return the industry to full strength to minimise risk to the global fight.    \"we're shut down,\" said evonna lim, managing director at packaging supplier etheos imprint technology. \"we fall under an exempted category but still need approval.\"    dr celine gounder, an infectious diseases specialist at the new york university school of medicine, said she was using up to six times as many gloves as normal each day due to the number of patients with covid-19, the illness caused by the virus.    \"if we get to the point where there is a shortage of gloves, that's going to be a huge problem because then we cannot draw blood safely, we cannot do

states lifted a ban on imports from malaysian glove maker wrp asia pacific who it had previously accused of using forced labour.    britain's department of health & social care has urged malaysian authorities to prioritise the production and shipment of gloves that are of \"utmost criticality for fighting covid-19,\" showed a letter dated march 20 to glove maker supermax corp <supm.kl> and shared with reuters.    margma is considering rationing due to the \"extremely high demand,\" its president denis low said. \"you can produce as many gloves as you can but then there's nothing to pack them into.\"    under normal circumstances, top glove can meet less than 40% of its own packaging needs. for the \nremainder, it said just 23% of suppliers have gained approval to operate at half strength.    \"we are lobbying almost every hour, we are putting in a lot of letters to the ministry,\" said low. \"we are lobbying hard for the chemical suppliers and we want to ensure that the printers are also being given approval and any other supporting services, even transportation.\"    malaysia's ministry of international trade and industry on tuesday said it had received masses of applications to operate through the lockdown, and that it was seeking cooperation from industries to give way to those producing essential goods.       automation    developed economies are home to only a fifth of the world's population yet account for nearly 70% medical glove demand due to stringent medical standards. at 150, u.s. glove consumption per-capita is 20 times that of china, latest margma data showed.    margma expects demand to jump 16% to 345 billion gloves this year, with malaysia's market share rising two percentage points to 65%. thailand usually follows at about 18% and china at 9%.    top glove said orders have doubled since february and it sees sales rising by a fifth in the next six months. its stock, with a market value of about $3.5 billion, has risen by a third this year versus a fall of 16% in the wider market <.klse>.    the company, with customers in 195 economies, registered the highest net money inflow last week among listed malaysian firms, along with peer hartalega holdings bhd <hthb.kl>, showed midf research data. other glove makers include kossan rubber industries bhd <krib.kl> and careplus group bhd <care.kl>.    \"we are fortunate enough to be in essential goods,\" said lim. \"these few months and at least the next six months will be an all-time high in terms of sales volume, revenue and profit.\"    with more than 80% of its 44 factories worldwide automated, top glove itself is less impacted by the lockdown than its more labour-intensive domestic suppliers. packaging woes aside, however, ramping up production could turn under-supply into over-supply when the coronavirus outbreak finally subsides.    \"this outbreak will create awareness and make humankind healthier,\" said lim. \"people will pay more attention, they will invest more, they will buy more so demand will be more.\" reuters ", "label": 1}, {"content": "coronavirus: what you should know. hakim hayatas anxiety mounts worldwide over a novel coronavirus that started last month in wuhan, a central chinese city, the virus has spread across china and to at least 15 other countries, including neighbouring singapore and malaysia.in view of the seriousness of the situation and in a bid to arrest the spread of this virus, the world health organization (who) has come out with some basic guidelines, including the stepping up of hygienic measures, and avoiding affected countries.in china, fatalities from the pneumonia-inducing virus hit the 170 mark yesterday and more than 7,700 cases confirmed, leading to an unprecedented lockdown of tens of millions of people in affected areas.while there have been no deaths reported outside china so far, brunei fortunately has not seen a single case of the virus and lastweek, a chinese traveller who was quarantined for showing flu symptoms was cleared of the virus following checks by the ministry of health (moh).alarm over domestic transmission grew when the third and fourth confirmed patients \u2013 both of whom travelled directly from wuhan \u2013 presented no outward symptoms at the time of arrival, and passed through the airport thermal screening without detection.china\u2019s national health commission said last sunday that asymptomatic spread of the virus was possible during the incubation period, which is believed to be up to 14 days. as the virus is new, there is currently no vaccine or cure, with many questions waiting to be answered.the following are what health authorities and experts say about the wuhan coronavirus, and simple precautionary steps to reduce the risk of contraction and transmission.what do you need to know about the coronavirus?the new flu-like virus, 2019-ncov, is a coronavirus, a family of pathogens that causes respiratory illness, according to the who. there are now seven known types of coronaviruses, ranging widely in severity from the common cold to more lethal strains such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars), or middle east respiratory syndrome (mers).what are the symptoms?in mild or moderate cases of the coronavirus, symptoms are similar to a cold or the flu \u2013 runny nose, coughing, sore throat, fever and muscle pain or fatigue. in patients with weakened immune systems, it can cause lower-respiratory tract illnesses such as pneumonia and respiratory failure. the who situation report released last tuesday said about 20 per cent of those infected fell severely ill.how is the virus transmitted, and how contagious is it?since its outbreak at the end last december, the number of confirmed patients has risen to nearly 6,000 globally, and the number of suspected patients is even higher.the us centre for disease control and prevention (cdc) said it is mainly spread through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, much like how other respiratory pathogens are spread. the possibility of airborne transmission is not yet \nclear.is it deadly?figures provided by chinese authorities show the virus\u2019 fatality rate is about two to three per cent. as there is no antiviral therapy for this particular virus, treatment efforts are largely supportive. the viral pneumonia may leave permanent lung damage, in more severe cases.how can we avoid contracting the virus?according to a health advisory issued by the moh, hygiene is key, such as the regular washing of hands with water and soap, using masks during a bout of cold or flu, covering the mouth with tissue while coughing or sneezing, and disposing of soiled tissues after use. as a precautionary measure, the public is advised to avoid contact with sick livestock and poultry as well as consuming raw or improperly cooked meat.coughing etiquette also matters. when coughing or sneezing, your mouth and nose should be covered with a tissue or your upper sleeve, not your hands. although some medical journals such as the international journal of infectious diseases report debate the effects of masks, they are said to help limit exposure to and transmission of the virus. the report advises masks should not be worn more than once or twice, and they should be discarded with caution.what to do if you feel that you have the symptoms?the moh has urged those who develop symptoms to seek treatment if feeling unwell and to avoid direct contact with those who display symptoms.in its recent press release, the ministry said it will continue to maintain high levels of preparedness and work closely with the who, as well as other countries in the region, to control the situation.the ministry also said that among the steps taken are to re-introduce the use of body temperature checks for passengers arriving in the country via brunei international airport, particularly from cities in china, starting on january 21, improved implementation of the standard operating procedure (sop) in government clinics and hospitals, and ongoing monitoring and risk assessment of the condition of the infection worldwide.

", "label": 1}, {"content": "France confirms third case by coronavirus. The French authorities have registered a third person who has infected with the novel coronavirus originated from China. According to Health Minister Agn\u00e8s Buzyn, it is a close relative of one of the two persons in which the new lung disease was previously diagnosed. All three patients had previously been held in China and were isolated in hospitals. It is examined by whom she could have been in contact. At the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities of the World Health Organization WHO reported an accumulation of pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause in the Central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the diseases. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days then a group released a group of the virologen Christian's premier from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 the first diagnostic test for the new virus, the researcher provisionally call 2019-NCOV. With the test, the virus can be detected in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, on which, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected. Both the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as well as Mers (MIDDLE East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses which have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more than 750 died. With the MERS virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronaviruses. Many of them relate to respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example. In China, several thousand persons are suffering from them, some of them - most of them with pre-existing conditions - have died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first infection cases outside of China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been in Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection with a tourist, who came back from Wuhan, on January 24, the first cases were known in France. Meanwhile, first cases were confirmed in Germany. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. The virus can cause pneumonia that can endally end. Since it is a viral illness, antibiotics do not help. Meanwhile, it is clear that the virus can be transferred from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transfers after a dozen cases were known in medical staff. \nMedizors assume that the virus is transmitted above all over droplet infection. The World Health Organization calculates, as announced on January 24, at the moment that an infected one cuts 1.4 to 2.5 other people. Contest these numbers, the virus is less contagious than SARS and also the viral flu. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals. That can not be said yet. The World Health Organization said on 28 January that about one-fifth of the reported cases through the virus will be seriously ill, so in case of doubt must be treated intensive care. According to reports, the first death pots were patients who had some severe pre-existing conditions. Even with other infectious diseases, people with pre-existing diseases are particularly endangered - for example at the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so change their genome. This can cause you to become more dangerous for people in the course of an outbreak - but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) expects no similar mortality to the current time as the outbreak of SARS. In the US, too, another person is suffering from an infection with the virus that can lead to serious pneumonia. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, a woman from Chicago was brought into a hospital. The woman had reported a few days after her return from a China trip with complaints to her doctor. Previously, a case in Seattle had been confirmed in the USA. The novel virus named 2019-NCOV was discovered for the first time in December 2019 on a now closed fish and poultry market in the Chinese city of Wuhan. The coronavirus triggers a respiratory disease that can lead to pulmonary inflammation. According to previous findings, the virus can also be transferred from person to person. For fear of another distribution of the virus - this Saturday, millions of Chinese are on the occasion of the Chinese New Year's festival - the Chinese government has arranged nationwide measures for trains, aircraft and buses. As the national health authority communicated, measuring stations are set up throughout public transport. Passengers with suspected infection would have to be brought to a medical device \"immediately\". Previously, whole cities had been isolated. The metropolises of Wuhan, Huanggang, Xiantao and Ezhou and the smaller Chibi and now the cities of Xianning, Xiaogan, Enshi and Zhijiang are truncated by the outside world. Public traffic was exposed. In total, thirteen Chinese cities are now under quarantine, more than 41 \nMillions of inhabitants are affected. The South Chinese city of Haikou had that all travelers from Hubei were in fourteen days in a hotel in a hotel and medically examined. In China, 41 people have died of the consequences of the disease. The Chinese health authorities have registered 1,287 infected information and would check several thousand suspected cases. According to calculations by Experts of Imperial College London, the number of infections should be much higher; They go out of 4,000 infected people. Outside China, cases in Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam and Australia were also confirmed. Also from Nepal was reported on Friday a first case. All affected had been previously in Wuhan. The President of the Robert Koch Institute relativized the global danger through the new coronavirus. \"Outside of China, there are no major infection chains,\" said Lothar Wieler on Friday evening in the Journal of ZDF today. However, the microbiologist emphasized, one could not judge the severity of the disease caused by the virus. \"We have no complete information,\" Wieler said. Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU) memorized to behave prudent. \"We take that very seriously, we are alert, but with cool head also at the same time,\" said the CDU politician in the ARD daily topics. You are in daily exchange with experts. \"I also think that we can classify the as a whole that we can go with the necessary peace.\" The Foreign Office calls China travelers to read the safety instructions of the Ministry of Health before departure.

According to a statement from the spokesman for the United States Embassy in Beijing, the evacuation order responded to the expansion of the Coronavirus and the logistical interruptions derived from restrictions on restricted transport and overflow in hospitals in the city. Another concern of diplomats was that any suspects to contract the coronavirus can be isolated in an indefinite quarantine, probably without access to consular assistance.\nThe US government negotiated with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China and other Government agencies of the Asian giant to achieve the evacuation.

The current pandemic Covid-19 comes to mark an important inflection point in the growing trust and optimism of recent years. At a time when predictions for 2020 were no longer optimistic, denoting signs of a synchronized slowdown on a global scale, Vovid-19 came to catalyze this reaction, disseminating what seems to have started in a market in China in a nearly right imminent global economic recession. In full was artificial intelligence and digitization, where everything goes very quickly, also epidemics rise to unthinkable rhythms. the particularity of the global world in which we live, where practically no country lives alone, has become the perfect ecosystem for the spread of SARS-COV-2 type virus, and transmission vectors, Production, tourism, migratory flows or free movement. Now where basic principles are concerned, such as health, everything else will have to be referred for the background. However, the analysis and evaluation of its impacts in the economy is left of extreme relevance. resulting from the dissemination of this outbreak, several economic impacts are expected. First, the overall impact of the Chinese economy breaking at least in the first quarters of this year. Then the shock on the supply side, resulting from the failures in the production and absenteeism chains (telecommuting productivity will have to be assessed after this situation we live). But therefore, it is necessary to take due account of the decrease in demand, as a result of greater uncertainty and the postponement of investment decisions. and, finally, the impact already expected in the liquidity of the companies. From a macroeconomic point of view, despite some recent improvements, Portugal presents severe susceptibility, as the order of economists has reiterated either through its quarterly barometer of taxation, both in the various public interventions, and still in the Think-tank mission growth . Our country presents Europe's third debt as a percentage of P.I.B. (119.5%), the weight of interest being the highest second of the European Union, implying excessive exposure to external risks. In addition, the sustainability of public accounts depends on a high tax burden on companies and families, which will see their revenue decrease by automatic stabilizers linked to the decrease in economic activity. In contrast, it is expected that public expenditure, with its rigid character, is higher through the increase (more than necessary, in this period) of health spending, the allocation of additional social benefits or measures to promote economy. Of course, the forecasts included in the OE / 2020 have failed to make sense in the light of the current situation. The growth targets, debt reduction, maintenance of low performance rates, the stability of \nFinancing rates or the long-awaited and festified budget surplus, certainly will not correspond to expectations. This is the most evident demonstration of the highest risk resulting from non-realization of important structural reforms, long identified, but always postponed, even at a time when threats were already visible (the commercial war between China and the US, geopolitical tensions, Brexit or the situation of the Italian financial system). The country is therefore more exposed to external shocks, now adding the unexpected pandemic of Covid-19. of this virus, so feared black swan, beyond the serious and numerous impacts at the health level, has already resulted in the largest psi-20 scholarship in this century, a oil war involving Russia and Saudi Arabia and the growing closure borders by various states. As regards the economic impact, the OECD has already revised the world growth of 2.9% to 2.4%, being the most pessimistic scenario of 1.5% at Europe level, and the European Commission estimated a , 5 percentage points in the face of the initial estimate of growth (1.4% of GDP), setting the new estimate in a possible recession of 1% of GDP. Having all this into account, what can be done to mitigate this economic impact? The answer will have to be given concerted and at European level, a much greater proactivity is required, as well as a strengthening of debt purchase programs, ensuring that the risk of the debt of Southern countries does not rise and can pass through the mutualization of the New debt to be generated at European level. U.E. You can not fail and have an opportunity to show that your ability to resolve a situation like this exists and will be successfully exercised. On the business side, a flexibility of fiscal and credit payments is necessary in order to avoid insolvency of companies for lack of liquidity, as well as the launch of investment support and minimization programs of the costs generated by Cuvid-19. On the side of the families, support must be granted beyond those already announced for cases with a greater number of dependents and less income, as well as greater flexibility in payment of credits to housing, electricity and water. The times we are living are difficult for everyone. also for the policy makers of the various countries plagued by this pandemic. But we can overtake them, working together and in tune. After all, epidemics have a cyclical character and the history of humanity shows us this. And in the end, it is necessary to face the strangeness of the present that we are living with the possible normality, the more not to remind us of the lesson that the swans are not always white. * Basket for economist order ", "label": 1}, {"content": "india in talks with china to provide relief to 250 stuck in wuhan. india on sunday said it is examining 'all options' in consultations with china to provide relief to over 250 stuck indians, mostly students, in wuhan, the epicentre of the fast spreading coronavirus.\n\nindia on sunday opened a third hotline in view of 'large number' of phone calls from the indians who are mostly students, the indian embassy in beijing said.\n'in view of the large number of calls received in the two hotline numbers set up by @eoibeijing in connection with the outbreak of coronavirus infection, @eoibeijing has decided to open a third hotline number +8618610952903,' the embassy said in a tweet.\nthe other two hotline numbers are 8618612083629 and 8618612083617, the embassy said.\nthe embassy has also said it is 'examining all options' and holding consultations with china to provide relief to the indians holed up in wuhan.\n'over the last two days our hotlines have fielded nearly 600 calls to respond to concerns regarding this difficult situation. goi and @eoibeijing are also examining all options, including through consultations with the chinese authorities, to provide relief to our affected citizens,' another tweet by the embassy said.\nthe reference to 'all options' was seen as a pointer to explore the option to evacuate the stranded indians.\nthe pneumonia outbreak was first reported in wuhan city, central china's hubei province, in december 2019.\nthe city of 11 million has been in quarantine since thursday -- with nobody allowed to leave as the government tries to contain its spread.\nexperts have attributed the outbreak to a new strain of coronavirus that has since spread across china and abroad.\nabout 700 indian students are believed to have been enrolled into several universities in the city and surrounding areas.\nwuhan along 12 other cities have been completely sealed by the chinese authorities to stop the virus from spreading.\nwhile the majority of the indian students, mostly medical students reported to have left a few weeks ago to avail the chinese new year holidays, over 250 to 300 are still reportedly stayed put in the city causing concerns to them and their parents back home about their safety.\na number of indian phd students also studied in different universities in wuhan and the surrounding areas.\nsome students managed to leave before the city just before it was sealed off on january 23.\nmeanwhile, a chinese health official has said home quarantine is enough for the returning indian students from wuhan if they have not shown any symptoms but should be kept isolation in a hospital if they showed any signs of coronavirus.\n\"we have been advocating everyone home quarantine is enough if you do not have any symptoms, do well basic hygiene measures such as so go out wearing a mask, and reduce any party activity, drink plenty of water, and wash hands,\" gao fu, director general of china's centre for disease control and prevention, told media in beijing.\nasked about what would be the advice china would give to returning indian students from wuhan, he said: \"of course, if students returned to india found themselves to have obvious symptoms of the coronavirus, we should encourage them to go to the hospital, separate them from others swiftly.\"\n\"it's the most basic thing you can do to protect against infectious disease, no matter what it is,\" he said.\nin a rare move the indian embassy here on sunday cancelled the republic day ceremony, owing to the rising concern of the virus which has spread to all provinces except tibet.\nchina reported to have permitted the us to evacuate its diplomats and citizens from wuhan.\nthe united states has a consulate in wuhan. roughly 1,000 american citizens are thought to be in wuhan, a report in state-run china daily said.\nas the us plans to evacuate its citizens from wuhan, chinese foreign ministry said: \"following international customary practices, china makes arrangements that are consistent with our epidemic control measures and provides necessary assistance and convenience.\"\nreports say the us has already shut its consulate in wuhan and airlift the diplomats and some of the stranded americans to san francisco where they would be kept under observation.\nglobal times reported that france and south korea plans to airlift their citizens stranded in wuhan.

Currently, a woman who had been traveling as a tourist in China at the beginning of January was treated in the intensive care unit of the Bremen-Center hospital. Whether she actually infected with the virus is still unclear.\nMartin G\u00f6tz, Head of Unit for Infection Protection in the Health Office, confirms suspicion, but at the same time warns of an exaggerated fear of a plague. After her return from China, the woman had complained about symptoms similar to those of novel lung disease and is therefore reported in the emergency room of the hospital.\n\"The patient meets certain criteria,\" says G\u00f6tz, \"but it is not yet that in this case is actually the coronavirus.

The health department had already informed the Bremen Hospitals a week ago about the special protective measures according to the specifications of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) in Berlin, which intervenes in case of suspected cases. These include the strict isolation of the patients - this is best possible in the center of the Clinic in the intensive care unit, so the woman is there - as well as protective clothing for doctors and nursing staff.\n\"We try to keep the number of persons who come into contact with possible patients as low as possible,\" explains Rolf Schl\u00fcter, spokesman for the Health North Clinic Connector. The precautionary measures taken to prevent propagation from actual corona cases are high. This also confirms Michael Bojarra, boss hygiene at the Rotes Cross Hospital. The recommendations of the RKI and the World Health Organization would also be closely monitored and implemented there.\nIf there were cases of the disease in Bremen, according to G\u00f6tz, the patients would probably be treated in a larger insulated station in the Bremen-East Hospital or, depending on the individual state of health, laid directly into the Bernhard-Steint-Institut specialized on tropical and all novel diseases in Hamburg .

Other countries such as Japan, France and the US have already started such returnakers. Also, the Federal Government is also considered to be released from Germany from China. According to Foreign Minister Heiko Maas (SPD), a possible evacuation is considered. As the mirror reports, the Luftwaffe should fly to China on Wednesday or Thursday and fly out about 90 German citizens who had reported at the Foreign Office. However, the Chinese government is the mirror that civil machines and no military aircraft are used to avoid panic. According to a spokeswoman of the Foreign Office live in the Central Chinese Wuhan, the starting point of the epidemic, about 90 Germans. So far, there is no indications that one of them has infected with the new virus. Even in Germany itself, no introduced cases of the virus have been detected so far. However, some suspected cases are currently reviewed in Hesse, Bavaria and North Rhine-Westphalia. In the Frankfurt uni-clinic several people were investigated, a spokeswoman of the clinic participated in Monday. \"With any of these patients, the new coronavirus has been proven so far,\" she said. At the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities of the World Health Organization WHO reported an accumulation of pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause in the Central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the diseases. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days then a group released a group of the virologen Christian's premier from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 the first diagnostic test for the new virus, the researcher provisionally call 2019-NCOV. With the test, the virus can be detected in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, on which, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected. Both the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as well as Mers (MIDDLE East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses which have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more than 750 died. With the Mers virus since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, for example \n2,500 people infected, each third has died. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronaviruses. Many of them relate to respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example. In China, several thousand persons are suffering from them, some of them - most of them with pre-existing conditions - have died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first infection cases outside of China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been in Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection with a tourist, who came back from Wuhan, on January 24, the first cases were known in France. Meanwhile, first cases were confirmed in Germany. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. The virus can cause pneumonia that can endally end. Since it is a viral illness, antibiotics do not help. Meanwhile, it is clear that the virus can be transferred from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transfers after a dozen cases were known in medical staff. Medizors assume that the virus is transmitted above all over droplet infection. The World Health Organization calculates, as announced on January 24, at the moment that an infected one cuts 1.4 to 2.5 other people. Contest these numbers, the virus is less contagious than SARS and also the viral flu. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals. That can not be said yet. The World Health Organization said on 28 January that about one-fifth of the reported cases through the virus will be seriously ill, so in case of doubt must be treated intensive care. According to reports, the first death pots were patients who had some severe pre-existing conditions. Even with other infectious diseases, people with pre-existing diseases are particularly endangered - for example at the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so change their genome. This can cause you to become more dangerous for people in the course of an outbreak - but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) expects no similar mortality to the current time as the outbreak of SARS. To protect against the virus, some federal states have made supplementary security measures. As Hesse's social minister Kai Klose (Greens) announced, people who travel to China travel as well as travelers from the affected regions on the Frankfurt Airport. Also at the airports Berlin and Brandenburg are travelers with posters about the right behavior in disease symptoms \ninformed. During a suspicion during a flight or at the airport, affected persons would immediately be isolated and transported to a hospital. Pandemic and handling plans caused clarity, which in the case of cases at the airports and the clinics to do, Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU) said. \"Basically, we are alert, we take things very seriously, but we are well prepared,\" Spahn said. Meanwhile, Chinese state television reported to govern authorities that the number of confirmed infections has increased by more than 700 to 2,744 compared to the previous day, the number of dead around 24 to 80 - continues mostly older people with severe pre-existing conditions. Thus, the number of well-known diseases have been more than tenacity since last Monday, when around 220 cases were confirmed. With the approximately 50 cases outside of China, almost 2,800 cases are now confirmed worldwide. In Europe, three infections with the novel virus have been proven so far, all three concerned people in France, which were previously in China. The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) arrived in Beijing on Monday in order to inform himself about the situation. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus will meet government officials and other experts who are dealt with crisis management, it was said from the WHO office in Beijing. Foreign Minister Maas Riet Meanwhile from travel to China. \"Travelers should think about moving or refraining non-compelling trips to China,\" he said. The US and Canada also advise their citizens from travel to China. Already planned travel should be checked again. For the province of Hubei and the city of Wuhan, the US ministry explicitly warned of any travel. In the US, until Monday, there were five confirmed infections, Canada reported a first \"provisionally confirmed\" case. There are also dozens of evidence in countries such as Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore and Malaysia. The newly affected countries also include Cambodia. The new virus originally originated by a market in Wuhan, where it was probably overwhelmed by the wild animals traded on humans.

", "label": 1}, {"content": "coronavirus pandemic: how to limit economic fallout of virus outbreak. it is tough to avoid a global economic fallout when governments around the world are trying their best to contain raging novel coronavirus pandemic. more than 1,30,000 confirmed cases have been reported while the virus has claimed over 4,500 lives. in such a scenario, a government is almost entirely focused on ways to protect citizens. some hard decisions that are likely to have a long-term effect on the global economy have been taken by governments of affected nations in order to protect citizens. simply put, governments have had to pass orders stopping important economic activity including tourism, trade and manufacturing, production and much more. though it is not possible at the moment to calculate the total economic damage caused by covid-19, it will have significant economic fallout, many noted experts, including international monetary fund (imf) chief economist gita gopinath, have said. adapt, overcome gopinath recently wrote a blog where she mentioned that the world has suffered due to the virus, especially due to shocks in supply and demand stemming from the health crisis. she goes on to say that substantial targeted policies are needed to back the economy during the course of an epidemic. gopinath also explains that while businesses and firms around the globe cannot escape unharmed, they should be ready to double-up and recover once the outbreak fades. \"the goal is to prevent a temporary crisis from permanently harming people and firms through job losses and bankruptcies,\" she wrote. since there is no vaccine to contain the virus, countries have resorted to measures like travel restrictions, temporary school closures and quarantines. gopinath said such measures can work well during the crisis and put less economic pressure on the existing health systems. economic impact the financial impact of novel coronavirus pandemic, though cannot be determined by any single economic indicator, has been widespread. the financial distress caused to china, the worst affected country that is slowly recovering, has been the biggest blow to the world. several parts of china, which is considered the world's manufacturing hub, were put under strict restrictions when the outbreak was just identified. within a month, the death toll and the number of infected people shot up sharply. the chinese government was forced to lock down factories, prominent stores and other brands. it led to huge economic losses around the world and was reflected in stock markets around the globe, especially asian countries. many reports predicted that global gdp would take a massive hit as lockdown in china would lead to large-scale supply disruptions. \"the economic impact is already visible in the countries most affected by the outbreak. for example, in china, manufacturing and service sector activity declined dramatically in february. while the drop in manufacturing is comparable to the start of the global \nfinancial crisis, the decline in services appears larger this time-reflecting the large impact of social distancing,\" gopinath explained. in her blogpost, the imf chief economist warned about the financial effects and spillovers due to the covid-19 pandemic. there could be a rise in borrowing costs and financial conditions could also tighten. since most countries around the world will face economic shock at the same time, the economic impact of the virus could take a turn for the worse. how to limit fallout while it is not possible to completely avoid the economic fallout caused by the novel coronavirus outbreak, the imf chief economist said targeted economic policies will be needed to shore up economies after the outbreak fades. \"considering that the economic fallout reflects particularly acute shocks in specific sectors, policymakers will need to implement substantial targeted fiscal, monetary, and financial market measures to help affected households and businesses,\" gopinath opined. she goes on to say that households and businesses hit by supply disruptions could be \"targeted to receive cash transfers, wage subsidies, and tax relief\" to help them meet daily needs and sustain businesses. giving an example of crisis-hit italy, gopinath said the country has extended tax deadlines for companies in affected areas and broadened the wage supplementation fund to provide income support to workers who have been fired due to the virus outbreak. korea, meanwhile, has introduced wage subsidies for all small merchants and increased allowances for homecare and job seekers. china, for the time being, has waived social security contributions for businesses. gopinath said that central banks should also be ready to provide \"ample liquidity\" to banks and nbfcs, especially those who lend to small and medium-sized enterprises. such enterprises are usually not prepared to deal with a health crisis of such magnitude. \"governments could offer temporary and targeted credit guarantees for the near-term liquidity needs of these firms. for example, korea has expanded lending for business operations and loan guarantees for affected small- and medium-sized enterprises,\" she wrote \"financial market regulators and supervisors could also encourage, on a temporary and time-bound basis, extensions of loan maturities.\" gopinath also recommended broader monetary stimulus such as policy rate cuts or asset purchases, both of which can boost confidence and support financial markets. she, however, said these broad-based fiscal relief measures, should be effective when business operations begin to normalise.

(the opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for reuters.) by peter apps london, feb 28 (reuters) - as the coronavirus outbreak turns global, stock markets and world populations are waking up to the threat of a global pandemic. that, though, hasn\u2019t been the only disturbing global news this week. in the middle east and asia in particular, military tensions are on the rise \u2013 and major countries seem ever less bothered about taking off the gloves. most worrying, arguably, were events over the last 24 hours in syria. as that civil war enters its final throes, russia and turkey have been increasingly at loggerheads. the killing of 33 turkish soldiers in an apparent syrian government air strike on thursday took that confrontation into untested territory, with ankara now furious at not just moscow and damascus but also western nations it believes have abandoned it. on friday, turkey said it would no longer stop syrian refugees from making their way to europe, threatening a return of the mass population moves last seen in 2015-16. then, the arrival of hundreds of thousands in europe fuelled considerable popular discontent, powering the rise of right-wing parties. that comes against a backdrop of further confrontation between syria and israel, with israeli helicopters reportedly injuring several syrian personnel in attacks along the border. tensions and violence between iran and its regional enemies in the gulf are also arguably at an all-time high, even if the u.s. drone strike that killed iranian major general qassem soleimani does appear to have deterred direct regional escalation. in eastern ukraine, russian troops have been on the offensive again around the town of luhansk. and in the south china sea, this week saw chinese forces target a u.s. plane with what was described as a military laser, prompting angry complaints from washington. drawing a direct line between these confrontations and the virus outbreak is almost certainly a step too far, although the chinese government in particular might welcome a distraction from the outbreak. so might iran, already home to one of the largest outbreaks outside asia, and where popular discontent with the government has also been on the rise. what is more unarguably the case, however, is that the resources governments will need to plough into tackling the disease will likely prove a potent distraction from events elsewhere. what that will mean will be different in different places \u2013 and the long-term legacy may be distinctly different from the short-term consequences. in hong kong, worries over the virus seem to have dramatically reduced protests against the government in beijing. but they have also dramatically intensified anger and frustration with the mainland, which many hong kong residents see as mishandling the disease and exporting it to the city. if, as seems increasingly likely, the virus outbreak dramatically \ndents global economic growth, perhaps even producing a recession, that will likely raise the political temperature almost everywhere. much, of course, will depend on how serious the outbreak proves. particularly deadly outbreaks of disease have traditionally limited wars, at least their duration, decimating armies and leaving populations too weak to stomach serious conflict. already, an outbreak in south korea has prompted the united states to cancel planned military drills. whether coronavirus is truly enough to force nations towards an even temporary peace, however, may well be in doubt. what does look increasingly probable, is that it will affect millions and perhaps kill hundreds of thousands in multiple countries around the world. geopolitical confrontation invariably makes tackling such outbreaks harder, and the effect of conflict \u2013 and particularly mass population moves \u2013 can help their spread. most notable would be the spanish flu outbreak that swept the world following world war one. the death toll of that outbreak \u2013 believed to have affected up to a quarter of the global population - is estimated at between 40-100 million. if coronavirus does go global, it is still not impossible that will drive countries together rather than apart. at worst, though, it may simply further undermine the already deteriorating trust millions of people around the world have in their leaders and institutions to protect them. that\u2019s a recipe for further global instability, just as the world can afford it least. *** peter apps is a writer on international affairs, globalisation, conflict and other issues. he is the founder and executive director of the project for study of the 21st century;

representatives from more than 20 medical companies from their lunar new year celebrations to a conference room tucked inside seoul\u2019s busy train station.    one of the country\u2019s top infectious disease officials delivered an urgent message: south korea needed an effective test immediately to detect the novel coronavirus, then running rampant in china. he promised the companies swift regulatory approval.    though there were only four known cases in south korea at that point, \u201cwe were very nervous. we believed that it could develop into a pandemic,\u201d one attendee, lee sang-won, an infectious diseases expert at the korea centers for disease control and prevention, told reuters.    \u201cwe acted like an army,\u201d he said.    a week after the jan. 27 meeting, south korea's cdc approved one company\u2019s diagnostic test. another company soon followed. by the end of february, south korea was making headlines around the world for its drive-through screening centers and ability to test thousands of people daily.    south korea\u2019s swift action stands in stark contrast to what has transpired in the united states. seven weeks after the train station meeting, the koreans have tested well over 290,000 people and identified over 8,000 infections. new cases are falling off: ninety-three were reported wednesday, down from a daily peak of 909 two weeks earlier.    the united states, whose first case was detected the same day as south korea\u2019s, is not even close to meeting demand for testing. about 60,000 tests have been run by public and private labs in a country of 330 million, federal officials said tuesday.    as a result, u.s. officials don\u2019t fully grasp how many americans have been infected and where they are concentrated - crucial to containment efforts. while more than 7,000 u.s. cases had been identified as of wednesday, as many as 96 million people could be infected in coming months, and 480,000 could die, according to a projection prepared for the american hospital association by dr. james lawler, an infectious disease expert at the university of nebraska medical center.    \u201cyou cannot fight what you cannot see,\u201d said roger klein, a former laboratory medical director at the cleveland clinic and previously an adviser to the u.s. department of health and human services on clinical laboratory issues.    how the united states fell so far behind south korea, according to infectious disease experts, clinicians and state and local officials, is a tale of many contrasts in the two nations\u2019 public health systems: a streamlined bureaucracy versus a congested one, bold versus cautious leadership, and a sense of urgency versus a reliance on protocol.    the delayed and chaotic testing in the united states will cost lives, potentially including those of doctors and nurses, many medical experts predict. already more than 100 people have \ndied overall, and fears of rampant spread have led to extraordinary restrictions on social interaction, upending the u.s. economy, schools, hospitals and everyday life.    \"it makes me feel like i\u2019m living in a farce,\u201d said dr. ritu thamman, a cardiologist and clinical assistant professor at the university of pittsburgh school of medicine. even hospital staff who may have been exposed can\u2019t get a test, she said. \u201cwe are a rich country but we don\u2019t have these kinds of things?\u201d    the administration of president donald trump was tripped up by government rules and conventions, former officials and public health experts say. instead of drafting the private sector early on to develop tests, as south korea did, u.s. health officials relied, as is customary, on test kits prepared by the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention, some of which proved faulty. then, sticking to its time-consuming vetting procedures, the u.s. food and drug administration didn\u2019t approve tests other than the cdc\u2019s until feb. 29, more than five weeks after discussions with outside labs had begun.    meanwhile, in the absence of enough kits, the cdc insisted for weeks on narrow criteria for testing, recommending it only when a person had recently been to china or other hot spots or had contact with someone known to be infected. as a result, the federal government failed to screen an untold number of americans and missed opportunities to contain the spread, clinicians and public health experts say.    south korea took a risk, releasing briskly vetted tests, then circling back later to spot check their effectiveness. by contrast, the united states\u2019 fda said it wanted to ensure, upfront, that the tests were accurate before they went out to millions of americans.    \u201cthere are always opportunities to learn from situations like this one,\u201d fda commissioner stephen hahn, who has been on the job only three months, told reuters. \u201cbut one thing i will stand firm on: we cannot compromise on the quality of the tests because what would be worse than no tests at all is wildly inaccurate test results.\u201d    in a statement, cdc spokesman benjamin haynes said, \u201cthis process has not gone as smoothly as we would have liked.\u201d but he said \u201cmore and more state labs have come online, increasing our public health system\u2019s ability to detect and respond to cases.\u201d    bombarded by criticism amid a re-election campaign, trump vowed on friday to ramp up production of test kits in partnership with private companies and to make the diagnostic tests more widely available at hospitals and in-store parking lots. this week, the fda said more than 35 universities, hospitals and lab companies had begun running their own tests, under the agency\u2019s revised policy.    but it may be weeks before enough tests are on hand to fill the need.    \u201cthe idea of anybody getting (tested) easily the way people in other countries are doing it, we\u2019re not set up for that,\u201d anthony fauci, director of the national institute of \nallergy and infectious diseases told a house committee last week. \u201cthat is a failing. let\u2019s admit it.\u201d    it\u2019s a problem many americans, accustomed to hearing they have the most advanced medical care in the world, find hard to fathom.    \u201ci don\u2019t know how we messed this up so badly,\u201d said ruth blodgett, 65, whose husband of the same age couldn't get a coronavirus test on saturday in an urgent care clinic outside rochester, new york, even though he was coughing and the doctor ordered one for him. \u201dwe got caught flat-footed. for america, that\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d       \u2018hurry up and develop the kits\u2019    at the pivotal jan. 27 meeting at the seoul train station, south korean government leaders told companies they were cleared for takeoff.    \u201cthey were told that the \u2018emergency use authorization\u2019 would be coming, so hurry up and develop the kits,\u201d said lee hyukmin, head of the coronavirus task force at the korean society for laboratory medicine, who was at the meeting.    one of the companies was kogene biotech co ltd, whose test kit was the only one to work initially. the government announced its approval on feb. 4.    \u201cthe government acted quickly,\u201d said myoah baek, an executive director at kogene. the korean cdc \u201cdisclosed information on test methods so test kit makers were able to speed up development.\u201d    lee hyukmin of the korean laboratory society said the government was swift - but not reckless.    \u201cof course, a kit that\u2019s approved in one week isn\u2019t as good as one that goes through a year of clinical trials,\u201d he said. so in the early days, lee said, the government cross-checked cases to ensure the tests were working properly.    cross-checking involved verifying that labs got the same result the government did on an initial pool of patient samples. as of last week, nearly 100 labs were available to perform tests nationwide, according to government figures.    south korea\u2019s rapid response to the new coronavirus resulted from scars of the past.    in the aftermath of the 2015 outbreak of mers, short for the middle east respiratory syndrome, critics slammed then-president park geun-hye and her administration for a slow response and a lack of transparency. public confidence waned in park, who was impeached in 2017 following an unrelated corruption scandal.    the country had 186 mers cases, more than anywhere outside the middle east, including 38 deaths.    \u201cwe can't ever forget the incident. it is engraved in our mind,\u201d the korean cdc\u2019s lee sang-won said. \u201cwe were hurt so much, and we felt remorseful.\u201d       \u2018a real foul up\u2019    on jan. 31, only days after the seoul train station meeting, the u.s. department of health and human services (hhs) declared the novel coronavirus a public health emergency, citing a similar pronouncement from the world health organization.    hhs oversees the separate operations of the fda and cdc, key agencies involved in responding to the pandemic. the cdc was responsible for developing the initial test kits for the virus. \nthen, under longstanding protocols, the fda needed to approve the test before it could be sent to state and local labs around the country. private labs and large hospitals could develop their own tests or work off the cdc version.    on feb. 3, amid the preparations to address the emergency, the fda hosted an all-day conference at its headquarters in silver spring, maryland, which had been scheduled well before the outbreak. regulators, researchers and industry representatives gathered to discuss the general process for putting diagnostic tests cleared under emergencies on the path to permanent approval by the fda.    though coronavirus was now the hottest topic in global medicine, a broadcast of the meeting conveyed little sense of urgency about the epidemic sweeping the globe. it was mentioned in passing but regulators mostly stuck to their powerpoint presentations.    in his remarks, dr. timothy stenzel, who oversees the fda\u2019s review of diagnostic tests, spoke broadly about the agency\u2019s mission to protect public health: \u201cit's our goal to be first in the world wherever possible to authorize new tests.\u201d    carolyn hiller, a program director at the medical device innovation consortium, which hosted the event alongside fda, said there were discussions with the agency about postponing the meeting because of the coronavirus outbreak, but both sides opted to go ahead.    \"the whole coronavirus thing blew up in real time while this was happening,\u201d she said.    stenzel did not respond to a request for comment. in a statement, the fda acknowledged that the coronavirus was not a \u201cspecific topic on the agenda.\u201d but it said the agency already was talking to test developers and \u201cthe conference was timely and addressed issues important\u201d to firms and institutions looking to produce a test.    the following day, feb. 4, the fda greenlighted a cdc test kit for the virus.    weeks of chaos would follow.    by feb. 8, some states and other public labs were complaining that the cdc\u2019s test wasn\u2019t working because of a flawed component that gave inconclusive results. three days later, the cdc told the labs that it was manufacturing a new component.    as of mid-february, the federal government remained stuck in first gear. the cdc was the primary supplier of tests across much of the country, and other labs couldn\u2019t immediately deploy their own without the fda\u2019s blessing.    hhs said it has assigned a team of outside scientists to examine what went wrong with the cdc\u2019s initial batch of tests, such as whether there was a manufacturing defect, flawed design or contamination in the agency\u2019s lab. the precise problem has not been identified.    the cdc didn\u2019t send out new test kits until late february. meanwhile, public health experts say, a crucial window was closing on containing the virus, which by then was known to have infected more than 60 people.    the u.s. emergency declaration issued in late january created additional hurdles that hindered a wider expansion in \ntesting, according to former federal officials and lab professionals.    the declaration eased the way for drugmakers to pursue vaccines and antiviral treatments for covid-19. but public health experts said that the same declaration made it harder to expand diagnostic testing outside the cdc.    that\u2019s because the declaration required diagnostic tests developed by individual labs, such as those at hospitals or universities, to undergo greater scrutiny than in non-emergencies - presumably because the stakes are higher.    \"paradoxically, it increased regulations on diagnostics while it created an easier pathway for vaccines and antivirals,\" said dr. amesh adalja, a senior scholar at the johns hopkins university center for health security. \u201cthere was a real foul-up with diagnostic tests that has exposed a flaw in the united states' pandemic response plan.\u201d    dr. william schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at the vanderbilt university school of medicine, said the cdc and fda stuck to their conventional playbook for too long.    \u201ctraditional public health thinking is,\u2018don\u2019t create widespread panic and don\u2019t go over the top. keep the testing narrow in a precision rifle approach rather than a mass, shotgun approach,\u2019\u201d schaffner said. \u201cthat failed in this instance. this virus acted differently and it overwhelmed the u.s. system. south korea had a much better sense of what was happening.\u201d    in a statement tuesday, the cdc said: \u201cafter finding out that some labs could not fully verify the test, cdc began working on a solution and identifying the source of the problem \u2026. cdc, in conjunction with fda, determined how to move forward and shared this information immediately with public health labs.\u201d    the cdc statement also suggested that the agency was not exclusively responsible for testing delays.    the cdc was \u201cnot an impediment\u201d to getting large-scale commercial testing started, according to the statement. that was the role of the fda, and as the initial u.s. cases were being detected in late january and early february, cdc director dr. robert redfield highlighted the need for that agency to act, according to the cdc statement.    alberto gutierrez, who led the fda\u2019s office overseeing diagnostic testing from 2009 to 2017, said the agency proceeded with caution because it saw itself as the last line of defense against opportunistic companies looking to cash in on threats to public health. \u201cthere is money to be made in an emergency, and a lot of people try to take advantage of that,\u201d gutierrez said. \"the problem the fda faces is, do you let it become the wild west?\u201d    \u201cthe fda had good intentions,\u201d he said.       ramping up    as u.s. efforts faltered, south korean officials cleared a test from a second company, seegene inc, on feb. 12.    with many more tests in hand, health officials were well armed to attack a fast-moving virus and aggressively track down people who may have been exposed. this testing-backed \noffensive helped south korea reduce the number of new cases over a matter of weeks, serving as a model for other countries grappling with the pandemic.    in mid-february, cases spiked at a secretive church in the southeastern city of daegu. on feb. 26, daegu city officials said they would test every single member of the church, including those without symptoms.    as of march 10, daegu said that it had tested almost all of the 10,000 members of the church in that area, and about 40% came back positive. the city, which now accounts for about three-quarters of total infections in south korea, has seen new cases sharply drop. on wednesday, officials announced 46 new cases compared to a peak of 741 cases on feb. 29.    the country went from two approved test makers on feb. 18 to five as of last week, according to the korean cdc.    \u201cto my surprise, test kit makers were able to boost production quickly,\u201d korean cdc\u2019s lee sang-won said.       pleading with washington    by feb. 24, state and local labs in the united states were pleading with the fda to relax its rules so the nation no longer had to rely so heavily on the cdc for testing. they asked hahn, the fda commissioner, for \u201cenforcement discretion\u201d so they could use their own lab-developed tests.    \u201cwe are now many weeks into the response with still no diagnostic or surveillance test available outside of cdc for the vast majority of our member laboratories,\u201d scott becker, chief executive of the association of public health laboratories, and grace kubin, lab services director at the texas department of state health services, wrote to hahn on feb. 24 in a letter reviewed by reuters.    in an interview, becker, whose group represents more than 100 state and local health laboratories, called the letter a \u201chail mary\u201d pass, an act of desperation.    \u201cthe entire lab community was really coming unglued. we knew we could develop tests and were very capable of doing that, but we felt hamstrung\u201d becker told reuters.    he said labs wanted fda to make more tests available so they could run more patient samples at a faster pace.    two days after receiving becker\u2019s letter, the fda commissioner said his agency was ready to approve new outside tests quickly - if its requirements for accuracy were satisfied.    \u201cfalse diagnostic test results can lead to significant adverse public health consequences,\u201d hahn wrote to the association of public health laboratories in a feb. 26 letter, \u201cnot only serious implications for individual patient care but also serious implications for the analyses of disease progression and for public health decision-making.\u201d    under increasing pressure, the fda relented and removed many of the bureaucratic obstacles. on feb. 29, the agency said public and private labs, including academic medical centers, could start using their own tests before the fda had completed its full review. laboratories had 15 business days to submit a completed application, which could be approved \nretroactively.    that same day, the trump administration confirmed the first death in the united states from the coronavirus, a man in his 50s in washington state.    on march 2, stenzel at the fda\u2019s diagnostic testing office hosted a webinar for lab test developers, highlighting additional challenges, including a shortage of viral samples needed for validation of test results. some labs also have reported shortages of other key supplies and ingredients, as well as the need for more trained personnel.    as u.s. regulators rewrote their policies, south korean municipalities were opening roadside testing facilities across the country, collecting samples in minutes while people sat in their cars.    at a closed-door meeting last week in congress, u.s. representative raul ruiz, a democrat from california and an emergency-room physician who treated patients during the 2009 h1n1 influenza outbreak, pressed the fda commissioner and other members of the trump administration on why south korea was lapping the united states in its response.    \u201cwhy don\u2019t we have drive-through testing like south korea?\u201d ruiz asked leaders of the president\u2019s coronavirus task force.    ruiz told reuters the officials said they were working on it. on their own, some hospitals and communities have begun offering drive-through testing in colorado, new york, texas and elsewhere.    in recent days, as the public criticism grew louder, trump appointed a testing czar to improve coordination across agencies. the fda launched a 24-hour hotline for laboratories needing help to accelerate testing, approved two company applications for higher-volume testing and granted states the flexibility to authorize new tests so labs can bypass the fda.    despite the new moves, ruiz said he fears america is still weeks away from approaching what south korea has accomplished. \u201ci think months have been lost here,\u201d ruiz said. \u201cmaybe we should look into purchasing south korea\u2019s tests.\u201d    that may happen. both kogene and solgent co, two of the covid-19 test-makers approved in south korea, said their companies have an eye on the u.s. market.    \u201cthe fda asked us to proceed with applications quickly,\u201d kogene executive myoah baek said. reuters ", "label": 1}, {"content": "coronavirus not as deadly

In the People's Republic, the number of diseases increased by 1459 within one day until Wednesday. This gas more than 6000 cases. Another 26 patients died in China. Thus, the total number of deaths climbed to 132. While there is slightly more than 80 proven infections outside the People's Republic, the Health Commission in Beijing counted around 5951 patients in China until Wednesday. There are nearly 10 000 suspicions. The Commission reported even 5974 cases, but reclaimed 23 infections in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao. Beijing considers these territories as part of the People's Republic. Of the patients, 1239 are difficult to ill. The deaths are usually older patients with pre-existing conditions. Among other things, outside the People's Republic, there are also in Thailand, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, the USA, Australia or South Korea with the new virus. In Europe, four cases were also confirmed in France. Most of the patients were previously in China. However, there are increasingly infections that have happened outside in contact with travelers from China - as well as in Japan and Taiwan. Thus, the government in Beijing advised his citizens to postpone travel abroad for the time being. In China, the ELF million metropolis of Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province in Central China are particularly affected. Around 45 million people were largely sealed there. Flights and near and long-distance traffic were exposed. Japan began to retrieve first compatriots from the area. A charter machine with 206 people from Wuhan landed on Wednesday in Tokyo. The occupants did not use the normal flight terminal for regular passengers, but were brought into a medical institution in a special bus. Further flights should follow because about 650 Japanese want to go back. Germany and other countries such as the US, South Korea or India are also considering or planning similar return campaigns. There are around 90 Germans in Wuhan. How many of them want to fly out to Germany is unclear. Australia also wants to fly citizens from the crisis region, but stuck in a quarantine zone on the Christmas island for 14 days.

Until then, employees of the company headquarters should not travel to national and international locations, as the company announced on Tuesday night. Webasto is a large supplier for the automotive industry with a total of 13 400 employees at 50 locations worldwide. In China, there are twelve locations, one of them in Wuhan. The infected Chinesein, which had come to the seminar of the company, had infected himself to her parents in the city. Symptoms developed them until the return flight to China on January 23. In the fight against the virus, new reporting obligations in Germany come to airlines and hospitals, as Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU) announced. For example, when flights from China, pilots should inform the tower about the health of the passengers before landing. Travelers from China are intended to provide information on their flight, whereabouts and accessibility in forms in the next 30 days. Clinics should in future also have to report justified suspected cases on the coronavirus to the Robert Koch Institute - not only confirmed cases.

He go well. \"He is fever-free, currently has no respiratory symptoms more.\" The incubation period is up to two weeks in pulmonary disease. However, infected are already contagious, even before they show symptoms, which makes the containment of the virus more difficult. The new 2019 NCOV virus originally comes from a market in Wuhan, where it was probably overwhelmed by wild animals on humans. The symptoms - including dry cough, fever and respiratory distress - can be mitigated with drugs. According to the current assessment of experts, pulmonary disease is apparently in most cases mild, partly even without symptoms. The new pathogen is very similar to the virus behind the SARS pandemic 2002/2003 also broken out in China. At that time, 8,000 people were ill. Nearly 800 died.
