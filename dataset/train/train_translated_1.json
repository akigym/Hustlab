It is less deadly than the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), but more communicable, this Sunday said the director of the Chinese control and disease prevention center. With the experts still trying to better realize the epidemic that emerged in Wuhan, they begin to get a few more aspects of the 2019-NCOV. The exact source of the virus, which host (animal) and whether or not there was an intermediate host are still unanswered questions. Coronaviruses belong to a virus family that, in most cases, circulate between animals, such as birds, bats and small mammals. In the human being they normally cause respiratory diseases, ranging from simple colds to pneumonias. So far, only coranaviruses associated with SARS - serious acute respiratory syndrome (the 2019-NCOV is 88% genetically equal) and the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East had the capacity to cross the barrier of species, transmitting to humans. The first cases of the current epidemic appeared in mid-December in Wuhan, when hospitals began to receive people with a mysterious viral pneumonia. All of them worked or regularly attended the market for seafood and meat of the city, however closed, so it is believed that at the origin of the disease they will have been infected animals, marketed alive. The main suspicion is that (such as Mers and SARS) Coronavirus has arisen in bats, although it is necessary another host to reach humans. According to a study published in the Journal of Medical Virology, two Chinese snakes may have had this role: MulticinCTUS Bungarus and Naja Atra, both sold in the Wuhan market. It's a hypothesis, since scientifically nothing is proven. They are more intense than a flu. Include high fever, difficulty breathing and pulmonary lesions. It is thought that the incubation period is two weeks. Initially it was thought that \nHe could only pass animals to humans, but quickly the Chinese authorities confirmed that the virus is transmissible among humans, after several professionals from a hospital have been infected after dealing with a patient.

By customers understand the marks, many of them multinationals, who need the products to put them on the market. And the cause of this panic is the outbreak of the new coronavirus, which paralyzed a large part of China and now reaches the north of Italy. C\u00e9sar Ara\u00fajo is also chairman of the Board of Directors of Calvelex, a company in the sector that has much of its production dedicated to marks addressed to the luxury market. Calvelex suspended part of production last week, as usual at the time, underlines the administrator, but seeking to gain breath and save raw materials - some are already scarce - for a period of more orders. \"For example, silk comes from Asia and China. How much you want, I will not find a supplier you can supply this, \"he explains. And the decrease in orders is also a problem: \"In this sector, for some customers the Chinese market is the first and for others is the second. With these measures to collect mandatory, people do not consume either. It is possible to suspend production because some factories depend on these supplies. \" The President of ANIVEC is advancing that there are talks with ministries of labor and economy, as well as with the Secretary of State for Internationalization (which depends on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs), to find ways to find solutions and \"anticipate problems in the supply\". C\u00e9sar Ara\u00fajo points to the fact that several airlines have stopped flying to China and the inspections in the ports are time-consuming as two factors of difficulty in the regularization of the situation. and alert: the stocks of \nSector companies raw materials last, at best, a \"six weeks\", so it is concerned already production for the next few weeks. The outbreak of Covid-19 reached two nevalgic regions not only for this sector, but also for clothing and footwear. \"China produces more than 20% of transactable goods in the world, anything thus has a global impact. Italy is also a major producer of raw materials and brands, \"says Micam, Mipele and Lineapelle: Thus the three fairs are called the footwear that took place last week in Milan, Italy, and where there were about 400 Portuguese , representing more than 100 companies in the sector, confirmed the Expresso Paulo Gon\u00e7alves, Director of Communication from APICCAPS, the Portuguese Association of Footwear Industrialists, Components, Skin Articles and Succeeding.

At Malpensa airport, he had verified the temperature of those who arrived and more instructions were given, but there was still no widespread concern this Monday. They are not common measures, but they did not cause great disorder to visitors to the events. - The difference was inside the fairs, where less \"20% of travelers\" and much less Asians were registered. \"Risking me to say that there was no there,\" says Paulo Gon\u00e7alves. Therefore, although everything has elapsed in a climate of \"normality\", there is some apprehension in the Portuguese footwear industry: \"For a sector that exports 98% of production to virtually everyone, this is always a sign of any concern.

In this case, the fear is that there is a lack of raw materials and components - namely \"synthetic yarns, some labels, plastic accessories, latches\" - a situation that has not yet been found among ATP members. \"The information we have is that production in China is being resumed only with local staff, some of them are about 30% of their ability. Hopefully normalize, \"he adds. If the Portuguese textiles manage to maintain their normal laboration, Mario Jorge Machado takes advantage that some orders for units in China can be made in Portugal \"I felt in the last few days, namely in Modtissimo [Textile Salon that took place this Wednesday and Thursday , at Porto airport], which buyers of several Portuguese brands made more orders to avoid being exposed to more issues of geosa\u00fade and geopolitics.

On the other hand, footwear works in Portugal as a \"cluster\", where there are several companies for various types of components, ensuring production continuity. As for the markets here, they are also not the first order: the footwear industry exports to Italy about 40 million euros and a little less for China and Hong Kong (30 million). In order to perceive the proportion, exports to France reach EUR 400 million and the US at 100 million euros.

such as funding and drug development across the public health and scientific community, but without causing unnecessary public alarm.    who director general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus has publicly signalled support for a more nuanced approach, saying the current system of declaring a public health emergency is too blunt.    \"it's either red or green,\" tedros said during a jan. 29 conference with news media. \"i think we have to now revise that. you cannot have just yes or no. there could be some intermediate situation.\" he suggested a yellow stage that could be \u201ca warning\u2026serious enough but not really red.\u201d    the agency\u2019s emergency committee on the new coronavirus, which is made up of independent experts, alluded to the internal discussions the

creating an intermediate level of alert\u201d between pheic or no pheic.    who spokeswoman margaret \nharris said that currently the decision on declaring a public health emergency of international concern, or pheic, is \u201cbinary.\u201d she said the who\u2019s emergency committee on coronavirus suggested, and the director general agreed, to meet to \u201creview whether the existing instrument is still fit for purpose.\u201d    the discussion around the agency\u2019s messaging on epidemics comes as it seeks to coordinate the global fight against an outbreak of infection with the newly identified coronavirus, which emerged in december. now known as covid-19, it has spread from china to more than 100 countries, killing thousands of people with more expected to die.    while many public health experts say the who\u2019s response to this epidemic has been timely and decisive, the agency has also drawn criticism from some commentators who say it has been too quick to heap praise on china \u2013 a criticism tedros has strongly rejected, saying china\u2019s drastic measures have slowed the virus spread and allowed other countries to prepare. the agency also came under intense media scrutiny in recent weeks as it refrained from calling the infectious disease\u2019s spread a pandemic, even as it took grip in scores of countries around the world.    when the who did on wednesday describe covid-19 as a pandemic, director general tedros said the agency was concerned about \u201cthe alarming levels of spread and severity\u201d of coronavirus. while the characterisation doesn\u2019t trigger any formal change in what the agency does or it recommends countries do, some public health experts said it might prompt governments to move more swiftly to make interventions, such as banning or restricting public gatherings or travel.       global health emergency    under the who\u2019s international health regulations, the agency can formally declare a pheic (pronounced \"fake\"), or global health emergency, which it did with covid-19 on jan. 30. such declarations are made when an epidemic meets two criteria: the outbreak poses a risk to more than one \ncountry and it requires a coordinated international response. the formal designation triggers various moves, including calls for increased funding and resources, recommendations to countries aimed at preventing or reducing cross-border spread of disease and boosting public health measures.    the who has declared pheics on five previous occasions, including the west africa ebola outbreak starting in 2014 and the 2016 zika virus outbreak that spread from brazil.    in 2009, the who declared the outbreak of h1n1 flu a pandemic. that move later drew criticism from some governments that it triggered some countries to take expensive measures, including stockpiling and prescribing anti-viral drugs and undertaking mass vaccinations against a flu that ultimately turn out to be milder than originally thought. the then-director general, dr. margaret chan, has defended her decision as the \u201cright call.\u201d    how the who communicates around global epidemics was under review even before the covid-19 outbreak began in december, according to the two people familiar with the discussions.    according to one of those people, the discussion was prompted in part by last year\u2019s outbreak of ebola in eastern democratic republic of congo, which the who declared a pheic in july 2019. who officials wanted to sound an alarm and prompt a global response in terms of funding and vaccines, but there were questions among some officials at the who and member states about whether it was truly an international issue because the ebola outbreak affected only congo and neighbouring uganda, the person said. they added that these questions focused discussion on whether a graded approach might be more appropriate.    when covid-19 began spreading beyond china, global health officials and experts looked to the who to declare a pheic. even after it did so in late january, the agency faced repeated questions from international media on whether or not the outbreak was a pandemic.       pandemic control    some \nwho chiefs have expressed concern that using the label pandemic might signal to governments and the public that the coronavirus outbreak had developed to a level where there was no longer action they could take to control its spread.    that was a key part of the who\u2019s message when it did ultimately call the coronavirus as a pandemic. \u201cwe cannot say this loudly enough, or clearly enough, or often enough: all countries can still change the course of this pandemic. this is the first pandemic that can be controlled,\u201d tedros said in a tweet wednesday.    who officials and some global health experts said the media\u2019s focus on the word pandemic was an unwanted distraction for them because, unlike the pheic classification, it doesn\u2019t trigger specific responses within countries.    \"there is an unhelpful alignment in people's minds between this 'pandemic' word and some sort of major shift in approach - but this is not the case,\" mike ryan, head of who's health emergencies programme, told reporters at a march 3 briefing for news media.    a sign of the who\u2019s frustration was visible during a news conference this week \u2013 one of around 30 hour-long briefings the who has held for international media since the covid-19 outbreak began. a senior official who had been asked repeatedly by journalists about whether the disease constituted a pandemic gave a half-joking but tetchy response: \"this is a word you love, right? you just can't wait, can you?\"    some specialists agree that the external focus on the label pandemic have been a distraction, including lawrence gostin, a global health expert at georgetown university law school in washington. gostin has been openly critical of the who in the past - in particular for what he considered to be moving too slowly to declare international emergencies over ebola and zika. with the covid-19 outbreak, however, gostin said the who was right to not describe it as a pandemic prematurely because the word tends to generate fear.    global health \nspecialists say that more subtleties in how who messages around epidemics could be useful, but say they doubt it will make much practical difference.    \"in the end if you move from a binary to a three or four stage process, you'll always have these semantic arguments,\" said jeremy farrar, an expert in infectious disease

", "label": 1}, {"content": "Does the coronavirus spread now in Germany? After the disclosure of new infection detections with the Coronavirus SARS-COV-2, hope has been fell to keep the lung disease from Germany. What is done to narrow the spread and what is known about the virus and the disease? What is the risk of another spread in Germany? According to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), a further import of cases to Germany must be expected. Other transfers of SARS COV-2, infection chains and outbreaks in the country are possible. Local infections could initially remain unrecognized, said Vice President of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), Lars Schaade, in the RBB. It is \"quite possible that we do not recognize all these outbreaks immediately\". It is necessary to expect that thereby coming to another spread. The risk to the health of the population in Germany currently appreciate the experts as low to moderate. What would a greater outbreak in Germany mean for the health system? An infection wave in this country could include full waiting areas and medical practices, intensive care beds and fully overloaded health insurance offices, the Berlin virologist Christian had recently explained. As a problem, experts see that the annual influenza wave is currently rolling through Germany - and the health system already stressed heavily. For this reason, it is the goal of delaying the spread of the coronavirus as far as possible as the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) recently explained. \"We have to try adequate effort to slow the spread to mitigate an intense stress pillar on the health system,\" said Road. \"The number of infections should be extended over a long time as possible.\" How contagious is the new coronavirus? a value, how many other people an infected \nIncludes on average, can still not be saved. The virus spreads by droplet infection for about coughing and talking. First results indicate that the virus can also be distributed over the digestive system and at least a few days over surfaces. An underestimated risk was possibly that in stool samples of patients in the initial phase of Covid-19-disease \"quite relevant quantities\" of SARS-COV-2 were detectable, about Clemens Wendtner, chief physician of infectious and tropical medicine at Munich Klinik Schwabing had , explained. How dangerous is the virus? That's still a difficult question. For a final assessment of the severity of the new respiratory disease, there are currently not enough data, says something the RKI. According to a recent analysis of Chinese's Health Authority, 2.3 percent die in the country infected with SARS COV-2. Above all, old people and those with severe pre-conditions such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes are concerned. For people over the age of 80, the death rate calculated from the data available there is almost 15 percent, so in this age group in China dies about 15 out of 100 infected in China. In the group of 10 to 39 years old people die 0.2 percent of the infected, ie about 2 out of 1,000 concerned. Experts assume that mortality is actually less than calculated in China, among other things, because in Chinese statistics many mild extensive infections are not collected at all. But secured analyzes for mortality from other countries do not exist so far. Which symptoms causes the new coronavirus? Most people have only a slight cold symptom with freasting and sore throat or no symptoms. Fever, cough and respiratory problems, as they also occur with a flu. Also headache or diarrhea are \npossible. According to the Chinese Health Authority, it comes with more than 80 percent of the infected to mild infection processes, almost 14 percent of suffering difficulty. At almost five percent, life-threatening effects such as respiratory arrest, septic shock or multi-organ failure. The incubation time - the period between infection and start of symptoms - is usually 2 to 14 days after the current level. This is the reason that suspected cases are isolated two weeks. How can the new lung disease be treated? There is no special therapy for the COVID-19 disease. Heavy-patients are treated symptomatically: with fever-lowering agents, the therapy of any bacterial additional infections and sometimes mechanical ventilation. In individual cases, antiviral drugs are also tested. Is there a protective vaccine? no. Several laboratories worldwide are currently researching vaccines as they are available for the flu. The development of a vaccine takes a lot of time. WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan believes that first vaccine testing could start people in three to four months. A certified vaccine for far-reaching use is probably only available in 18 months. The US biotech company Moderna had reported on Monday, developed a vaccine candidate and delivered to the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NiaID). Its director Anthony Fauci announced according to CNN's first clinical trials for the end of April. He, too, expected it to take one to one and a half years before a vaccine is available. How else can I protect myself from infectance? To protect against this as well as other viruses, experts recommend ordinary hygiene measures: regular hand washing, disinfectant and distance to suffice. the benefits of normal breathing masks - as currently in China and others \nLands to see on the streets everywhere - appreciate experts as rather low. It can help to restrict hugs and shaking hands and suggested by many people, such as door tinkers, handles and elevator buttons do not touch. Can I infect myself if I get a package from China or other risk regions? Basically, it is unclear how long the virus survives on surfaces, the World Health Organization WHO says. Studies suggested that there are a few hours or days - depending on conditions such as surface, temperature or moisture. The likelihood that an infected goods contaminated with the virus is classified by the authority as low. The risk that a recipient is indicated by a packet exposed on the transport of different conditions and temperatures is low. Imported foods and goods such as toys, computers or clothes are also unlikely as infection sources, says the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment. Experts emphasize how important it is to observe general hygiene rules, so about washing their hands regularly. What do I do if I'm afraid of being infected? If you had contact to an infected, according to RKI, you should first report to his health department, regardless of whether symptoms have occurred or not. Travelers from risk areas that have symptoms should consult a doctor after telephone reservation with reference to the journey. What may the state in an emergency? The essential regulates the nationwide valid Infection Protection Act (IFSG). A spokesman for the Bavarian Ministry of Health summarizes: \"If necessary, important fundamental rights such as freedom of the person, freedom of assembly or inviolability of the apartment and the right to physical integrity can be restricted.\" Authorities may, according to the Bayreuth State Legal Law Stephan Rixen and \nCook the smears of skin and mucous membranes. Even \"disease suspects\" and \"infectual suspect\" - as the law expresses it - could be imposed on a professional ban. To protect others, people could also \"be separated in a suitable hospital or otherwise suitably\", it says in the law.

(march 18) advised singaporeans to defer all travel abroad with immediate effect, superseding an earlier travel advisory announced just three days ago to defer all non-essential travel abroad.   the expansion of the advisory is to reduce the risk of singaporeans being infected with the virus when they are overseas, and then spreading it to other singaporeans when they return, the health ministry (moh) said in a press release on wednesday.   from 11.59pm on friday, all singaporeans, permanent residents, long-term pass holders and short-term visitors entering singapore will also be issued with a 14-day stay-home notice.   short-term visitors subjected to this notice have to provide proof of the place where they will be staying in for isolation.   the extra measures for all travellers entering the country is aimed at reducing the risk of further importation leading to community spread in singapore, it added.      the latest expansion of travel restrictions come as singapore confirmed 47 new covid-19 cases on wednesday\u2014 the highest single-day jump by a wide margin.   out of the new cases, 33 of them were imported, and 30 of them are singapore residents who have returned from abroad, health minister gan kim yong said at a press briefing by the multi-ministry covid-19 taskforce.   over the past three days, almost 70 per cent of singapore\u2019s new covid-19 cases were imported, most of whom were singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning here after they had travelled overseas.   national development minister lawrence wong, who also co-chaired the briefing, said that the government expects the number of imported cases to go up as more singaporeans return home.\u00a0   \u201clike how we flew the chartered flight back from wuhan, a number of singaporeans on those flights were infected and that was one city (in china). \nnow we have many cities all over the world in europe where it is circulating quite quickly,\u201d he said.\u00a0   the recent imported cases are singapore residents who came back one or two weeks ago, mr wong said.\u00a0   he also said that the government has decided to get people here to defer all

this new travel restriction, whereby students who have travelled with their family overseas during this period will be asked to stay at home for 14 days, even if they return before the friday deadline.\u00a0   employers to get approval for work pass holders   as for new and existing work pass holders returning to singapore, the ministry of manpower (mom) said in a statement on wednesday that those entering singapore from 11.59pm this friday will need to obtain mom\u2019s approval before they begin their journey back.   this applies to existing work pass holders and those who have received in-principle approval for their passes and have yet to enter singapore.   employers of these work pass holders must apply for the entry approval on mom\u2019s website.   they must declare to the ministry that they have arranged for suitable accommodation for these employees during the 14-day stay-home notice.   \u201cemployers should inform their affected employees (including their dependants) not to make travel \nplans to singapore until approval has been received from mom,\u201d the ministry said.   they will have to send mom\u2019s approval letter to the employees, who will need to show it to the airline crew upon check-in and at the border checkpoints when they arrive in singapore.   spread of virus gaining pace   moh said that there has been a sharp increase in the number of covid-19 cases globally, and the spread is gaining pace across the world.   to date, there are close to 200,000 confirmed cases across 159 countries, with more than 7,900 deaths.   \u201cmany countries have seen an exponential rise in cases recently, and more than 40,000 new cases have been reported in the past three days.   \u201cglobally the number of cases and deaths has surpassed those in china since the beginning of the outbreak,\u201d moh stated.   previously announced measures to ban short-term visitors with recent travel history to mainland china, france, germany, iran, italy, south korea and spain from entering singapore remain in effect.   those who are on stay-home notices would have to remain in their place of residence at all times for 14 days after entering singapore.   this new travel restriction will also apply to those entering singapore via the land checkpoints from malaysia, mr wong said.   \u201cbut for people like truck drivers or others who move between singapore and malaysia every day, separate arrangements will have to be worked out by both countries. it doesn\u2019t make sense to put this group under stay-home notice,\u201d

Both people had not showing any signs of infection when they arrived in Germany, said Health Minister Jens Spahn: \"Both at departure in China as well as on arrival in Frankfurt were these two patients symptom-free.\" They would now be investigated in the Frankfurt Uniklinik. According to the medical director J\u00fcrgen Graf, the two patients are \"medically well\". The 124 returnees and returnees had landed on Saturday on board a Bundeswehr machine at Frankfurt Airport and were initially brought to a medical center in a rebuilt gym. There they were interviewed and examined. After that, eleven people were brought directly to the hospital. With one of them, the suspicion of a coronavirus infection, but not confirmed this. The other patients were brought to the clinic because of other medical problems. The remaining returns must spend the next two weeks in quarantine in the South Palatia barracks. The authorities said the danger to the population was low. Nine Germans had infected with the virus before the two new cases. In Bavaria, the Ministry of Health reported an eighth illness on Saturday, while Spain announced, a German tourist has become infected with the Coronavirus. The coronavirus has an incubation time of up to two weeks, in which no symptoms yet \nappear. Nevertheless, an infection may be available. At the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities of the World Health Organization WHO reported an accumulation of pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause in the Central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the diseases. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days then a group released a group of the virologen Christian's premier from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 the first diagnostic test for the new virus, the researcher provisionally call 2019-NCOV. With the test, the virus can be detected in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, on which, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected. Both the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as well as Mers (MIDDLE East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses which have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more than 750 died. With the MERS virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronaviruses. Many of them relate to respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example. In China, several thousand persons are suffering from them, some of them - most of them with pre-existing conditions - have died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first infection cases outside of China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been in Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection with a tourist, who came back from Wuhan, on January 24, the first cases were known in France. Meanwhile, too \nFirst cases in Germany confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. The virus can cause pneumonia that can endally end. Since it is a viral illness, antibiotics do not help. Meanwhile, it is clear that the virus can be transferred from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transfers after a dozen cases were known in medical staff. Medizors assume that the virus is transmitted above all over droplet infection. The World Health Organization calculates, as announced on January 24, at the moment that an infected one cuts 1.4 to 2.5 other people. Contest these numbers, the virus is less contagious than SARS and also the viral flu. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals. That can not be said yet. The World Health Organization said on 28 January that about one-fifth of the reported cases through the virus will be seriously ill, so in case of doubt must be treated intensive care. According to reports, the first death pots were patients who had some severe pre-existing conditions. Even with other infectious diseases, people with pre-existing diseases are particularly endangered - for example at the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so change their genome. This can cause you to become more dangerous for people in the course of an outbreak - but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) expects no similar mortality to the current time as the outbreak of SARS. In China, the country of origin of the virus, the epidemic continues to spread. The country experienced the highest increase in infections on Saturday \nAnd deaths within a day. The health commission in Beijing reported nearly 2,000 new ill and 45 deaths. Thus, in China, a total of 304 people died at the respiratory disease, more than 14,000 people have become infected. Meanwhile, there was also a first death outside of China, in the Philippines. From Wuhan, the virus has spread in 24 other countries. More and more countries, including Germany and France, fly citizens from the infection area. According to the knowledge of Chinese researchers, the Coronavirus can spreader not only about droplets, but also about the digestive system. The physicians have found the virus in stool samples and rectal strokes after they had found that some patients had received only diarrhea instead of fever. Research involved the University of Wuhan and the Virus Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in the provincial capital of Hubei. While more and more people infect, there are also good news: Scientists of the Institute of Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani in Rome has succeeded in isolating the coronavirus. \"This is an important news internationally,\" said Italian Minister of Health Roberto Speranza. \"It means that there are more opportunities to understand and study the virus to curb it.\" The results would be provided by the international community for further research. At the special institute, investigations will be carried out in the case of Corona suspicion in Italy. In Italy, there are two confirmed cases of Chinese tourists who are infected with the virus from their homeland.

tested.       delayed response    china last week locked down the affected region in hubei province in the biggest quarantine operation on record and is building two new hospitals to treat virus patients. president xi jinping has created a special committee to \ntackle the outbreak.    the country has been praised internationally for quickly sequencing the virus gene. however, its slow scale-up of testing has been questioned.    once a virus has been identified, \"you need to make sure you have all the reagent (a substance used in chemical analysis) samples and you\u2019ve got it all pushed out to where you want to do testing,\" said amesh adalja, a senior scholar at the johns hopkins university center for health security, who focuses on emerging infectious disease and pandemic preparedness.    although information from the region is scarce, adalja suggested china has had problems with this stage of tackling the outbreak. \"we\u2019re already hearing that there are shortages of medical professionals there, that there are shortages of test kits and medicines,\" he said.    john edmunds, a professor at the centre for mathematical modelling of infectious diseases at the london school of hygiene & tropical medicine, said china has not communicated enough detailed data after the initial outbreak.    \"we have a very incomplete picture of what\u2019s going on,\" he told reuters. \"whether it\u2019s incompetence, secrecy, or deliberate, i don\u2019t know, but it would be very useful if we could have some basic epidemiological data.\"    the shortage of testing supplies and china's initial reticence have drawn criticism that the country is still learning lessons from the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) in 2002 that killed almost 800 people.    \"the improvements have been on the hard science side - figuring out the virus's genome, building new hospitals at a moment's notice - more than on the soft science side of managing information and dealing with people,\" said mary gallagher, a political science professor who leads the university of michigan's center for chinese studies.    city managers had little incentive to escalate problems to political superiors. the week in which no new virus cases were reported in hubei coincided with preparations \nfor the lunar new year and sessions of the province's national people's congress and the chinese people's political consultative conference.       still waiting    seven of the largest hospitals in wuhan are now equipped with testing kits for the virus, which in theory deliver results within a day, the hubei cdc official said.    but four people told reuters they were refused tests because the process involved a complex reporting system including hospital, district and city health authorities and disease control officials.    to qualify for the test, patients need to meet certain criteria, such as having symptoms of fever and pneumonia, and a surge in patients means it is \"impossible to conduct the test right away,\" an official at the wuhan centre for disease control and prevention told reuters.    three hospital and local government workers, who have been briefed on how doctors are handling tests and confirming cases, told reuters that official numbers of infections and deaths do not reflect the actual toll.    wuhan health authorities have a limit on tests, chiefly because of the shortage of testing kits, and are screening lists of patients before deciding who gets a test, which takes several hours, one hospital worker told reuters.    \"some severely ill patients were left out from the final list for testing because they know they wouldn't be able to be treated,\" the worker told reuters. \"the actual deaths were higher.\"    reuters could not independently confirm the hospital worker's account. hubei and wuhan health authorities did not respond to reuters requests for comment.    zhang, whose mother is still waiting for a test, said doctors at three wuhan hospitals told her family privately that they are almost certain she has contracted the coronavirus.    however, he said two of those hospitals told him they are not equipped with testing kits, and the other told him it has no available bed to accommodate his mother for the test.    none of those hospitals replied \nto reuters requests for comment.    sixty-nine year-old xu enen, who has had fever and a lung infection since jan. 8, was rejected by six hospitals in wuhan for testing as they said they had ran out of beds, his daughter told reuters. xu's symptoms have worsened lately, and he is starting to have breathing difficulties.    he was finally admitted on jan. 22 to queue for the test at hankou hospital in wuhan after his daughter publicized his case on weibo.    researchers at lancaster university estimate that only 5.1% of infections in wuhan have been identified. by jan. 21, they estimated a total of 11,341 people had been infected in wuhan since the start of the year. more than 30,000 people in wuhan are under observation, according to the city's health authorities.    \"all we want is to confirm the case is the virus or not,\" said a 33-year-old wuhan woman surnamed liu, whose father has been on a respirator in hospital since jan. 14 and was still untested on monday. \"at least if it's confirmed we have a direction. if there's no direction, there's no hope.\" reuters ", "label": 0}, {"content": "China confirms the death of the doctor who alerted on the coronavirus after hours of confusion. Li Wenliang, the ophthalmologist who along with seven other doctors was the first to throw the alarm on the new Coronavirus and ended up getting sick himself, he has finally confirmed the Wuhan Hospital in which he was admitted and the Chinese State Press. The death has been ratified after hours of confusion in the country, because in the afternoon his death was announced, but later, in the midst of a wave of manifestations of pain and rage in social networks, the authorities of the country claimed that although The doctor had suffered a cardiac arrest, he was still alive and connected to an artificial respirator. Li Wenliang has finished his days converted into a national hero after being repreherent to \"spread rumors\". According to Wuhan's central hospital, Li had suffered a heart rate around 9:30 pm. But he had been connected to an ECMO machine (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation), a system that breathes air into the lungs and pumps blood through the circulatory system, so he was still alive, held artificially. With this announcement, the hospital managed to stop the riage of duel, at unusual levels in China, by a doctor who had become a national hero. and whose death, that of a young man and without apparent health problems - a profile very different from that the authorities describe as that of the most common victim of the virus, a person over 70 with other previous ailments - could generate a Popular reaction that endangers the sacrosanct priority for the Chinese regime, social stability. Finally, the hospital has announced that, this time, he had died. The 34-year-old doctor, married, with a son and another on the way, had written a message on December 30 in a group of ancient colleagues in social networks. According to him, he explained, at his hospital \nWuhan had entered seven patients, all of them with symptoms very similar to SARS, the epidemic caused by another coronavirus that in 2003 killed nearly 800 people. Li also needed that the seven patients had some kind of relationship with the fish market and seafood Huanan, where all kinds of wild animals were also sold and that it would later identify as the place where the infection was transmitted to the human being. When she wrote the message, Li did not intend to disseminate the information beyond the circle of friendship. Simply, he asked his former colleagues to be careful and who warned the families of him. But someone in the group began to spread it and the networks did the rest. Four days later she received a visit from the police: they accused him of \"spread rumors\", a position that in China can pose up to seven years in prison. Another seven doctors also received the same accusation. In the case of her, Li had to go to police station and sign a statement in which he admitted the lack of him and promised not to remember, before he was allowed to return to her house. On January 8 she attended a patient with glaucoma in the hospital, not knowing that she was a carrier of the virus. She on day 10 she began to feel bad, with the symptoms that causes that pathogen: sore throat, dry cough, fever, difficulty breathing. After two days he had to be admitted to a hospital, where he continued worse. Finally, on February 1 he received the diagnosis. He suffered atypical pneumonia that can cause virus, something that was commissioned to communicate in his Weibo account, Chinese Twitter. \"Today has come the nucleic acid test with a positive result. Luck is lying, finally diagnosed, \"he wrote. The case of Li had fed the fury of a Chinese audience that since the Wuhan blockade was declared and another fortnight of cities in Hubei, the province most affected by the epidemic, had harshly criticized the management of the \nAuthorities at the beginning of the crisis. Having allowed the public to bear ears to the allegations of the eight doctors, the clamor was lamented in the networks, citizens could have taken precautions. And if the local authorities, instead of silencing them, they would have been required, they would have been forced to take measures that would have slowed down the spread of the disease before. Now the virus has already killed more than 500 people and infected with more than 28,000, in China and close to thirty countries. Last week, China's own Supreme Court was right to those criticism. He issued a ruling in which he was very critical with the behavior of the police. As he claimed, he should have allowed him to circulate the warning of doctors. Although it was not true 100% - even related, the new Coronavirus is different from the causant of SARS - would have allowed the population to beaded by carrying masks or avoiding agglomerations. From your hospital bed, and while receiving thousands of messages of thanks and encouragement of numerous networks through social networks, it sent brief texts of tranquility in Weibo: they had not withdrawn the license to exercise as a result of the complaint; Nor was he going to report him to the police. It was enough for him to know the truth. This Thursday he suffered a heart failure that had numerous Chinese media announced the death of him. The World Health Organization was rushed to pay tribute. In a tuit, she declared \"deeply saddened by Dr. Li Wenliang's death. We must all celebrate the work he did about the # 2019-Ncov. \" In Wechat, Chinese whatsapp, and other social networks also multiplied citizen tribute to the doctor, in an unprecedented wave by their number, sadness and rage. \"it's terrible. It really is a death that should not have happened. He was so young. I'm sorry, \"said an internet that identified as\" ai \nDANDAN \". \"This time the fresh five-star flag (La China) is in debt with you,\" said another. After the announcement of the hospital, the pain messages were changed by others of mind. Although some already seemed to anticipate an announcement of the death in the future, when that possibility had covered between the population and the reaction of public opinion outside, predictably, less angry: \"Remember later how we feel now,\" a user of the networks pointed out . Now, at dawn in China, it has returned the wave of messages from duel after the confirmation of the death of Li Wenliang, also confirmed at Weibo.

Researchers at the University of Texas have made a significant advance in the development of a vaccine for the new coronavirus, creating the first 3D atomic range map of the virus part that attacks and infects human cells.\nmapping the 'spike' protein, which exists on the surface of the virus and is crucial for viral fixation and its entry into the host cell, is an essential step so that researchers from around the world can develop antiviral vaccines and drugs Combat the virus, according to an article published today in the magazine \"Science\".\nThe team of researchers at the University of Texas in Austin and the national health institutes is also working on a potential vaccine related to the investigation that is developing. Jason McLellan, associate professor at UT Austin who led the investigation, and his colleagues spent many years studying other coronaviruses, including SARS-COV and MERS-COV.\nThe researchers had already developed methods to block coronavirus 'spike' proteins in a way that made them easier to analyze and could effectively transform them into potential vaccines. This experience gave them an advantage over other research teams studying the new virus.\n\"As soon as we knew that it was a coronavirus, we felt that we had to lean on him,\" says Jason McLellan, adding, \"We knew exactly what mutations put, because we have already shown that these mutations work for various other coronaviruses\" and as such We could be one of the first to get this structure. \"\nOnly two weeks after receiving the sequence of the genome of the Chinese investigator virus, the team designed and produced samples of the stabilized Spike protein.\nIt was accurate 12 days to rebuild the map on atomic 3D scale, called molecular structure, 'Spike' protein and send a manuscript to Science, which accelerated his peer review process. The many steps involved in this process would normally take months to complete.\nFundamental for success was state-of-the-art technology known as cryogenic electron microscopy (crio-em) in the new Sauer laboratory of UT Austin structural biology. Cryo-in allows researchers to make 3D models on a atomic scale of cellular structures, molecules and viruses.\nThe molecule that the team produced, and for which they obtained a structure, represents only the extracellular portion of the Spike protein, but it is sufficient to provoke an immune response in people and thus serve as a vaccine.\nThen McLellan's team plans to use its molecule to pursue another line of attack against the virus that causes Covid-19, as a \"probe\" to isolate antibodies naturally produced from patients who were infected with the new coronavirus and recovered with success.\nIn large quantities, these antibodies can help treat coronavirus infection shortly after exposure. For example, antibodies could protect soldiers or health professionals sent in an area with high rates of infection at warning too short for the immunity of a vaccine to enter into force.\nCoronavirus Covid-19, which appeared at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, capital of the Chinese province of Hubei (center) caused 2,004 dead in continental China and more than 74,000 infected worldwide. Outside China, there are two dead dead in Hong Kong, a dead in the Philippines, one in Japan, one in France and one in Taiwan.\nThe Chinese authorities isolated several cities from the province of Hubei, in the center of the country, to try to control the epidemic, which covers about 60 million people.

have died from the coronavirus. in south korea, hit by the disease at about the same time, only a few thousand are quarantined and 67 people have died. as the virus courses through the world, the story of two outbreaks illustrates a coming problem for countries now grappling with an explosion in cases.    it's impractical to test every potential patient, but unless the authorities can find a way to see how widespread infection is, their best answer is lockdown.    italy started out testing widely, then narrowed the focus so that now, the authorities don't have to process hundreds of thousands of tests. but there's a trade-off: they can't see what's coming and are trying to curb the movements of the country's entire population of 60 million people to contain the disease. even pope francis, who has a cold and delivered his sunday blessing over the internet from inside the vatican, said he felt \"caged in the library.\"    thousands of miles away in south korea, authorities have a different response to a similar-sized outbreak. they are testing hundreds of thousands of people for infections and tracking potential carriers like detectives, using cell phone and satellite technology.    both countries saw their first cases of the disease called covid-19 in late january. south korea has since reported 67 deaths out of nearly 8,000 confirmed cases, after testing more than 222,000 people. in contrast, italy has had 1,016 deaths and identified more than 15,000 cases after carrying out more than 73,000 tests on an unspecified number of people.    epidemiologists say it is not possible to compare the numbers directly. but some say the dramatically different outcomes point to an important insight: aggressive and sustained testing is a powerful tool for fighting the virus.    jeremy konyndyk, a senior policy fellow \nat the center for global development in washington, said extensive testing can give countries a better picture of the extent of an outbreak. when testing in a country is limited, he said, the authorities have to take bolder actions to limit movement of people.    \"i'm uncomfortable with enforced lockdown-type movement restrictions,\" he said. \"china did that, but china is able to do that. china has a population that will comply with that.\"    the democracies of italy and south korea are useful case studies for countries such as america, which have had problems setting up testing systems and are weeks behind on the infection curve. so far, in japan and the united states particularly, the full scale of the problem is not yet visible. germany has not experienced significant testing constraints, but chancellor angela merkel warned her people on wednesday that since 60% to 70% of the populace is likely to be infected, the only option is containment.    south korea, which has a slightly smaller population than italy at about 50 million people, has around 29,000 people in self-quarantine. it has imposed lockdowns on some facilities and at least one apartment complex hit hardest by outbreaks. but so far no entire regions have been cut off.    seoul says it is building on lessons learned from an outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) in 2015 and working to make as much information available as possible to the public. it has embarked on a massive testing programme, including people who have very mild illness, or perhaps don't even have symptoms, but who may be able to infect others.    this includes enforcing a law that grants the government wide authority to access data: cctv footage, gps tracking data from phones and cars, credit card transactions, immigration entry information, and other personal details of people confirmed to have an infectious disease. the authorities can then make some of this public, so anyone who may have been exposed can get themselves - \nor their friends and family members - tested.    in addition to helping work out who to test, south korea's data-driven system helps hospitals manage their pipeline of cases. people found positive are placed in self-quarantine and monitored remotely through a smartphone app, or checked regularly in telephone calls, until a hospital bed becomes available. when a bed is available, an ambulance picks the person up and takes the patient to a hospital with air-sealed isolation rooms. all of this, including hospitalization, is free of charge.    south korea's response is not perfect. while more than 209,000 people have tested negative there, results are still pending on about 18,000 others - an information gap that means there are likely more cases in the pipeline. the rate of newly confirmed cases has dropped since a peak in mid-february, but the system's greatest test may still be ahead as authorities try to track and contain new clusters. south korea does not have enough protective masks - it has started rationing them - and it is trying to hire more trained staff to process tests and map cases.    and the approach comes at the cost of some privacy. south korea's system is an intrusive mandatory measure that depends on people surrendering what, for many in europe and america, would be a fundamental right of privacy. unlike china and the island-state of singapore, which have used similar methods, south korea is a large democracy with a population that is quick to protest policies it does not like.    \"disclosing information about patients always comes with privacy infringement issues,\" said choi jaewook, a preventive medicine professor at korea university and a senior official at the korean medical association. disclosures \"should be strictly limited\" to patients' movements, and \"it shouldn't be about their age, their sex, or their employers.\"    traditional responses such as locking down affected areas and isolating patients can be only modestly effective, and may \ncause problems in open societies, says south korea's deputy minister for health and welfare kim gang-lip. in south korea's experience, he told reporters on monday, lockdowns mean people participate less in tracing contacts they may have had. \"such an approach,\" he said, \"is close-minded, coercive, and inflexible.\"       italy \"at the limit\"    italy and south korea are more than 5,000 miles apart, but there are several similarities when it comes to coronavirus. both countries' main outbreaks were initially clustered in smaller cities or towns, rather than in a major metropolis - which meant the disease quickly threatened local health services. and both involved doctors who decided to ignore testing guidelines.    italy's epidemic kicked off last month. a local man with flu symptoms was diagnosed after he had told medical staff he had not been to china and discharged himself, said massimo lombardo, head of local hospital services in lodi.    the diagnosis was only made after the 38-year-old, whose name has only been given as mattia, returned to the hospital. testing guidelines at the time said it was not necessary to test people who had no link to china or other affected areas. but an anaesthetist pushed the protocols and decided to go ahead and test for covid-19 anyway, lombardo said. now, some experts in italy believe mattia may have been infected through germany, rather than china.    decisions about testing hinge partly on what can be done with people who test positive, at a time when the healthcare system is already under stress. in italy at first, regional authorities tested widely and counted all positive results in the published total, even if people did not have symptoms.    then, a few days after the patient known as mattia was found to have covid-19, italy changed tack, only testing and announcing cases of people with symptoms. the authorities said this was the most effective use of resources: the risk of contagion seemed lower from patients with no \nsymptoms, and limited tests help produce reliable results more quickly. the approach carried risks: people with no symptoms still can be infected and spread the virus.    on the other hand, the more you test the more you find, so testing in large numbers can put hospital systems under strain, said massimo antonelli, director of intensive care at the fondazione policlinico universitario agostino gemelli irccs in rome. testing involves elaborate medical processes and follow-up. \"the problem is actively searching for cases,\" he said. \"it means simply the numbers are big.\"    italy has a generally efficient health system, according to international studies. its universal healthcare receives funding below the european union average but is comparable with south korea's, at 8.9% of gdp against 7.3% in south korea, according to the world health organization.    now, that system has been knocked off balance. staff are being brought into accident and emergency departments, holidays have been cancelled and doctors say they are delaying non-urgent operations to free up intensive care beds.    pier luigi viale, head of the infectious disease unit at sant' orsola-malpighi hospital in bologna, is working around the clock - in three jobs. his hospital is handling multiple coronavirus cases. his doctors are shuttling to other hospitals and clinics in the area to lend their expertise and help out with cases. in addition, his doctors also have to deal with patients with other contagious diseases who are struggling to survive.    \"if it drags on for weeks or months we'll need more reinforcements,\" he told reuters.    last week, the mayor of castiglione d'adda, a town of about 5,000 people in lombardy's \"red zone\" which was the first to be locked down, made an urgent online appeal for help. he said his small town had had to close its hospital and was left with one doctor to treat more than 100 coronavirus patients. three of the town's four doctors were sick or in self quarantine. \n\"doctors and nurses are at the limit,\" said a nurse from the hospital where mattia was taken in. \"if you have to manage people under artificial respiration you have to be watching them constantly, you can't look after the new cases that come in.\"    studies so far suggest that every positive case of coronavirus can infect two other people, so local authorities in lombardy have warned that the region's hospitals face a serious crisis if the spread continues - not just for covid-19 patients but also for others whose treatment has been delayed or disrupted. as the crisis spreads into italy's less prosperous south, the problems will be magnified.    intensive care facilities face the most intense pressure. they require specialist staff and expensive equipment and are not set up for mass epidemics. in total, italy has around 5,000 intensive care beds. in the winter months, some of these are already occupied by patients with respiratory problems. lombardy and veneto have just over 1,800 intensive care beds between public and private systems, only some of which can be set aside for covid-19 patients.    the government has asked regional authorities to increase the number of intensive care places by 50% and to double the number of beds for respiratory and contagious diseases, while reorganising staff rosters to ensure adequate staffing. some 5,000 respirators have been acquired for intensive care stations, the first of which are due to arrive on friday, deputy economy minister laura castelli said.    the region has already asked nursing institutes to allow students to bring forward their graduation to get more nurses into the system early. pools of intensive care specialists and anaesthetists are to be set up, including staff from outside the worst affected regions.    to add to the burden, hospitals in italy depend on medical personnel to try to trace the contacts that people who test positive have had with others. one doctor in bologna, who asked not to be named, said he \nhad spent a 12-hour day tracing people who had been in contact with just one positive patient, to ensure those who next need testing are found.    \"you can do that if the number of cases remains two to three,\" the doctor said. \"but if they grow, something has to give. the system will implode if we continue to test everyone actively and then have to do all this.\"       \"maximum power\"    in south korea as in italy, an early case of covid-19 was identified when a medical officer followed their intuition, rather than the official guidelines, on testing.    the country's first case was a 35-year-old chinese woman who tested positive on jan. 20. but the largest outbreak was detected after the 31st patient, a 61-year-old woman from south korea's southeastern city of daegu, was diagnosed on feb. 18.    like the patient named mattia in italy, the woman had no known links to wuhan, the chinese province where the disease was first identified. and as in italy, the doctors' decision to recommend a test went against guidelines at the time to test people who had been to china or been in contact with a confirmed case, said korea medical association's choi jaewook.    \"patient 31,\" as she became known, was a member of a secretive church which deputy minister for health and welfare kim gang-lip said has since linked to 61% of cases. infections spread beyond the congregation after the funeral of a relative of the church's founder was held at a nearby hospital, and there were several other smaller clusters around the country.    once the church cluster was identified, south korea opened around 50 drive-through testing facilities around the country.    in empty parking lots, medical staff in protective clothing lean into cars to check their passengers for fever or breathing difficulties, and if needed, collect samples. the process usually takes about 10 minutes, and people usually receive the results in a text reminding them to wash their hands regularly and wear face masks.    a total \nof 117 institutions in south korea have equipment to conduct the tests, according to the korea centers for disease control and prevention (kcdc). the numbers fluctuate daily, but an average of 12,000 is possible, and maximum capacity is 20,000 tests a day. the government pays for tests of people with symptoms, if referred by a doctor. otherwise, people who want to be tested can pay up to 170,000 won ($140), said an official at a company called seegene inc, which supplies 80% of the country's kits and says it can test 96 samples at once.    there are also 130 quarantine officers like kim jeong-hwan, who focus on minute details to track potential patients. the 28-year-old public health doctor spends his whole working days remotely checking up on people who have tested positive for covid-19, the disease caused by the virus.    kim, who is doing military service, is one of a small army of quarantine officers who track the movements of any potential carriers of the disease by phone, app or the signals sent by cell phones or the black boxes in automobiles. their goal: to trace all the contacts people may have had, so they too can be tested.    \"i haven't seen anyone telling bad lies,\" kim said. \"but lots of people generally don't remember exactly what they did.\"    underlining their determination, quarantine officers told reuters they located five cases after a worker in a small town caught the virus and went to work in a \"coin karaoke,\" a bar where a machine lets people sing a few songs for a dollar. at first, the woman, who was showing symptoms, did not tell the officers where she worked, local officials told reuters. but they put the puzzle together after questioning her acquaintances and obtaining gps locations on her mobile device.    \"now, quarantine officers have maximum power and authority,\" said kim jun-geun, an official at changnyeong county who collects information from quarantine officers.    south korea's government also uses location data to customize mass \nmessages sent to cellphones, notifying every resident when and where a nearby case is confirmed.    lee hee-young, a preventative medicine expert who is also running the coronavirus response team in south korea's gyeonggi province, said south korea has gone some of the way after mers to increase its infrastructure to respond to infectious diseases. but she said only 30% of the changes the country needs have happened. for instance, she said, maintaining a trained workforce and up-to-date infrastructure at smaller hospitals isn't easy.    \"until we fix this,\" lee said, \"explosions like this can keep blowing up anywhere.\" reuters ", "label": 1}, {"content": "coronavirus.

wednesday invoked rarely used emergency powers to marshal critical medical supplies against the coronavirus pandemic. trump also signed an aid package which the senate approved earlier wednesday that will guarantee sick leave to workers who fall ill. trump tapped his authority under the 70-year-old defense production act to give the government more power to steer production by private companies and try to overcome shortages in masks, ventilators and other supplies. yet he seemed to minimize the urgency of the decision, later tweeting that he \"only signed the defense production act to combat the chinese virus should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future.\" \"hopefully there will be no need,\" he added, \"but we are all in this together!\" the mixed messaging came as trump took a series of other extraordinary steps to steady the nation, its day-to-day life suddenly and fundamentally altered. the canada-u.s. border, the world's longest, was effectively closed, save for commerce and essential travel, while the administration pushed its plan to send relief checks to millions of americans. trump said he will expand the nation's diagnostic testing capacity and deploy a navy hospital ship to new york city, which is rapidly becoming an epicenter of the pandemic, and another such ship to the west coast. and the housing and urban development department will suspend foreclosures and evictions through april to help the growing number of americans who face losing jobs and missing rent and mortgage payments. but as trump laid out efforts to help the economy, markets plummeted. gone were nearly all the gains that the dow jones industrial average had made since trump took office. the administration announcements came on a fast-moving day of developments across the capital, its empty streets standing \nin contrast to the whirlwind of activity inside the grand spaces of the white house and the capitol. the senate overwhelmingly passed a second coronavirus response bill, which trump signed wednesday night. the vote was a lopsided 90-8 despite worries by many republicans about a temporary new employer mandate to provide sick leave to workers who get covid-19. the measure is also aimed at making tests for the virus free. meanwhile the administration pushed forward its broad economic rescue plan, which proposes $500 billion in checks to millions of americans, with the first checks to come april 6 if congress approves. trump dismissed a suggestion from his own treasury secretary, steven mnuchin, that the nation could face 20% unemployment at least in the short term. that's an \"absolute total worst case scenario,\" trump said. \"we're no way near it.\" the government has told americans to avoid groups of more than 10 people and the elderly to stay home while a pointed reminder was given to millennials to follow the guidelines and avoid social gatherings. trump likened the effort to the measures taken during world war ii and said it would require national \"sacrifice.\" \"it's a war,\" he said. \"i view it as a, in a sense, a wartime president. it's a very tough situation.\" no longer able to run for reelection on a healthy economy, he was taking on the mantle of a wartime leader after played down the severity of the crisis for weeks. the president also employed more nativist, us-vs-them rhetoric at the briefing, continuing his recent habit of referring to the coronavirus as the \"chinese virus,\" which has been sharply criticized as racist. \"it's not racist at all,\" trump said. \"it comes from china, that's all.\" he was asked about a report that a white house aide had referred to the virus as the \"kung flu\" when talking to an asian-american reporter and trump did not signal disapproval of the offensive term. trump later met nursing leaders and expressed \"gratitude for those on the \nfront lines in our war against the global pandemic\" as he held out hope that the pandemic would be over soon. \"it's been something, but we're winning and we will win,\" he said. \"it's a question of when and i think it's going to go quickly. we hope it's going to go quickly.\" a limited number of people gathered around a large table, their chairs spread apart in a display of social distancing. the defense production act gives the president broad authority to shape the domestic industrial base so that it is capable of providing essential materials and goods needed in a national security crisis. the law allows the president to require businesses and corporations to give priority to and accept contracts for required materials and services. the executive order issued by trump gives health and human services secretary alex azar the authority to determine \"the proper nationwide priorities and allocation of all health and medical resources, including controlling the distribution of such materials ... in the civilian market, for responding to the spread of covid-19 within the united states.\" it also applies to certain health services. trump also said he would soon invoke a rarely used federal statute that would enable the u.s. to tighten controls along the southwest border because of the new coronavirus, based on a recommendation of the u.s. surgeon general. the president said the law, intended to halt the spread of communicable diseases, would give authorities \"great latitude\" to help control the outbreak. earlier, u.s. officials told the associated press that the administration would invoke the law to immediately turn back all people who cross the border illegally from mexico and to refuse people the right to claim asylum there. more than eight weeks after the first u.s. case of the virus was detected, the federal government is still struggling to conduct widescale testing for the virus. compounding the problem, laboratories are reporting shortages of supplies needed to run \nthe tests, which officials urged to be given to those most likely to have covid-19. deborah birx, who is coordinating the white house response, cautioned that there has been a backlog of swabs waiting in labs to be tested, and as that backlog clears \"we will see the number of people diagnosed dramatically increased\" in the next few days. asked about the administration's mixed messages when it comes to the threat posed by the virus, birx said new studies about how long the virus can be transmissible on hard surfaces helped prompt the administration's tightening of recommendations on social distancing. \"none of us really understood\" that, she said. \"we're still working out how much is by human transmission and how much is it by surface.\" she added, \"don't exposure yourself to surfaces outside the home.\" for most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. the vast majority of people recover from the new virus. according to the world health organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. as it tries to get its message to the public, the white house said a series of ads, digital and on television, will feature the president and first lady melania trump urging americans to follow the guidelines. birx also renewed her call for younger people to follow federal guidelines and stop meeting in groups. she said there have been \"concerning reports\" from france and italy about young people becoming seriously ill. the task force last week urged young generations to avoid going out to bars and restaurants and to avoid groups of more than 10 people. \"we cannot have these large gatherings that continue throughout the country for people who are off work,\" birx said. she added that the federal pandemic task force \nso far has not seen any \"significant mortality\" in children. the white house has had several coronavirus-related health scares, with the president himself exposed to at least three people who later tested positive. republican national committee chairwoman ronna mcdaniel said wednesday that she had tested negative for the virus. mcdaniel, who met last week with the president and senate republicans, had previously been exposed to someone who tested positive.

the middle of january can expect delays due to the covid-19 outbreak and extended chinese new year break in china, e-commerce companies told today on friday (feb 14).   today spoke to 10 customers of e-commerce companies ezbuy, qoo10, lazada and shopee, who said that their orders had been delayed or cancelled as retailers in china had not dispatched their items, and had not given them reasons for the holdup.   a lazada spokesperson said that delays are expected for orders placed after jan 20 due to the extended chinese new year holiday in china implemented because of the covid-19 outbreak, and the wider implications of the outbreak.   \u201cwe are expecting orders placed after jan 20 to have processing and shipping delays,\u201d the spokesperson told today.   \u201cwe have communicated this to affected customers and offered to facilitate cancellation for those who wished to,\u201d the spokesperson said, but declined to comment on whether cancellation policies will be different during this period.   lazada is closely monitoring the situation and working with its partners to help sellers.   \u201cas the shopping experience for our consumers continues to be our top priority, we are exercising all efforts to better match the demand with supply by leveraging our technology and logistics capabilities within lazada and the alibaba economy,\u201d the spokesperson added.   lazada is controlled by china's e-commerce giant alibaba.   an ezbuy spokesperson said there had been some parcel delays caused by a pause in operations by manufacturers, suppliers, couriers and logistics firms.   \"however, with more suppliers resuming their operations this week, including domestic couriers and international logistic companies, we have observed that things are gradually progressing

meantime, we will continue to closely monitor the covid-19 situation, and we remain committed to protecting the well-being of our users during this time,\u201d the spokesperson said.   possible reasons for delayed orders   assistant professor yuen kum fai at the nanyang technological university (ntu) school of civil and environmental engineering said that the delays of orders could be due to the cancellation of freight services, resulting in a shortage of the items.   \u201ci believe the delays are caused by both international and domestic shipping. however, restricted international flights might be a bigger contributor to delays,\u201d he said.   he added that increased health measures for drivers could have slowed down local transportation of goods in china.   \u201cthe increase in administration, health screening and checks on drivers could further slow down the process,\u201d he said.   professor lawrence loh at the national university of singapore (nus) business school said that the delays could be due to a shortage of workers at manufacturing companies, warehouses and transport companies due to the outbreak.   \u201cworkers could not be going back to their companies due to health reasons as they may be quarantined,\u201d he said. \u201cor they could be fearful to return.\u201d   he added that e-commerce sites can turn to exporters from other countries such as south korea or india instead of china during this period.   mr lucas tok, a lecturer at the singapore polytechnic school of business, said that e-commerce companies here could find it difficult to inform customers about the reasons for delayed orders as the companies might not know why either.   \u201cthe situation in china is changing very quickly \nand there needs to be fast decisions made on the ground there regarding the businesses,\u201d he said. \u201cthere might be a mismatch of information and not regular updates between china and companies here.\u201d   delayed or cancelled orders   customers of e-commerce sites said that their orders were cancelled as retailers in china did not dispatch their items and did not give reasons for it.   ms kelly poon, 39, who works in customer service, said that her ezbuy parcel that she placed on jan 19 has still not arrived as the retailer in china has not dispatched it.   \u201ci asked ezbuy about it and there wasn't really a good reply,\u201d she said. \u201ci was just asked to wait, with no estimated timeline or prompt updates.\u201d   undergraduate joel ng, 26, said that of the 10 orders of household items that

Normally, many small transporters and trucks are on the former Roman road. The Bassa Lodigiana, southeast of Milan, in which the Coronavirus Lombard infectious stove is a very productive economic area. In the ten communities under quarantine, 3,400 companies are sitting, including the international group Unilever, and 170 livestock farms. The first barrier, which is encountered by Milan about Via Emilia, is the CasalpusterLego. 15,200 people live here. The barrier is already four kilometers in front of it, in a suburb. Two police cars block the passage. Three policemen and a policewoman, all with mouthguard, stand guard, make small transporters and cars only when the driver has the approval issued by the prefecture. At the parking lot right next to the barrier, a woman sees the whole for a while and then shakes his head: \"Let's hope the spook is coming soon,\" she says. Annalisa does not want to call her surname, is around 50 and lives in the provincial capital Lodi. It was here because of its 80-year-old mother, who live in Codogno, so in the community, from where the Coronavirus has spread to the other nine quarantines. Annalisa today brought two pockets full of food to the roadblock and delivered to the security forces. On the other hand, her mother, which were handed over the pockets was. \"No, it's not that it lacks food in the blocking zone, but I feel safer if I care for my mother himself.\" Annalisa is not an individual case, says one of the policemen. Every day, friends, children, relatives come with full shopping bags. To do something for the people behind the barrier, too \nSoothing. \"At the weekend, just after the brimming of the red zone, the location here was temporarily tense,\" says the official. Some would not have wanted to accept that they did not rain out, others wanted to get in to get their laptop quickly. \"Today, the situation seems quiet and in general the population reacts very responsibly.\" So it also sees Elia Delmiglio, the 25-year-old mayor of Casalpusterlengo, which we reach by phone. \"It's a surreal situation that we experience here,\" he says right at the beginning. Everyday life has changed dramatically. \"The cafes have closed, you can not work, the weekly market is canceled. Only the pharmacies and grocery stores are open.\" But his fellow citizens are well supplied. In CasalpusterLengo there are seven supermarkets, three butchers, seven bakers and daily coming. At the weekend, it had come to small rushes on the supermarkets, but now everything is normal again. That people would only let go into small groups, be a pure security precaution and only to their well-being. \"As I said, there is no emergency, neither what the food is concerned, still in gasoline or money to the ATM,\" repeats Delmiglio. But not all seem to share his mind. For example, Pietro Meazzi, a worker from Casalpusterlengo, described the daily newspaper La Repubblica a completely different location. In the communities of the red zone you have to stand for hours to buy shopping, and if you finally be in the store, you often stand before empty fruit and vegetables. That's why he organized himself with a few friends and together they would shop for themselves and older fellow citizens in the nearby, not quarantined village of San Rocco. To work around the locks is not difficult, instead of driving along the road you just take the dirt roads. You can \nBut people are not easy to lock. The fact that there are several evasive routes along the fields, the authorities also know and have recently increased the barriers around the quarantine area of \u200b\u200b15 to 35 and the security forces used to 500. In use, not only policies, but also Carabinieri, financial police and armed forces. Who violates the regulations, risks a fine and up to three months imprisonment. The coordination of food supply of the 50,000 inhabitants of the quarantine area is the task of prefecture in Lodi. \"They also adopt the passage permissions for the suppliers,\" explains Pietro Foroni, Council member of Lombard regional administration and responsible for civil protection. He too repeatedly repeated that none of the ten communities of foods are still in any of the ten communities. \"I also know first-hand, because my parents live in the red zone.\" In each community there is a comitato operativo comunale (COC), a local emission force of civil protection, to which the citizens could always apply: \"The COC staff also to take care of those patients who have been tested positive on the coronavirus, but none Have disease symptoms and are therefore quarantined at home. For these they do the purchases or get them the necessary drugs. \" The message, which Foroni is particularly important, is the following: \"We performed 3,500 tests in just four days, France in the same time span just 400.\" Clear that you push more positive cases. Walter Ricciardi, special adviser of the World Health Organization at the Italian Minister of Health, recently once again pointed out that \"from a hundreds of virus diseased, eighty of himself, fifteen serious cases are and five fatal: 95 percent of patients will be healthy again.\" The situation was also the situation from the health ministers from the \nNeighboring countries Germany, Austria, France, Slovenia, Switzerland and the competent EU Commissioner Stella Kyriakides described. And so they decided at the end of their meeting in Rome, the limits not to close for the time being. Meanwhile, the number of positive patients continues to increase: in all Italy, it is far more than 300, most of them in the regions of Lombardy and Veneto, and eleven dead. The further infection cases in Liguria, in Tuscany and Sicily were all patients recently in Lombardy. How long the barriers to the red zone still stay and where still needs to be locked, no one can say that at the moment. But people are worried, just like that. At the end of 2019, China's World Health Organization WHO reported a pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause from Wuhan. A week later, researchers identified a novel virus as the cause: they called it 2019-NCOV. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. Meanwhile, it is known as SARS COV-2 (COV stands for coronavirus, SARS for a respiratory disease triggered by a similar pathogen). SARS-COV-2 could have spread from a food market in Wuhan. There, exotic animals like reptiles were also sold. The lung disease that can trigger the new virus is now referred to as COVID-19 (English for coronavirus disease; Coronavirus disease). The disease is a so-called zoonose - a plague through a pathogen from the animal kingdom. Parts of virus bodies of SARS COV-2 same pathogens affecting bats. The new virus could have been transferred to humans via a still unknown intermediary. Both the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as well as Mers (MIDDLE East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses which have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic infected in the years 2002 and 2003, for example \n8,000 people, more than 750 died. With the Mers virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. In total there are several hundred types of coronaviren. Many of them affect the respiratory tract and can cause colds. Medizors and physicians assume that the virus is transmitted above all about droplet infection from person to person. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals. More than 200,000 cases of Corona worldwide (as of March 18th) were now registered. Added to this is a high number of dark figure, the researchers roughly suspect somewhere between 50 and 80 percent of all cases. Several thousand people have demonstrably died worldwide. In most, the infection is very mild. Among the deaths are mainly people with severe pre-existence and older people. The course of the registered cases in Germany can be tracked here on this map. The number of infected worldwide, which have been positively tested on Corona, shows this map of Johns-Hopkins University. That can not be said yet. The WHO announced on January 28, that about one-fifth of the persons filed as an infected persons through the virus will be severely ill, so in case of doubt should be treated intensive care. Meanwhile, the WHO classifies the disease as a pandemic. Diverse states have imposed entry and outgoing restrictions to slow the spread. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. States around the world have now reported infection cases, including Germany.

of which more than 800 have been fatal - over the past two months. that has surpassed the 774 fatalities from the 2002-2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or sars, over eight months, according to the world health organisation (who).   in the first 17,000 or so cases, about 82 per cent are mild, 15 per cent severe and 3 per cent critical, the who said friday. of 138 patients admitted to zhongnan hospital of wuhan university in the first four weeks of january, 26 per cent were placed in intensive care and 4.3 per cent died, a study in the journal of the american medical association published friday found.   while the fast-moving, infectious coronavirus has caused thousands of people to fall gravely ill and overwhelm hospitals, once researchers understand the full spectrum of illness associated with the virus, the overall case-fatality risk is likely to be much less than 1 per cent, said dr ian lipkin, director of the centre for infection and immunity at columbia university's mailman school of public health in new york.   people with mild or no apparent symptoms aren't currently being counted among cases, he told reporters sunday. a slowdown in the increase in reported cases over the past few days is \"meaningful,\" according to dr lipkin, who recently \nreturned to the us from china, where he was advising on the outbreak. he spoke with journalists during a 14-day home quarantine.   if measures taken so far to contain the outbreak are effective, some \"dramatic reductions\" in infections should be observed in the third or fourth weeks of february, he said. warmer, early-spring weather might also impede transmission, he said.   some studies indicate an infected person may not display symptoms for 14 days or more, with testing and confirmation of cases adding to delays. this will prolong the time it will take to identify whether china's unprecedented disease-control measures have worked.   \"the next two weeks are really critical to understand what's been happening,\" said dr benjamin cowling, head of epidemiology and biostatistics at the university of hong kong, in an interview in melbourne on thursday.   \"and, is this going to spread into other locations, or have we avoided what could be a global pandemic because of the control measures that have been implemented to date?\"   the number of cases reported in wuhan and across hubei province has been tracking downward over the past several days.   \"there has been a stabilisation in the number of cases reported from hubei, and we're in a four-day stable period where the number of reported cases hasn't advanced,\" dr mike ryan, executive director of the who's health emergencies programme, told reporters in geneva saturday.   \"that's good news and may reflect the impact of the control measures that have been put in place.\"   there has been a \"low, but steady incidence\" of infections in places outside hubei, dr ryan said. it's unclear which of those provinces may control the disease or where it might escalate, he said.   \"we hope that the same stabilisation that appears to be occurring in wuhan also occurs outside,\" dr ryan said. \"but, again it's very, very, very early to make any predictions about numbers.\" \"this is still a very intense disease outbreak in wuhan and hubei, and \nthere are still great risks in practically all of the other provinces, so we will wait and see,\" he said.

(repeats friday\u2019s column with no changes to text) * (the opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for reuters) * global semiconductor sales: tmsnrt.rs/2pty8vy * indonesian tin exports: tmsnrt.rs/2t7w82t by andy home london, feb 28 (reuters) - global production of refined tin fell by 6.6% to 334,400 tonnes in 2019, according to the international tin association (ita), but as the coronavirus outbreak saps demand and hobbles china\u2019s supply chains, it could fall to indonesia to balance the market. last year\u2019s production drop was down to lower run-rates in china, where smelters said in september they would curtail output in the face of a three-year low in the tin price and squeezed margins. major chinese producers such as yunnan tin, yunnan chengfeng and guangxi china tin saw year-on-year production falls of 7.5%, 16.6% and 10.9% respectively, according to the ita. not so indonesia\u2019s state-controlled producer pt timah, which concentrated its control over the country\u2019s production at the expense of independent smelters and more than doubled its output to 76,400 tonnes, surging past yunnan tin to claim the top global producer spot following a power play in indonesia\u2019s fractious tin politics. the company\u2019s new quasi-monopoly on indonesian tin processing sees it emerge as the key player in balancing any immediate dip in demand resulting from the coronavirus outbreak. greater producer discipline going forward should prove a positive for the tin price in a market that looks as if it\u2019s going to need to further restrain output this year. london metal exchange (lme) tin tumbled from $17,900 per tonne to $15,690 over the last week of january as fears over the economic fallout from coronavirus chilled the entire base metals complex. a weak rebound ran out of momentum around the $16,750 level and prices are once again heading south with lme three-month metal touching a low of \n$16,000 on friday morning. lme stocks hit a near five-year high of 7,595 tonnes on tuesday thanks to the warranting of another 250 tonnes at los angeles, hot on the heels of the 1,000 tonnes that appeared at the same port on feb. 17. los angeles is a highly unusual location for lme tin stock movements, which tend to be concentrated on asian locations such as singapore and malaysia. indeed, the last time los angeles held any lme-warranted tin was in april 2004 when total inventory was a single lot, or 5 tonnes. absent any obvious pull from lme spread tightness, the influx of metal on the u.s. west coast looks worryingly like a reaction to backed-up asian supply chains. lme time-spreads, often prone to rolling backwardations, are currently relaxed with the cash-to-three-months period cmsn0-3 closing thursday valued at a contango of $22 per tonne. tin, like other industrial metals, is highly exposed to the freeze on supply chains caused by the multiple quarantine measures being imposed by governments to contain the virus. the city of wuhan, the epicentre of the original outbreak, is a hub for high-end manufacturing, including semiconductors. tin is used as a soldering agent in semiconductors and the sector accounted for almost half of total demand in 2018. tin demand fell around 2% last year with weakness in semiconductors a key contributor, according to the findings of an ita survey of consumers conducted in october last year. the semiconductor association estimates global sales fell 12.1% last year, reflecting \u201congoing global trade unrest and cyclicality in product pricing.\u201d there was, however, a marked improvement in semiconductor trade over the fourth quarter and hopes were high for a turnaround in 2020 feeding through to better demand for tin. those hopes are now steadily diminishing as the virus spreads. china bottle-necked chinese metal producers normally keep operating over the lunar new year holidays, albeit at reduced rates, while downstream manufacturers \nshut up shop completely. tin is no exception and the short-term threat is of a surge in unsold metal stocks as manufacturers delay their return to work. so far at least, that\u2019s not obvious from the shanghai futures exchange tin contract. the seasonal build in exchange stocks has totalled a relatively mild 1,039 tonnes since the start of january and the front part of the tin curve is in backwardation, implying no immediate surplus. moreover, chinese production is likely to remain constrained by raw material shortages, which were an underlying motivation for the coordinated production cuts announced in september. the country\u2019s dependence on imports of tin concentrates from myanmar has become problematic with flows slowing as easily-accessible reserves dry up. imports from myanmar have fallen over each of the last three years, last year by 20%. they may now have stopped altogether as borders are quarantined. china\u2019s own logistic chains are bottle-necked. the inflow of concentrates to smelters in gejiu province \u201cis completely blocked,\u201d the ita said, adding that \u201csmelters without integrated mines are working through already low concentrate stocks.\u201d indonesia is already the world\u2019s largest exporter of refined tin, but previous attempts to flex market muscle have foundered on the lack of cohesion in a fractured producer landscape. pt timah\u2019s production surge last year marked a major victory in a long-running political battle with the independent smelters clustered on the tin-rich islands of bangka and belitung. the indonesian authorities in late 2018 suspended pt surveyor indonesia, which was checking independent smelters\u2019 exports were legally sourced. with official export channels closed, the smelters stopped operating, freeing up more raw material for timah, which used a different pre-export survey company. timah\u2019s ambitions are undiminished. the company has just started construction on a new 40,000 tonne-per-year smelting plant as it looks to cement its position as top \nglobal producer. in its newly dominant position timah theoretically has much greater market clout. \u201cwe cannot control global prices but we can control and maintain our export volume,\u201d the company\u2019s corporate secretary abdullah umar baswedan told the jakarta post. it started reducing sales in the third quarter of last year, when the tin price slumped to a three-year low of $15,565 per tonne. timah \u201cis committed to gradually cut its export sales volumes\u201d in response to global market dynamics, the company said in its q3 2019 financial report. total indonesian exports, which by definition are now almost exclusively shipments made by timah, fell by 12% to 67,700 tonnes last

that causes covid-19 can linger in the air for at least 30 minutes and travel up to 4.5 metres\u00a0\u2014 further than the \"safe distance\" advised by health authorities around the world, according to a study by a team of chinese government epidemiologists.   the researchers also found that it can last for days on surfaces where respiratory droplets land, raising the risk of transmission if an unsuspecting person touches it and then rubs their face and hands.   the length of time it lasts on the surface depends on factors such as temperature and the type of surface, for example at around 37c, it can survive for two to three days on glass, fabric, metal, plastic or paper.   these findings, from a group of official researchers from hunan province investigating a cluster case, challenge the advice from health authorities around the world that people should remain apart at a \"safe distance\" of one to two metres (three to six and a half feet).    graphic: south china morning post   \"it can be confirmed that in a closed environment with air-conditioning, the transmission distance of the new coronavirus will exceed the commonly recognised safe distance,\" the researchers wrote in a paper published in peer-review journal practical preventive medicine last friday.   the paper also highlighted the risk that the virus could remain afloat even after the carrier had left the bus.   the scientists warned that the coronavirus could survive more than five days in human faeces or bodily fluids.   they said the study proves the importance of washing hands and wearing face masks in public places because the virus can linger in the air attached to fine droplet particles.   \"our advice is to wear a face mask all the way [through the bus ride],\" they added.   their work was based on a local outbreak case on jan 22 during the peak lunar new year travel \nseason. a passenger, known as \"a\", boarded a fully booked long-distance coach and settled down on the second row from the back.   the passenger already felt sick at that point but it was before china had declared the coronavirus outbreak a national crisis, so \"a\" did not wear a mask, nor did most of the other passengers and driver on the 48-seat bus.   china requires closed circuit television cameras to be installed on all long-distance buses, which provided valuable footage for researchers to reconstruct the spread of the virus on the bus, whose windows were all closed.   mr hu shixiong, the lead author of the study who works for the hunan provincial centre for diseases control and prevention, said the security camera footage showed patient \"a\" did not interact with others throughout the four-hour ride.   but by the time the bus stopped at the next city, the virus had already jumped from the carrier to seven other passengers.   these included not only people sitting relatively close to \"patient zero\", but also a couple of victims six rows away from him \u2014 roughly 4.5 metres away.   they all later tested positive, including one passenger who displayed no symptoms of the disease.   after these passengers left, another group got on the bus about 30 minutes later. one passenger sitting in the front row on the other side of the aisle also became infected.   hu said the patient, who was not wearing a mask, was likely to have inhaled aerosols, or tiny particles, breathed out by the infected passengers from the previous group.   aerosols are light-weighted particles that are formed from tiny droplets of bodily fluids.   \"the possible reason is that in a completely enclosed space, the airflow is mainly driven by the hot air generated by the air conditioning. the rise of the hot air can transport the virus-laden droplets to a greater distance,\" said the paper.   after getting off the shuttle bus, the initial carrier got on a minibus and travelled for another hour. the virus \njumped to two other passengers, one of whom was also sitting 4.5 metres away from patient \"a\".   by the time the study was finished in mid february, patient \"a\" had infected at least 13 people.   it is generally believed that the airborne transmission of covid-19 is limited because the tiny droplets produced by patients will quickly sink to the ground.   this belief has prompted the chinese health authorities to suggest that people should stay a metre apart in public and the us centres for disease control recommend a safe distance of six feet (about 1.8 metres).   the researchers also found that none of those passengers in the two buses who wore face masks were infected.   they said it vindicated the decision to ask people to wear a face mask in public.   \"when riding on more closed public transportation such as subways, cars, planes, etc, you should wear a mask all the time, and at the same time, minimise the contact between your hands and public areas, and avoid touching your face before cleaning,\" they said.   the researchers also suggested improving sanitation on public transport and adjusting the air conditioning to maximise the volume of fresh air supplied.   they also said interiors should cleaned and disinfected once or twice a day, especially after passengers arrive at the terminal.   a doctor in beijing involved in the diagnosis and treatment of covid-19 patients said the study had left some questions unanswered.   for instance, the passengers sitting immediately next to the carriers were not infected, though they were suffering the highest exposure to the disease-bearing aerosols.   \"our knowledge about this

glass or share a plate, but did split a flourless chocolate torte for dessert. there was no end-of-date kiss, jones said, although he does have plans to see the woman again soon. jones said he expects the online dating world to change dramatically. \u201cwe are all well-versed on stds,\u201d jones said. \u201cnow, a sniffle or cough is a lot more frightening than it was a few months ago.\u201d for

The decision was not easy, said state governor Andrew Cuomo, according to media reports on Wednesday evening (local time). However, health experts agree that large events and narrow contacts would have to be restricted to curb the spread of the virus. The parade planned for the 17th of March in honor of the Irish Protection Patroon Sankt Patrick should take place later, it was said. In the Proclamation Trumps published by the White House, it was said that foreigners who held in the previous 14 days in the 26 Schengen states should no longer enter the US. Trump said to the grounds: \"The EU has failed to meet the same precautions (as the US) and to restrict travel from China and other crisis herds.\" That has led to a spread of the virus in the US. Trump said, \"We have seen dramatically less cases of the virus in the US than now in Europe.\" The president does not miss that the US has so far only tested relatively little suspected cases on the virus.

After the start of the crisis of CDC delivered tests delivered partly faulty results, it also came to bottlenecks. Critics threw trump, not to have reacted energetically enough to the crisis. Trump had already had an entry stop for foreign travelers at the end of January, which had been in China in the 14 days before. From China, the Coronavirus SARS COV-2 had spread. At the end of February, the US President then issued a corresponding regulation for foreigners who have stopped in Iran in the two weeks earlier. At the same time, the travel instructions for affected parts of Italy and South Korea were tightened. In Iran, in South Korea and Italy, the virus has spread rapidly. Trump said, \"We are in a critical phase in the fight against the virus.\" He was confident that the US would master the crisis. \"The virus will not have a chance against us,\" he said. \"No nation is better prepared and more resistant than the United States.\" Trump called not to make the crisis in the ongoing election campaign. \"We have to leave the policy aside, stop partiality and combine us as a nation and a family.\" The White House shared with, Trump have canceled events in Colorado and Nevada as a precautionary measure. Trump had said at a meeting with bosses of banks, in China and Asia flare the crisis. \"As you know, we have another part of the world, Europe that is in a very difficult Constitution.\" Shortly before, the managing vice-home protection minister Ken Cuccinelli had said in a congress hearing, travel restrictions for Europe would be considered. \"Europe is a unique problem.\" Reason for this \nBe sure that there are cross-border freedom of movement in the Schengen area. Therefore, the question is \"how to treat Europe as a whole\".

", "label": 1}, {"content": "covid-19 far more likely than sars to bond to human cells due to hiv-like mutation, scientists say. hong kong \u2014 the new coronavirus has a hiv-like mutation that means its ability to bind with human cells could be up to 1,000 times as strong as the sars virus, according to new research by scientists in china and europe.   the discovery could help to explain not only how the infection has spread but also where it came from and how best to fight it.   scientists showed that sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) entered the human body by binding with a receptor protein called ace2 on a cell membrane. and some early studies suggested that the new coronavirus, which shares about 80 per cent of the genetic structure of sars, might follow a similar path.   but the ace2 protein does not exist in large quantities in healthy people, and this partly helped to limit the scale of the sars outbreak of 2002-03, in which infected about 8,000 people around the world.   other highly contagious viruses, including hiv and ebola, target an enzyme called furin, which works as a protein activator in the human body. many proteins are inactive or dormant when they are produced and have to be \"cut\" at specific points to activate their various functions.   when looking at the genome sequence of the new coronavirus, professor ruan jishou and his team at nankai university in tianjin found a section of mutated genes that did not exist in sars, but were similar to those found in hiv and ebola.   \"this finding suggests that 2019-ncov [the new coronavirus] may be significantly different from the sars coronavirus in the infection pathway,\" the scientists said in a paper published this month on chinaxiv.org, a platform used by the chinese academy of sciences to release scientific research papers before they have been peer-reviewed.   \"this virus may use the packing mechanisms of other viruses such as hiv.\"   according to the study, the mutation can generate a structure known as a cleavage site in \nthe new coronavirus' spike protein.   the virus uses the outreaching spike protein to hook on to the host cell, but normally this protein is inactive. the cleavage site structure's job is to trick the human furin protein, so it will cut and activate the spike protein and cause a \"direct fusion\" of the viral and cellular membranes.   compared to the sars' way of entry, this binding method is \"100 to 1,000 times\" as efficient, according to the study.   just two weeks after its release, the paper is already the most viewed ever on chinarxiv.   in a follow-up study, a research team led by professor li hua from huazhong university of science and technology in wuhan, hubei province, confirmed professor ruan's findings.   the mutation could not be found in sars, mers or bat-covratg13, a bat coronavirus that was considered the original source of the new coronavirus with 96 per cent similarity in genes, it said.   this could be \"the reason why sars-cov-2 is more infectious than other coronaviruses\", professor li wrote in a paper released on chinarxiv on sunday.   meanwhile, a study by french scientist etienne decroly at aix-marseille university, which was published in the scientific journal antiviral research on february 10, also found a \"furin-like cleavage site\" that is absent in similar coronaviruses.   a researcher with the beijing institute of microbiology, chinese academy of sciences in beijing, said the studies were all based on genetic sequencing.   \"whether [the virus] behaves as predicted will need other evidence including experiments,\" said the researcher who asked not to be named.   \"the answer will tell how the virus makes us ill,\" he said.   scientists' understanding of the new coronavirus has changed dramatically over the past few months.   at first the virus was not considered a major threat, with the chinese centres for disease control and prevention saying there was no evidence off human-to-human transmission.   but that assumption was soon invalidated, and \nas of wednesday, there had been more than 81,000 confirmed infections around the world.   chinese researchers said drugs targeting the furin enzyme could have the potential to hinder the virus' replication in the human body. these include \"a series of hiv-1 therapeutic drugs such as indinavir, tenofovir alafenamide, tenofovir disoproxil and dolutegravir and hepatitis c therapeutic drugs including boceprevir and telaprevir\", according to professor li's study.   this suggestion is in line with reports by some chinese doctors who self-administered hiv drugs after testing positive for the new coronavirus, but there is as yet no clinical evidence to support the theory.   there is also hope that the link to the furin enzyme could shed light on the virus' evolutionary history before it made the jump to humans.   the mutation, which professor ruan's team described as an \"unexpected insertion\", could come from many possible sources such as a coronavirus found in rats or even a species of avian flu. south china morning post ", "label": 1}, {"content": "china: covid-19 not as

holders\u00a0with a travel history to these places within the last 14 days will be issued with a stay-home notice. long-term pass holders include\u00a0those holding work passes, student\u2019s passes, dependant\u2019s and long-term visit passes.   the stay-home notice compels them to not\u00a0leave home\u00a0for a 14-day\u00a0period after their return to singapore.\u00a0   correspondingly, the ministry of manpower (mom) said on tuesday it will require all work pass holders \u2014 regardless of their nationality and including dependants \u2014 with travel history to these places within the last 14 days and planning to enter or return to singapore, to obtain the ministry\u2019s approval before they commence their journey.\u00a0   the requirement applies to existing work pass holders currently out of singapore, and in-principle approval holders who have yet to enter singapore.\u00a0   in addition, the immigration and checkpoints authority (ica) will not issue all forms of new visas to those with iranian passports with immediate effect, moh said.   those holding iranian passports who were also issued short-term and multiple-visit visas will have these visas suspended and will not be allowed to enter singapore.   singaporeans are\u00a0advised to defer non-essential travel to japan, iran, northern italy and south korea.   the expanded travel restrictions add to the restrictions already imposed on travellers from mainland china, and come as iran, italy and south korea face mounting covid-19 crises.   as of noon on \nmarch 3, there were 90,689 confirmed cases of covid-19 globally, including 10,538 cases outside of china. south korea has reported 4,812 confirmed cases so far. italy has 1,835 cases, while iran has 1,501.   japan, which is not affected by the enhanced travel measures, has confirmed 268 cases so far, moh said.   national development minister lawrence wong, who chairs the multi-ministry taskforce for covid-19, said that japan is not included in the incoming restrictions because\u00a0its number of confirmed cases is lower than the\u00a0other countries at this stage.   \u201cfor japan, we are managing the risk by having an advisory on outgoing trips at this juncture,\u201d mr wong told reporters on tuesday.   moh said that\u00a0the extra precautions will help reduce the risk of imported cases, but the coronavirus is still spreading quickly around the world.   \u201cin the days ahead, it is likely that we will see a surge of infected cases in countries around the world, including in america, europe, the middle east and the rest of asia. singapore is a small, globally connected city-state and we are faced with a higher risk of imported cases,\u201d it said in its statement.   \u201cthere are likely to be many undetected cases in countries that are not undertaking proactive testing,\u201d it added,\u00a0without naming any countries.   \u201cincreasingly, it will not be possible to stop the virus at our borders. we also cannot isolate singapore and shut ourselves from the world. despite our best efforts, we have to be prepared for new spikes in covid-19 cases in singapore, as has happened elsewhere.\u201d\u00a0   mr wong explained that border control measures are still useful at this stage\u00a0\u201cbecause we can still identify where the sources of risks are and then we can take appropriate measures to reduce the risk\u201d of imported cases of\u00a0covid-19.   \u201cby doing so, we (can) flatten the epidemic curve in singapore. we buy ourselves time and we avoid a situation where our hospitals get overwhelmed by a sudden surge of cases,\u201d he said.   however, \nsingapore may come to a point where travel restrictions and border controls alone will no longer be enough\u00a0once the coronavirus spreads to nearby countries, he added.   \u201cit will depend on how widely the virus spreads in other countries. it's our assessment of how endemic it becomes around the world. and at that juncture, i think some of these restrictions may become less relevant,\u201d mr wong said.   urging singaporeans to continue practising good personal hygiene, moh said that it will redouble its efforts and continue put resources into detecting and isolating covid-19 cases as well as close contacts to \u201cbreak the chain of infection\u201d.   moh said that singaporeans should adopt the following practices:   stay\u00a0home when unwell, including during the period covered by medical certificates   wash\u00a0hands regularly with soap and water, and not touching the face unnecessarily   clean\u00a0up after themselves at hawker centres and not sharing utensils.   \u201cthese need to be a part of our daily life permanently. such habits will enable us to resist infections like covid-19, while going about our daily lives normally as much as possible,\u201d the ministry said.

According to Molina, man is 57 years old and traveled to the Asian country on December 25, returning to Mexico on January 10.

In addition, an alert protocol will be issued in both hospitals and aerodromes to detect symptoms such as fever or respiratory difficulty. The border with the United States will be another of the special points of care because, according to L\u00f3pez Gatell, there is a huge Asian community, especially in California.

For Matthias Dueburg everything went as always: The trade fair stands of his clients were finished produced, the assembly teams booked, the cars rented, hotel room reserved. But then the fair in Cologne said the hardware fair and shifted her to spring 2021. Because of the \"worldwide location around the occurrence of the coronavirus\". One third of the approximately 3,000 exhibitors was from China, where the Coronaepidemistry took its exit. Three of them were clients of ZENIT trade fair construction, Dueburg's company. The cancellation in Cologne is far from the only one. The Frankfurt Messe failed the building technology exhibition Light + Building for the same reason and relocated them to September. In Augsburg, Dueburg's people were stopped in the middle of the construction of stalls for a meeting of an electric body, because the organizer desired the fair. The Geneva Motor Show could not take place, it says from industry circles. The coronavirus becomes a risk for many companies, especially the middle class could arise millions of damage. The scope of the orders alone for the hardware fair \"is in the six-digit area,\" says Denneburg. A booth is today a high-tech building made of high-quality materials with ceiling installations, LED walls, screens, VR installations. The company from Cologne now tries to limit the damage: \"What we could stop, we have stopped.\" Whoever has to wear which costs now, he just clares with the clients. Similarly, Ute Yiannakis, managing director of the trade fair outfitter profile & design from Bad Honnef. With her are finished exhibition stands in stock - for the 200 Chinese exhibitors on the Frankfurt fair Light + Building, as she says. An order volume of almost 180,000 euros. The exhibition has been canceled since Monday. The industry is heavily unsettled. The effects of corona crisis on trade fair construction companies, trade fair organizers and event agencies \nBe \"already dramatic,\" says Jan veal, managing director of the industry association Famab, which sees his member companies in front of heavy times. \"The international trade fair is created, the higher the probability that it is canceled,\" he says. There is currently no compelling reason for this. \"According to the Ministry of Health and Robert Koch Institute, we currently have a low to moderate hazard,\" says veal and complains: \"Currently the border is exceeded to hysteria. We hope for a reunion of reason.\" In Frankfurt, the Light + Building failed at the official documents. The exhibitors from China should be completely interviewed and medically tested several times. \"The health department requested us a multi-level health examination that could not be realized by the fair,\" says MessesPreuer Markus Quint. The authority did not deny any cancellation, the fair had determined itself. Such decisions also contributes to the risk that rows of exhibitors could share - the fair is thus losing attractiveness. In this way, the Mobile Fair Barcelona had recently shrunk until the organizer abducts them for lack of mass. One of the largest industry shows in Germany is currently resisting the virus. The International Tourism Exchange Berlin should open on Wednesday - was today. On Friday, however, the crisis staff of the Federal Government wants to advise on the ITB and weigh health against economic interests. Approximately 400 exhibitors from Italy - the current Corona main risk of risk of Europe would have already been canceled, states from the trade fair management, which also refers to that only 16 of the 10,000 exhibitors from Chinese mainland. The tourism fair wants to be equipped against the virus: There should be dispensers for disinfectants at all inputs and outputs, notices should indicate protective measures that \nCleaning intervals of the sanitary facilities are increased. All exhibitors, trade visitors and journalists must explain in writing before the admission, whether they were in the past two weeks - the incubation period of the virus - in Corona risk regions or whether they had contact with such people. But all this remains an attempt to minimize the risk of infection, because the truthless information on the questionnaires can not force the fair. \"We do not assume that visitors do false information,\" says Messesprecherin Britta Wolters. \"We appeal to healthy sense and responsibility of all.\" The information force is only temporary here: on 7 and 8 March, if the fair opens for private visitors, these controls should fall away - so it is planned at least so far. Already at the leading trade fair for the fruit and vegetable trade in February, the Fruit Logistica, according to Berliner Messe, there was such protective measures. Here half of the Chinese manufacturers said. After the large tourism fair ITB, smaller events will follow in Berlin, the next fair is at the end of April. Then comes the aviation exhibition ILA. With the ITB comparable major events there will be back from September. Positive for exhibitors and exhibitors could be that the trade fair centers later have free periods of time in the year, in which they can now lay out daily events. \"It's reasonably good that the hardware fair takes place next year,\" says the Cologne Messebauer Dueburg, \"then the turnover shifts only.\" Ute Yiannakis from the company from Bad Honnef was contractually secured against economic damage: \"We demand 50 percent of the order amount for a month before the beginning of the fair.\" Thus, after all, the costs of preparations are covered. But moving has boundaries, as Harald K\u00f6tter says from the association of the trade fair organizers: \"This is not a simple process that must have dates \nbe coordinated with the industry. \"The Toys Fair Nuremberg at the end of January is aware of the beginning of January, because it is geared to the Christmas business. An appointment in the second half of the year would be too late to acquire the desired major orders. Similarly, it looks for the a few days ago Winter sports fair ISPO, it is geared to the season of the following year. \"In the course of fairs, buyers awarded great orders,\" says K\u00f6tter. \"Therefore, it is important to keep these time windows as possible, especially in the consumer goods area.\" Good possible to the Coronavirus attracts one or the other legal dispute. Exhibitors could accuse damages in trade fair companies. Although trade fair companies are based on the recommendations and requirements of the health authorities and domestic doctors. Whether they cancel a trade fair, they decide themselves. The Messe Frankfurt, which the Light + Building Because of the high official requirements, still looks at D He's secure side. \"We assume force majeure, as the fulfillment of the conditions would have meant a disproportionate effort,\" says the MessesPreuer Quint.

public over the strength of the novel coronavirus which has sickened more than 31,200 people across the country. \n speaking at a press conference in beijing, dr wang guoqiang, an infectious disease expert at peking university no 1 hospital, said that preliminary data about people who had recovered after being infected was promising. \n based on a small sample of discharged patients from wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak, dr wang said that about 6 per cent had recovered after being in a serious condition, while less than one per cent had recovered after being classed as in critical condition. \n \u201cthis shows that cases in serious and critical conditions can be treated and discharged from hospital after receiving proactive treatment, and that has given us great confidence,\u201d he said. \n \u201cwe now have expert teams supporting wuhan, especially those who have been transferred from intensive care units. \n \u201ci think this will greatly reduce the mortality of patients in critical condition and improve the recovery rate,\u201d he said. \n ms guo yanhong, a senior inspector with the national health commission, said at the briefing that the addition of \u201cmedical shelters\u201d in wuhan \u2014 which will provide 4,600 beds once completed \u2014 would greatly help in the treatment of patients with mild symptoms, and prevent them from developing complications and aggravating their illness. \n \u201cour capacity to treat patients is significantly boosted by these medical shelters\u2026 enabling us to lower infections,\u201d she said. \n dr wang said the new shelters would \u201cenable us to segregate the patients, ensure they are properly isolated and hence preventing infection, and also allow us to better identify patients who may have the risk of becoming critically ill\u201d. \n the new coronavirus, which was first reported in wuhan in december, has killed 638 people \u2014 all but two of them in mainland china \u2014

seasonal influenza,\u201d he said referring to severe acute respiratory syndrome, which killed about 800 people around the world in 2002-03. \n but dr oshitani called on china to make more real-time data available. \n \u201cfor example, we want to know what is happening in major cities such as chongqing. this is critically important in predicting what is going to happen in other cities such as tokyo,\u201d he said. \n as well as figures for confirmed cases, those in serious condition and discharged, dr oshitani said it would be useful to have data on how many patients had been infected because of local transmission or were imported cases from wuhan as that would hold the key to determining whether the spread of the virus was controllable. \n \u201cif most of them are still imported cases from wuhan, they may be able to control the situation. if there is a widespread local transmission, it is totally different,\u201d he said. \n the most recent figures, released on tuesday,

pathogenicity, the percentage of those who develop severe disease among the infected, and mortality may not be precise. \n \u201ci think many epidemiologists suspect the estimates for 2019-ncov disease severity are a bit exaggerated,\u201d he said, using the official name of the virus. \n \u201cmetrics like pathogenicity and mortality are falsely elevated because infected people with few or no symptoms are not being counted in the denominators.\u201d \n but dr gray also acknowledged that there were people in china suspected of contracting the coronavirus but who had not been tested. they would not be counted in the statistics, which further complicated the assessment of the disease, he said. south china morning post ", "label": 0}, {"content": "what you need to know about the coronavirus. a viruses are microscopic biological parasites that lack the ability to survive and reproduce outside living organisms, which include animals, humans and even bacteria.   they become active only when they come into contact with living cells, which they then try to hijack to produce more viruses.   a they belong to a large group of viruses that usually infect only animals, and are so named for the crown-like spikes on their surface.   scientists have identified coronaviruses that affect humans, with seven types of these viruses classified to date.   four of these typically cause mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illnesses such as the common cold. but the remaining three have more severe repercussions on human health.   the first is the sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus, which killed almost 800 people in 32 countries 17 years ago.   the other two are mers-cov (middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus), which was first reported in saudi arabia in 2012 and later spread farther, and 2019-ncov (wuhan virus), which killed its first victims in the chinese city of wuhan.   a scientists speculate that the wuhan virus, like the mers and sars viruses, evolved from coronavirus strains that previously affected only animals.   coronaviruses generally have a single strand of genetic material called rna, which is more easily copied or mutated than humans' double-stranded dna, and this accounts for their virality.   the wuhan virus has been closely linked to huanan seafood market in wuhan, which reportedly also peddled live animals like deer and animal parts, in addition to seafood.   scientists said that such unnatural situations, where animals are brought together and often housed in poor conditions in close proximity to people, create opportunities for a virus to hop between animals. the virus could then have mutated so that it is able to infect humans, and eventually start spreading among people.   every \nvirus typically infects a certain type of living host organism, said dr sebastian maurer-stroh, deputy executive director of research at the agency for science, technology and research's (a*star) bioinformatics institute. \"viruses can shift their host preference through mutations... some viruses mutate much faster.\"   a the wuhan coronavirus is understood to spread much like the common flu does - through the air when an infected person coughs, through close contact such as shaking hands with an infected person, or touching an object which has the virus on it before touching one's mouth and eyes.   for now, virologists say the wuhan coronavirus is likely not as infectious as the sars virus. but there are concerns that the wuhan virus' current reported 2 per cent death rate - where two out of 100 infected people die - is not representative, and that the virus could further mutate to become more lethal.   there are worries that the number of infections is under-reported, with many brushing off symptoms as those of the common flu.   a it is a different strain and, for now, has reported a lower fatality rate than the sars virus.   the world health organisation estimates the overall fatality rate for sars patients to be between 14 per cent and 15 per cent, while that for wuhan is currently at 2 per cent.   researchers have said that the wuhan virus shares only 76 per cent of its genetic material with the sars virus - a big difference in genetic terms, much like \"comparing a dog and a cat\".   there is, however, speculation that both viruses originated from bats. recent reports have also suggested that the wuhan virus might be linked to snakes too.   a no, said professor paul tambyah of the department of medicine at the national university of singapore's yong loo lin school of medicine.   instead, we should be concerned.   he said there are measures in place to control the outbreak here and elsewhere. the public should be concerned and thus be vigilant about maintaining \ngood hand hygiene, seeking medical attention if unwell and staying home, he said.   a wear a surgical mask when you have a cold or flu.   some doctors have been wearing surgical masks as a precautionary measure at work, so some people have wondered if they should dig out their n95 masks too.   but there is no need to, said professor leo yee sin, executive director of the national centre for infectious diseases. instead, they should wear surgical ones.   \"n95 masks are... very difficult to breathe in. if you find the n95 mask easy to breathe in and comfortable, you are wearing it wrongly and it is no use,\" she said, adding that these masks are not recommended for the public.   dr leong hoe nam, an infectious disease specialist at mount elizabeth novena hospital, said everyone with respiratory symptoms must wear masks, now that there is human-to-human transmission for the wuhan virus.   a the ministry of health (moh) on thursday said singaporeans should avoid travelling to wuhan, stepping up a notch from its advice on wednesday for people to\u00a0defer non-essential travel there.   the ministry said it updated the travel advisory \"in view of the\u00a0developing novel coronavirus\u00a0situation in wuhan and other parts of china\", with confirmed cases spreading beyond wuhan to beijing, shanghai, tianjin and guangdong, which abuts densely populated hong kong.   it also cited the travel halt imposed by the chinese authorities on thursday, as all flights out of the city were cancelled and trains, buses and ferries suspended.   the ministry\u00a0also reminded the public to continue to exercise caution and pay attention to personal hygiene when travelling to the rest of china.   moh said all travellers should monitor their health closely for two weeks upon return to singapore and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell, and also inform their doctor of their travel history.   if they have a fever or respiratory symptoms such as a cough or runny nose, they should wear a mask and call \nthe clinic ahead of the visit.   a singapore is stepping up precautionary measures in anticipation of more travellers in the lead-up to the chinese new year holidays.   the expanded measures include temperature screening for all travellers arriving from china - not just wuhan alone - at changi airport from yesterday, and issuing health advisory notices to them.   a a flu vaccine will not help protect you against the wuhan coronavirus. there is no vaccine to protect against coronaviruses.   however, according to an advisory from raffles medical, you should still get a flu jab if you are travelling to places where there are suspected cases to prevent you from contracting influenza symptoms that may mislead the screening authorities at temperature checkpoints.   there is also no specific treatment to cure illnesses caused by human coronaviruses, including pneumonia caused by the wuhan virus.   patients typically recover on their own after some time.

none of the 238 displayed any symptoms for respiratory disease and therefore required no laboratory tests, even though asymptomatic transmissions have been documented elsewhere.   it was difficult to avoid the impression that jakarta was burying its head in the sand.\u00a0\u00a0   even after the formal confirmation of covid-19 infections, jakarta seemed reluctant to roll out comprehensive measures to curb the outbreak.   it is also worth noting that the two infected individuals were tested after alerting the authorities themselves.   the mother and daughter from depok had gone to a hospital themselves after falling ill. the hospital misdiagnosed the daughter with bronchitis and the mother with typhus.   the daughter, a professional dancer by the name of sita, then learnt that a female japanese tourist who had been at an event she had hosted was diagnosed with the virus in malaysia.   ms sita informed the hospital this and asked to be tested for covid-19. to her horror, however, she learned about her positive status not from the hospital but on television when she saw a press conference by mr widodo.   a leak of their personal details alleged by someone in the government then led to the pair being trolled online, with fake news being circulated that the tourist was a man and ms sita had \u201cdanced with him in a nightclub\u201d.   many indonesian social media users even professed having no sympathy for ms sita because she had been infected \u201cby behaving loosely\u201d.   the public hounding of indonesia\u2019s first two covid-19 victims may have the undesirable effect of dissuading more indonesians with symptoms from coming forward, knowing they may be stigmatised when they \nare found to be infected.\u00a0   it certainly does not help when the religious establishment, represented by the indonesian council of ulema, also supports the idea that there is something un-islamic about being infected with covid-19.   in a press release on march 3, the government-funded body claimed that as long as indonesian muslims do not eat anything \u201charam\u201d or unclean according to the quran, they are safe from covid-19.   it said the virus is \u201ca rebuke from allah\u201d for those who eat \u201cunclean food, such as pork, human blood or live animals, which always bring diseases\u201d.   given that vice president ma\u2019ruf amin is also the outfit\u2019s chairman, its statement is likely to have been sanctioned by the government.   days before the statement, mr amin himself had reiterated the view that indonesia\u2019s \u201czero-infection\u201d status was due to divine protection. \u201cmany clerics recite the qunut (dawn prayer), including myself, which is why the coronavirus is banished from indonesia,\u201d he said.   the haphazard way in which the indonesian government has reacted to the covid-19 outbreak underscores its fear that it will trigger mass hysteria among indonesians as well as of the negative economic repercussions.   this would explain why, even after the confirmation of infections on march 2, mr widodo still boasted that indonesia is somehow benefitting from the outbreak.   on one occasion, he professed himself \u201cpleased\u201d that, thanks to the epidemic, optimism for doing business in indonesia rose to above 50 per cent while that for china fell to 35.\u00a0\u00a0   in reality, the country\u2019s public health system is ill-prepared to deal with a full-blown crisis.   to date, only hospitals and health institutions in jakarta and surabaya are capable of testing for covid-19 with accuracy. bali, indonesia\u2019s top tourist destination, has no laboratory which can identify the virus.   indonesia\u2019s hospital bed to population ratio is also low at 12 per 10,000, half that of singapore while there are only 3.9 doctors for \nevery 10,000 indonesians. the fact it is also an archipelago of 18,000 islands makes any containment effort challenging.   on march 6, the indonesian government confirmed two more covid-19 cases, after tracing 20 people who interacted with the first two cases.\u00a0\u00a0   while this signals a greater degree of realism and action, jakarta should have been more transparent with the public from the beginning, instead of trying to play down the threat covid-19 posed.   in this internet age where indonesians can access information readily, running a narrative which was at odds with the rest of the world only resulted in diminished public trust in the government.   evidently, indonesia did not learn much from how it handled the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) pandemic in 2003.   although jakarta set up an emergency fund worth tens of millions of dollars to contain the outbreak, as well as forcibly quarantined individuals suspected of having contracted sars, it was never transparent about how many indonesians were infected.\u00a0   the lack of credible data even gave rise to the belief that sars somehow passed indonesia by.   we appear to be seeing a repeat of this now with the covid-19 outbreak. it is not too late for the jokowi administration to restore public trust in its ability to contain the virus.   the central government must also ensure that its steps are in tandem with its counterparts on the regional levels. at the moment, a serious lack of coordination exists.   jakarta governor anies baswedan for example has ruffled some feathers by declaring a state of emergency in the capital city, though no comprehensive measures have been rolled out.   coordinating minister for politics, law and security mahfud md, without mentioning names, has warned regional leaders against using the outbreak to score political points.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   time is of the essence here and indonesia should act now, especially as the country confirmed two more cases on march 8 and can expect more infections in \nthe days ahead.\u00a0   \u00a0   about the author:   johannes nugroho is a

The 'fault' was an unexpected sanitary crisis, a 'black swan' arising in China with Wuhan coronavirus that became a global emergency.

After world-scale scholarships have registered an annual gain of 29% in 2019, in full euphoria, the global fellow index lost 1% in January, with a more marked drop of 2.5% in the last week of the month.

Bill Bishop, Editor of Sinocism Newsletter predicts that even in an optimistic scenario, the 'normal' in the Chinese economy and in its relations with the world should not return before April. Although the World Health Organization has given China's confidence in combating coronavirus, the risk of spreading a quarantine climate of China itself by increasing number of countries will aggravate the nervousness of markets. The contagion of the negative effects in China in the first quarter of the year - where the Quarantine Provinces and Metropolis represent 50% of Chinese GDP - can spread not only asian neighbors as to other more dependent economies in the Chinese market. The main negative impact was recorded in the scholarships of emerging economies, whose overall index fell 4.7% in January, with emphasis on the sinking of the \nIndices in Hungary, South Africa, Philippines, Thailand, Chile, Brazil and Poland, with falls above 5%.

", "label": 1}, {"content": "from food to tech, coronavirus to spur urban planning rethink. bangkok \u2014 the coronavirus pandemic sweeping across the planet will force city authorities and planners to more seriously consider factors such as population density, technology, food security and inadequate housing, urban experts said.   in response to the rising number of infections, countries have tightened border controls, imposed travel bans, locked down cities and stepped up surveillance using technology powered by artificial intelligence (ai).   \"it is likely that covid-19 will prompt a rethink of urban design and planning in the asia-pacific region,\" said dr tony matthews, a senior lecturer in urban and environmental planning at australia's griffith university.   \"there will probably be consideration of desirable population density levels, a greater utilisation of apps and smart data to track health trends, and many cities will probably start to think about their food security more closely,\" he said.   countries including china, south korea and singapore are using robots, drones and big data to track the outbreak, disinfect hospitals and deliver supplies.   such technologies may become a fixture in cities to flag potential problems for quicker response, said dr matthews.   authorities are also likely to more closely monitor vector-borne diseases such as dengue fever that are shifting due to climate change, and impose limits on the types and numbers of live animals in traditional markets, he said.   coronaviruses are zoonotic diseases \u2014 meaning they are passed from animals to humans \u2014 and the rapid pace of deforestation and urbanisation are major factors in the spread of these diseases in asia, health experts say.   authorities in china said they would tighten supervision of traditional markets in the cities.   catalysts   this would not be the first time that an epidemic has led to changes in city planning, research shows.   the cholera outbreaks of the 1830s led to better sanitation in london and \nelsewhere, while the tuberculosis epidemic in new york in the early 20th century paved the way for improved public transit systems and housing regulations.   the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) outbreak in 2003, which hit cities such as hong kong and singapore, led singapore to upgrade its medical infrastructure and create systems to map the disease.   \"historically, epidemics have acted as catalysts in transforming how diseases are handled, especially in urban areas,\" said dr annie wilkinson, a research fellow at the institute of development studies, a uk-based think tank.   \"community engagement is key to effective epidemic control, be it delivering trusted messages, carrying out surveillance, or limiting movement,\" she said.   in singapore, which has among the fastest ageing populations in the world, engaging with older people was key as the coronavirus has a higher mortality rate among seniors.   singapore's ministry of health worked with community partners to ensure that essential services such as home-based care and transportation continued to reach seniors, a spokeswoman for the ministry said.   more than 500 volunteers aim to visit about 27,000 seniors to keep them updated on the outbreak and address concerns, she said. other service providers delivered meals and offered counselling.   such decentralisation of services may become more common in cities, said dr creighton connolly, a senior lecturer at the university of lincoln in england.   \"decentralisation of services and reducing density are ways to combat disease spread, though this is contrary to sustainable transport and climate-change related goals,\" he said.   \"also, very dense cities like hong kong and singapore have contained the virus better than largely rural areas like lombardy and veneto in italy. ultimately, governance dimensions are more important than planning or design approaches,\" he said.   food security   more than two-thirds of the global population is forecast to live in urban \nareas by 2050 \u2014 up from 56 per cent today, according to the united nations.   with cities battling worsening climate-change effects, planners also have to balance competing demands for land.   china hurriedly built 16 makeshift hospitals in wuhan, the city at the centre of the coronavirus epidemic, to handle the load.   in hong kong, some public housing blocks were requisitioned for quarantine facilities, while in italy authorities in genoa are converting a ferry to a hospital boat.   \"planners may consider leaving small parcels of strategic urban land available, in case temporary medical facilities or housing need to be set up,\" said dr matthews.   alongside, authorities will also need to consider the issue of food security amidst lockdowns and closed borders, he said.   \"food security is a huge issue because cities don't tend to produce their food,\" he said.   singapore, which imports more than 90 per cent of its food, is encouraging more local production, for example.   some cities may create stockpiles, while others may try to produce more food locally through urban farming or through intensive growing facilities using hydroponics, dr matthews said.   \"but the bottom line is most cities rely on global supply lines for food and are therefore vulnerable to disruptions.\"   perhaps more importantly, planners will have to consider the impact of widening wealth inequality, with millions of homeless people and those living in slums at greater risk of contracting disease, said dr wilkinson.   \"achieving longer-term changes in urban planning will depend on improving the way we see, understand and address health and living conditions in informal settlements,\" she said.   \"for many people living on the margins, crisis is already the norm and change is overdue.\" reuters ", "label": 1}, {"content": "Denunciation of smaller Portuguese

i\u2019ve yet to be served white rice,\u201d she said, laughing.   after lunch, ms qu would pass her time watching drama serials on her mobile phone or exercising.   a time to reflect   on her experience so far, ms qu struck a positive note, saying that it had been an opportunity for her to pause and reflect.   \u201ci think about how i should spend time with my children as a mother. sometimes i lose my temper at them, but i really miss them,\u201d she \nsaid.   with taiwan having barred chinese nationals from entering the territory indefinitely, it is likely to be a while before ms qu is reunited with her husband and children.   speaking to today over the phone from taiwan, mr bushfield said that his quarantine experience had also been positive, with his daily routine revolved around keeping his two children entertained.   \u201cwe knew we would be quarantined so we were very prepared. we made sure we had a lot of toys and colouring books to occupy the kids,\u201d said the 54-year-old east asia area service manager for danish pump manufacturer grundfos.    mr faisal bushfield\u2019s 6-year-old daughter ariane and 5-year-old son arden doing colouring activities during their quarantine at civil service club loyang\u2019s chalet. photo: mr faisal bushfield   unlike his wife who was confined to a room, mr bushfield and his children were allocated an entire chalet unit.   mr bushfield said he tried to maintain a semblance of normalcy for his children, and got them to engage in activities that they usually do at home, such as making their own beds.   \u201cwe told the kids to see it as an adventure and not as a quarantine. we wanted it to be an opportunity for them to spend time with me.\u201d   when their quarantine period ended, they were just happy to be outdoors. mr bushfield immediately booked his family into a hotel where they went for a swim, and took them to pasir ris park the next day where they spoke to their mother over the phone, while watching her in her chalet from a distance.   living separately, under the same roof   like ms qu and mr bushfield, another couple also found themselves living separately during their quarantine period, albeit under the same roof.   a staff member from grace assembly of god, the church with the largest cluster of confirmed cases here, said that he had to keep a distance from his wife. he had been quarantined, while his wife had to serve a leave of absence.   unlike those under quarantine who are legally \nbound to remain in isolation, those serving a leave of absence may go out briefly to attend to matters.   the church employee, who declined to be named, said that he was first contacted by a ministry of health (moh) official as part of the ministry\u2019s contact-tracing process.   an officer then paid a visit to his house, where they recorded his temperature and took down details of his household before explaining the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of being under quarantine.   he was required to record his temperature three times a day. an officer from moh would also call daily to check on his health, typically after the timings when he was expected to take his temperature.   the church staff member also said that living apart from his wife while under the same roof was a \u201cunique\u201d experience.   typical family routines had to be changed. for instance, he and his wife had to sleep in separate bedrooms and use different toilets.   \u201ci imagine the quarantine process to be a lot more challenging if both husband and wife were issued with a quarantine order, for those with immobile parents to look after, or those living alone,\u201d he said.

  coronaviruses are named for the spikes that protrude from their membranes, which resemble a crown or the sun\u2019s corona. they can infect both animals and people, and can cause illnesses of the respiratory tract. the infections can range from the common cold to dangerous conditions like severe acute respiratory syndrome, or sars, which sickened thousands of people around the world \u2014 and killed nearly 800 \u2014 during an outbreak in 2003. middle east respiratory syndrome, or mers, first reported in saudi arabia in 2012, is also caused by a coronavirus.   how dangerous is it?   it is hard to accurately assess the lethality of a new virus, and some scientists said initially that the new virus appeared to be less severe than other coronaviruses, like sars or mers.   but recent news reports indicate the chinese authorities muzzled doctors who were first to recognise the new infection, and they may not have been fully transparent about the number of infections and deaths even after the alarm was raised.   it is also not clear whether cases and deaths in china are being carefully tracked and reported. \ndiagnostic kits and other health resources have been in short supply in the affected regions.   last week, the who said that while the majority of patients with the new coronavirus have mild disease, 20 per cent develop severe illness, including pneumonia, respiratory failure and sometimes death.   the who estimated the death rate among those infected at 2 per cent. that\u2019s as high as the death rate of the pandemic spanish flu in 1918.   scientists don\u2019t know who is most susceptible to the new coronavirus. does it pose a risk to young healthy people? or, like seasonal flu, is it primarily a threat to the frail and elderly, and those with underlying health problems?   \u201cwhenever a new virus comes out, it takes a while to learn about it,\u201d said dr julie vaishampayan, chairwoman of the public health committee of the infectious diseases society of america. right now, she said, \u201cthe information about coronavirus is changing rapidly.\u201d   how many people have been infected, and how many have died?   at least 17,000 people are known to have been infected, and at least 360 have died. most of the infected lived in wuhan or had recently travelled there.   epidemics caused by other members of the coronavirus family, sars and mers, have had high death rates: 10 per cent for sars, and about 35 per cent for mers.   influenza kills more people every year, but its mortality rate is only about 0.1 per cent. the number of deaths is high because so many people become infected.   widespread coronavirus epidemics have the potential to take a heavy toll, so the health authorities scramble to stamp them out.   a major concern is that with both sars and mers, a few patients inexplicably became \u201csuperspreaders\u201d who infected huge numbers of people.   health care workers are particularly vulnerable. at a hospital in seoul, south korea, in 2015, one man with mers transmitted it to 82 patients.   how is it transmitted?   most respiratory viruses are transmitted through coughing and sneezing, but \ntroubling new evidence suggests people who are infected with the new virus may be spreading it before they even know that they have any symptoms.   though chinese authorities played down the likelihood of human-to-human transmission at first, it has now become clear there is significant and sustained transmission from person to person.   in germany, a 35-year-old businessman was infected by a colleague visiting from shanghai. she was healthy during her trip to germany, and only fell ill during her flight home. three other employees of the man\u2019s company were also infected; two of them had had no contact with the visitor.   that\u2019s \u201cbad news\u201d, said dr william schaffner, an expert in infectious diseases at vanderbilt university medical center.   when people don\u2019t know they are infected, \u201cthey\u2019re up and about, going to work or the gym or to religious services, and breathing on or near other people\u201d, dr schaffner said.   \u201cobviously sick people constrain themselves, and you have fewer opportunities for the virus to spread from one person to another.\u201d   where did the new coronavirus outbreak start?   on jan 8, the new york times reported that chinese researchers had identified a new coronavirus as the pathogen behind a mysterious illness that had sickened 59 people in wuhan.   the cases were linked to a market that sold live fish, animals and birds. the market was later shut down and disinfected.   past outbreaks of similar illnesses, including sars, also are believed to have emerged from live animal markets. the coronavirus that causes mers is transmitted to humans by camels.   the animal that was the source of the new coronavirus is still not known, and the destruction of the wuhan meat market has made the question nearly impossible to investigate.   bats are considered a possible source, because they have evolved to coexist with many viruses, including coronaviruses. but it\u2019s very possible the virus was transmitted from bats to an intermediate animal, and then to humans. \nwhat symptoms should i look out for?   symptoms of this virus include fever, severe cough and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. the illness causes lung lesions and pneumonia. milder cases may resemble the flu or a bad cold, making detection difficult.   patients may exhibit other symptoms too, such as gastrointestinal problems or diarrhoea. the incubation period \u2014 the time from exposure to the onset of symptoms \u2014 is believed to be anywhere from a few days to two weeks.   if you have a fever or cough and recently visited china, or spent time with someone who did, see your health care provider. call first, so they can prepare for your visit and take steps to protect other patients and staff from potential exposure.   is there a test for the virus? what is the treatment?   there is a diagnostic test that can tell if you are infected. it was developed by the centers for disease control and prevention, based on genetic information about the virus provided by chinese authorities.   right now tests are done by the cdc in atlanta, but the agency plans to share the test with states and laboratories as soon as it is refined.   the main treatment for coronavirus is supportive care, including making sure the patient is getting enough oxygen, and using a ventilator to push air into the lungs if necessary, dr vaishampayan said. patients should rest and drink plenty of fluids \u201cwhile the immune system does its job and heals itself,\u201d she said.   no drugs have been approved for any coronavirus diseases, including the novel coronavirus, though an antiviral medication called remdesivir appears to be effective in animals and was used to treat a patient in washington state.   chinese officials are also experimenting with at least one other hiv drug to treat the infection.   how long will it take to develop a vaccine?   a coronavirus vaccine is still months away \u2014 and perhaps years. while new technology, advancements in genomics and improved global coordination have allowed \nresearchers to move at unprecedented speed, vaccine development remains an expensive and risky process.   with each new outbreak, scientists typically have to start from scratch. after the sars outbreak in 2003, it took researchers about 20 months to get a vaccine ready for human trials. (the vaccine was never needed, because the disease was eventually contained.)   by the time of the zika outbreak in 2015, researchers had brought the vaccine development timeline down to six months.   now, they hope that work from past outbreaks will help cut the timeline further. scientists at the national institutes of health and several companies are working on vaccine candidates.   dr anthony fauci, director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, said a preliminary clinical trial may get off the ground in as little as three months. but researchers would still need to conduct extensive testing to prove a vaccine is safe and effective.   even under the best circumstances, it could take at least a year \u2014 maybe longer \u2014 for a vaccine to be available.   should i wear a surgical mask to protect myself?   if you have a respiratory infection, wearing a mask helps protect the people around you from illness by reducing the risk that you will spread the infection. and wearing a surgical mask may somewhat protect you from infection in a crowd if there is an outbreak.   but, generally, surgical masks are not closefitting enough to filter all the air you are breathing in and n95 respirators are extremely uncomfortable.   experts recommend washing your hands frequently throughout the day. avoid touching your face, and maintain a distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.   i have a trip planned to china. should i go?   not if you can avoid it. the state department has warned americans not to go to china unless it is absolutely essential.   if travellers must go, the cdc urges enhanced precautions: avoiding contact with anyone who is sick, as well as with animals \nand the markets in which they are sold; and refraining from eating raw or undercooked meats.   anyone who is older or has an underlying health condition, which increases susceptibility to infections, should consult with a health provider before making a trip. access to medical care in china may be difficult, given the outbreak, and federal officials warned that new travel restrictions could be imposed on return, including quarantine.   what are health authorities doing to contain the virus?   china has taken drastic actions to bar people from leaving affected areas, though 5 million people departed wuhan alone before the restrictions went into effect.   residents have been told to wear masks in public to prevent the spread of the disease. two new hospitals for coronavirus patients are being erected; the first opened on monday.   governments around the world have been screening incoming passengers from china for signs of illness, and some have gone further, barring entry to people from china. russia and mongolia have closed most of their borders with china. australia said it will evacuate citizens from wuhan and quarantine them for 14 days on christmas island.   cdc teams are also providing assistance with state health investigations of infections, including contact-tracing, which means making sure anyone who may have been in contact with an infected individual is warned of the exposure and their health is monitored.   the work will enhance the understanding of the virus and how to prevent its spread. cdc teams have also offered to send public health experts to china to help with the investigation and containment efforts. the new york times ", "label": 1}, {"content": "Covid-19. factory with a thousand workers closes in towers vedras by infection focus.

  researchers studied the patient records of 72,314 covid-19 cases in china as of feb 11, including confirmed cases, suspected cases, clinically diagnosed and asymptomatic cases.   the records were retrieved from china\u2019s infectious disease information system, where all cases of covid-19 in china are entered.   here is a breakdown of the cases studied:   44,672 (61.8 per cent) were confirmed cases, 16,186 (22.4 per cent) were suspected cases, 10,567 (14.6 per cent) were clinically diagnosed cases from hubei province only and 889 (1.2 per cent) were asymptomatic cases.   among the confirmed cases, 86.6 per cent were aged between 30 and 79.   80.9 per cent of confirmed cases were considered to have mild symptoms.   the covid-19 virus spread to the rest of mainland china from wuhan in hubei province after december 2019. by feb 11, 1,386 counties across all 31 provinces had been affected.   the epidemic curve, which shows the number of all cases plotted against the dates of the onset of symptoms for the patients, peaked in the period jan 23 to 26 and began to decline in the lead up to feb 11, \nthe most recent date under study.   the study found that covid-19 was more contagious than severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) but had significantly lower fatality rates than those conditions.   how badly have health workers been affected?   a total of 1,716 health workers were infected and five had died as of feb 11.   most of the health workers who were confirmed cases in china were in wuhan, accounting for 64 per cent of all the confirmed cases among health workers in china.   separate to the study, news emerged on wednesday that the director of a hospital in wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, died on tuesday.   earlier this month, wuhan ophthalmologist li wenliang, who alerted authorities to the outbreak but was questioned by police over \u201cspreading rumours\u201d, also died from the disease.   who is most at risk of dying?   the study found that confirmed cases who were older, male and had other pre-existing health conditions had higher fatality rates.   a total of 1,023 patients confirmed to be infected with the virus had died as of feb 11, which translates to a fatality rate of 2.3 per cent.   those aged 80 and older had the highest fatality rate of 14.8 per cent.   by occupation, patients who were retirees had the highest\u00a0fatality rate at about 5 per cent.   patients with no other medical conditions had a low fatality rate of under 1 per cent.   but those with other health conditions had markedly higher fatality rates:   for cardiovascular disease, the fatality rate was 10.5 per cent,   for diabetes, the fatality rate was 7.3 per cent   for chronic respiratory disease, the fatality rate was 6.3 per cent   for hypertension, the fatality rate was 6 per cent   for cancer, the fatality rate was 5.6 per cent      patients from hubei province had a fatality rate of 2.9 per cent, which was more than seven times that of patients in other provinces (0.4 per cent).   in terms of age brackets, 30.2 per cent of deaths were \npatients aged 60 to 69, 30.5 per cent of deaths were\u00a0those aged 70 to 79 and 20.3 per cent were those over 80 \u2014 which means 81 per cent of deaths were those aged 60 and above.   limitations of the study   although a very large number of cases were analysed, the study had some important limitations, according to the paper.   although all cases analysed were diagnosed clinically and investigated by trained epidemiologists, 37 per cent of the cases studied were not confirmed by nucleic acid testing, a type of test used to identify the virus.   this was because the process is slow, labour intensive, and requires specialised equipment and skilled technicians.   some records also had missing data for a few important variables such as wuhan-related exposure, comorbid conditions, and case severity.   the missing data limits the ability to derive conclusions from the dataset, the paper stated.   the study warns of a possible rebound   researchers said that this study shows that the novel coronavirus had spread extremely rapidly despite extreme efforts to contain it.   they said questions remained over the virus including identifying the source of the animal reservoir, how the virus is transmitted and determining how long a patient is infectious.   more research is also needed for effective treatment and prevention methods such as further test, drug, and vaccine developments.   although the epidemic appeared to be in decline in the lead up to feb 11, the international community must prepare for \u201ca possible rebound of the covid-19 epidemic in the coming weeks and months\u201d, as \"huge numbers\" of people return to work and school after the extended chinese new year holiday, the study said.\u00a0   \u201cas an international community, we must all be responsible partners in surveillance, communication, response, research, and implementation of evidence-based public health and clinical practice,\u201d the study added.

According to researchers from the study published in the scientific journal \"Nature Medicine\", the number of confirmed cases is probably much lower than the number of actually infected people due to the limited capacity to perform mass tests, and therefore the real mortality will be lower than official numbers.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) advanced last week that the virus mortality rate is 3.4%, but according to the study, the likelihood of dying after the development of covid-19 symptoms is 1, 4%.\nLooking at the epicenter of the pandemic, the Chinese city of Wuhan, the team of Chinese researchers believes to have developed a better estimate of the new coronavirus lethality, supported by various public and private databases that include indicators such as confirmed cases without marketing Where the outbreak emerged, the confirmed cases of air passengers and the profile of confirmed cases and deaths.\n\"Estimating the real number of cases is a challenge for an overloaded health system, which can not indicate the number of cases for sure,\" writes researchers.

After the increase in the number of patients in China, a first case of the new lung disease has also been demonstrated in the USA. It is a man who had returned to the West Coast metropolis of Seattle after a trip to the Chinese province of Wuhan on January 15, the US health authority CDC announced on Tuesday. The man did not notice any symptoms when returning, but then issue themselves to a hospital for investigation, said it. He is in good condition. There is only a very low risk that he could infect other people. Experts had previously declared that isolated introductions of the new lung disease are becoming more likely even more likely to Europe. It should not be ruled out that a diseased person travel to Germany, Lars Schaade, Vice President of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) in Berlin said. You have to worry in Germany but do not have to do. \"In the coming days, we have to expect more cases in other parts of China and possibly in other countries,\" explained the spokesman for the World Health Organization (WHO), Tarik Ja\u0161arevi\u0107, on Tuesday in Geneva. That is not unusual: \"If you expand monitoring, it is likely that you are discovered more cases.\" The Health Authority of the Central Chinese Metropolis Wuhan reported further dead by the novel coronavirus. Overall, six deaths are now confirmed, mostly they concerned older people with severe pre-existing conditions. In addition, dozens of further infections were reported on Tuesday. This now has more than 300 confirmed cases in China since the beginning of the outbreak in December. Evidence is also available in Taiwan, Thailand, Japan and South Korea - in all cases diseased people who were previously in Wuhan. \"We have to prepare for ourselves in Germany that at least in individual cases, it comes to introductions of the disease,\" said the Berliner \nVirus researchers Christian Road. \"Clinics must then be prepared to isolate the patients.\" The health risk for the population in Germany is currently classified as \"very low\" by the responsible RKI. Although there could be individual cases of imports, continued infection chains - thus subsequent transmissions from man to man - are unlikely to be present, so RKI Vice President Schaade. Even at the Mers-Coronavirus, there were occasional infected in Germany, without it then come to further transfers in Germany. The Federal Ministry of Health also estimates the risk to Germany as low. \"Nevertheless, we observe the situation in China at all attention and are in constant exchange with our international partners,\" said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of Health. With the currently running travel wave to the Chinese New Year next Saturday, the risk of spread the virus is growing. In the two-week holiday season around the festival are a few hundred million Chinese traveling, many families companies also joint travel abroad. In addition to destinations in Southeast Asia, traveling to Europe or the USA are also popular. Asian neighbors and airports in other countries such as the US and Australia have meanwhile introduced fever controls when entering Wuhan. The Italian Ministry of Health announced to review suspected cases on board in Rome-bound planes from Wuhan in the future. Pilots should therefore report passengers with corresponding symptoms. These would then immediately be brought into the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Rome, it said. For the time being, there are no special measures at German airports. However, Frankfurt Airport has made preparations. \"The plan is in the drawer,\" said a spokeswoman for the operator company Fraport on Tuesday. If the health department \nExplour in Frankfurt Replace, these would be implemented. Direct flights from Wuhan to Frankfurt do not give it any. Also, from D\u00fcsseldorf Airport, it was said, so far, the relevant health care authority does not yet take any action required. If there is a suspicion on board a machine direction D\u00fcsseldorf, the pilot would give an indication of the air traffic control or the airport, a spokesman continued to explain. \"The airport would immediately inform the health department and place the corresponding machine later in a separate area.\" From the Robert Koch Institute it was said, there was no scientific evidence of the effectiveness of so-called entry screenings at airports, ie controls on entry. It makes sense, however, exit screenings in a disease wave are particularly affected areas. The 11 million metropolis Wuhan has already introduced corresponding controls upon departure. The World Health Organization (WHO) has convened its emergency committee because of lung disease. The experts should advise on Wednesday. If the WHO exclaims an international health nightstand, she recommends sharply measures to combat the disease. Among other things, border controls and setting up specialized treatment centers can be included. Currently, WHO recommends no travel or trading restrictions. \"On the basis of the existing information, there is no justification for restrictions of travel or trade,\" said the speaker. \"Should the situation escalate, the WHO could comment on the risks of travel in affected areas.\" The EU Commission also plans to make a meeting to assess the risks through the new lung disease. According to a speaker, the Committee on Health Safety should meet on Thursday. Last Friday, there has been an exchange of EU countries, which was advised on possible reactions to the coronavirus.

singapore's economic growth forecast for 2020 amid the covid-19 outbreak, with a possible full-year recession on the cards.   in a press release on monday (feb 17), the mti downgraded its gross domestic product (gdp)\u00a0growth forecast to between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, with overall growth to come in at around 0.5 per cent.   its previous forecast was between 0.5 and 2.5 per cent.   \u201chowever, as the covid-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the singapore economy,\u201d said mr gabriel lim, permanent secretary for the ministry.   the downgraded forecast comes as mti reported a 0.7 per cent expansion in singapore\u2019s economy for the whole of 2019, which is slower than the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018, as declines in the manufacturing sector weighed down the economy. this confirmed the preliminary estimate for 2019 released in january.   on friday, prime minister lee hsien loong said that the economic impact of the covid-19 outbreak was already bigger than in 2003, when singapore was hit with an outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars).   mr lee also said that a recession was possible.   however, ms yong yik wei, director of the economics division at mti, emphasised to reporters during a press conference on monday that the ministry is not projecting a full-year recession for 2020.   the last time singapore registered a full-year contraction of its economy was in 2001 after the dot-com bust, when economic growth declined by 1 per cent. in the dot-com bust, many internet-related stocks, which had soared in value, then crashed as investors were worried that the businesses were not making money.   when singapore was hit by sars in 2003, the ministry said that full-year growth was \n4.5 per cent. the economy shrank 0.3 per cent in the second quarter of that year, which corresponded with the months that sars was battering singapore.   while there was a sharp v-shaped rebound after sars, mr lim said he does not know if this same rebound will happen this time.   trade, geopolitical tensions add to global uncertainties   mti warned that if the covid-19 outbreak is more widespread, severe and protracted than expected, there could be a sharper decline in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production.   trade tensions between the united states and china, as well as geopolitical tensions in the middle east also add to the global uncertainties.   \"against this backdrop, the outlook for the singapore economy has weakened since the last review in november,\" said mti.   the covid-19 outbreak is expected to affect outward-oriented sectors such as manufacturing and wholesale trade due to the weaker growth outlook in several of singapore\u2019s key final demand markets, including china.   in addition, firms in these sectors could be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in china as a result of the measures implemented by the chinese government to contain the outbreak.   the outbreak has also led to a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from china, to singapore. this has badly affected the tourism sector, said mti.   domestic consumption in singapore is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. this will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services.\u00a0   mti also said that the covid-19 outbreak is likely to dampen growth prospects of china and other affected countries in 2020.   in china, growth in gdp for 2020 is expected to come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major chinese \ncities to contain the spread of the virus, said mti.   industrial production has also been disrupted because of work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures.   \"these developments in china will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies, including the association of southeast asian nation (asean) economies, through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from china, as well as disruptions to supply chains,\" read the statement.   other regional economies directly affected by the outbreak, such as japan, thailand and malaysia, may also experience a drop in domestic consumer sentiments, and hence private consumption growth, noted mti.   what economists had said   earlier this month, maybank kim eng and dbs cut their 2020 full-year growth forecasts for singapore\u2019s economy.   maybank kim eng economists chua hak bin and lee ju ye said the bank is slashing its forecast to 1.1 per cent, a sharp drop from 1.8 per cent previously, as border control measures as well as the viral outbreak itself affect the hospitality, travel and retail sectors. likewise, dbs downgraded its forecast to 0.9 per cent from 1.4 per cent previously.   the dbs report by its senior economist irvin seah\u00a0noted that the impact of the sars outbreak was mainly felt in the second quarter of 2003. gdp shrunk by 0.3 per cent year-on-year during the quarter but growth recovered swiftly in the subsequent quarters. overall, singapore managed to post a 4.5 per cent expansion in 2003, due to strong performances from the wholesale and retail trade, and financial services.   ms selena ling, head of treasury research and strategy at ocbc bank, said that the outbreak had caused a \u201ctriple whammy\u201d scenario, with manufacturing and wholesale trade affected due to supply chain disruptions and slower demand from key markets, a sharp falloff in the tourism and transport sectors, as well as declines in domestic spending.   \u201cat this juncture, the uncertainties over the duration and \nextent of the covid-19 outbreak imply it is still too early to call for a recovery in the second half of 2020,\u201d said ms ling.   should the outbreak turn out to be severe, ms ling expects singapore\u2019s economy to not register any growth for 2020.   mr brian tan, economist at barclays bank, said that some weakness will still persist in the second half of 2020, even though the brunt of the impact would likely have subsided by the second quarter of this year.   mr tan expects recession to hit singapore with this outbreak, as he projects the economy to contract by 0.4 per cent for the full year, which is near the bottom end of the mti forecast range.

Just three weeks ago the United States identified the first infected by the Coronavirus in its territory. He was entered at the Everett Regional Medical Center, in Washington. There, to avoid the spread of the virus, every detail account and technology has become a great ally. From the first minute, doctors have communicated with the patient through a robot called Vici that has a screen, speakers and a microphone. The device, which looks like a tablet with wheels and has been developed by the Intouch Health company, also has a phonoscope and allows basic testing as the temperature measurement. Like VICI, there are other machines that may contain the climbing of the coronavirus and help reduce the workload of doctors. For example, Guangdong Provincial Popular Hospital, south of China, has begun to use robots capable of opening and closing doors and pick up the elevator autonomously to deliver medications to patients, according to China CGTN public television \"in this type Situations is essential to avoid contagion and extension. Robots can serve to test citizens, detect possible diseases and prevent other people or medical personnel from being contagious, \"says Ambrosio Rodr\u00edguez G\u00f3mez, member of the colleges of Computer Engineering of Spain and Dean of the Official College of Engineers In Computer Science of Castilla-La Mancha. Everything points to the coronavirus is spread among people who are close through contact and small drops of saliva than the bearer of the virus excreted when coughing. Therefore, minimizing human contact is fundamental. Especially in China, where there are already more than 17,000 affected and the death number exceeds 360. Among the deceased is Liang Wudong, one of the doctors who dealt with patients in \nWuhan, the epicenter of Coronavirus. The death of this 62-year-old doctor has highlighted the risks to which medical staff is exposed. Already in 2003, with the epidemic of SARS (acute and serious respiratory syndrome), a large part of the health personnel was affected while attending to infected people. Robots waiters but hospitals are not the only sites in which technology can be useful. For example, a Chinese urbanization uses a dron with thermal chambers to take the temperature of the neighbors without having to leave their homes, reports Zigor Aldama. In addition, a city in Hangzhou, a city of nine million inhabitants of China, an autonomous robot named Peanut is responsible for taking food to about 200 people in quarantine, according to China Xinhua News. These guests, such as the same medium, will remain at least two weeks isolated as a prevention measure because they traveled on the same plane as Wuhan passengers. \"hello! Peanut is serving the food, \"says the machine as it goes through the corridor slowly. For door per door with the goal that guests catch the menu. In a video uploaded to Twitter, a man with a mask who dresses a robe and a sneakers from home leaves him and take his room. \"take advantage. Please contact the hotel staff by Wechat if you need something else, \"adds the robot. By using WeChat, the most used instant messaging application in China, it is intended to avoid any direct contact with hotel workers. This robot, developed by the company Keenon, is designed to serve at restaurants, hotels, hospitals, offices, banks or airports. In fact, they are already present in a chain of restaurants in Madrid. The company explains on its website that Peanut has a voice recognition system and is endowed with artificial intelligence. so that the \nCommunication \"Be more interesting\", you can change the shape of your eyes in order to show emotions of happiness, anger or sadness. Robots that cleanse and disinfect the robots that interact with patients and those who take food, add those that can clean and disinfect different spaces. Xenex is a Texas-based company that sells robots to eliminate pathogens. These machines, as explained by the company on its own website, serve to quickly disinfect any room in just five minutes. \"Lightstrike disinfection technology has been proven to effectively reduce pollution by Coronavirus in clinical environments,\" he adds. Another company called DIMER has offered some airlines a robot to prevent the propagation of the virus. The company affirms on its website that commercial airlines play a direct role in the way diseases are spread throughout the world. \"Aircraft have the unique ability to transport germs through continents and oceans,\" he says.

scientific journal or reviewed by other scientists. trevor bedford, an associate professor who announced the preliminary findings on the virus in washington state, said on twitter late saturday that genetic similarities between the state's first case on jan. 20 and a case announced friday indicated the newer case may have descended from the earlier one. the jan. 20 case was the first known case in the u.s. \"i believe we're facing an already substantial outbreak in washington state that was not detected until now due to narrow case definition requiring direct travel to china,\" he said on twitter. bedford did not immediately reply to an e-mail requesting an interview sunday. scientists not affiliated with the research said the results did not necessarily surprise them and pointed out that for many people especially younger, healthier ones the symptoms are not much worse than a flu or bad cold. \"we think that this has a pretty high rate of mild symptoms and can be asymptomatic. the symptoms are pretty non-specific and testing criteria has been pretty strict, so those combinations of factors means that it easily could have been circulating for a bit without us knowing,\" said justin lessler, an associate professor of epidemiology at the johns hopkins bloomberg \nschool of public health. dr. adam lauring of university of michigan called the findings \"high quality work\" from scientists who've done similar work with the flu virus for years. \"they show their data and they show their work,\" lauring said. \"it's more than a series of tweets\" because the researchers back up what they found with data that they've shared online. \"if there's something wrong, someone will find it.\" dr. carlos del rio of emory university school of medicine said the findings are from respected researchers in genomic sequencing and they make sense because of the geographic proximity of the two cases. \"this is a good time to reinforce the things we all should be doing to stop the spread of flu. wash your hands. don't touch your face. if you have a cold, stay home ... it's a good time to remind ourselves of that,\" he said. pence, named by the president to be the point-person overseeing the government's response, said more than 15,000 virus testing kits had been released over the weekend. and, the administration is working with a commercial provider to distribute 50,000 more, he said. the vice president said testing was among the first issues raised by governors he's spoken with so far. several states have begun their own testing, including washington state, oregon and illinois. \"we're leaning into it,\" pence said. azar said more than 3,600 people already have been tested for coronavirus and the capability exists to test 75,000 people. he forecast a \"radical expansion of that\" in the coming weeks. pence and azar spoke a day after president donald trump approved new restrictions on international travel to prevent the spread within the u.s. of the new virus, which originated in china. there are now more than 80,000 cases worldwide and about 3,000 deaths. the number of known coronavirus cases in the u.s. had reached at least 80 as of sunday, counting people evacuated from a cruise ship and the city of wuhan in china. trump said saturday at a white house news \nconference that he was thinking about closing the southern border with mexico as a precaution. azar said sunday that mexico has few coronavirus cases and that it would take a dramatic change in the circumstances there to prompt serious consideration of a border shutdown. the president, azar said, \"was trying to say everything's on the table.\" \"we will take whatever measures are appropriate and necessary to protect the american people, but we don't forecast doing that any time soon,\" he said of closing the border. despite calls by trump and pence for political unity in the face of the viral threat, the issue has become mired in the partisan rancor in washington, with both republicans and democrats accusing each other of mining the issue for political gain. this story has been corrected to reflect that the hospitalized patient in rhode island is a man, not a woman, who traveled to italy in february.

Thus, according to own information, the National Health Commission drew away from the previous day from the nationwide total statistics because they have counted numbers from Hubei double. Already the day before there had been excitement because the number of newly confirmed infections had risen dramatically by 15,000. The cause was the new counting way by including the clinical diagnoses of COVID-19 lung disease from recent weeks. Since the DNA tests in the laboratory often can not be detected the infection, the cases where doctors have found a pneumonia, fever, respiratory problems and other typical Covid 19 symptoms and thus also without laboratory testing to a diagnosis the infection come.

The first case confirmed by the Coreavirus of Wuhan in Spain, a German tourist, is \"perfectly\" and does not present symptoms of the disease. He and five other German citizens who gave negative in the tests remain in quarantine at the Hospital Our Lady of Guadeloupe on the island of La Gomera to contain possible contagions, as reported on Saturday morning Fernando Sim\u00f3n, director of the Coordination Center of Emergencies of health.\nSimon has given some details of the case after a ministerial assessment and follow-up meeting of the Coronavirus, which has been held in the Ministry of Health. Right now there is no other case under study. The patient confirmed contracted the disease in Germany, after a \"very direct\" contact with an employee who had been transmitted by a colleague from China. When the contagion occurred, he had some symptoms (although he had not yet given positive), so the hypothesis that the disease can be transmitted by asymptomatic patients loses more and more weight, according to Simon.\nThe German tourists who are now in quarantine arrived in Spain on the 28th night coming from Munich. The next day, by notifying the German authorities the positive of the employee's case and having the evidence that those who had traveled to Spain had kept contact with him, it was decided, in principle, a house isolation in the municipality of Hermigua. After doing the tests, five of them gave negative, but they continue in quarantine and observation. The other gave positive, so the situation is of isolation in a hospital room, although, by not presenting symptoms, it does not require any special care. It is a precautionary measure.\nThe health authorities are now looking for possible contacts to follow up, in case of symptoms of the disease appear. Two people who will follow the track will be the ones who traveled by their side on the plane. President Canarian, \u00c1ngel Victor Torres, has reported this Saturday that tourists arrived in Tenerife and, from there, went to the gomenera by boat, reports Pedro Murillo. The affected one made the journey, an hour, next to a window, which \"minimizes the risks\". \"There is a precise description since he left Germany,\" the head of the Canary Islands epidemiology service, Domingo N\u00fa\u00f1ez. \"On the boat I did not move even to go to the bathroom; there was no contact with other passengers, there is no reason to think about risk contacts.\" From the port of San Sebasti\u00e1n de la Gomera moved by car rental to Hermigua, a Small town that is 20 kilometers from the capital where there are numerous rural houses.\nThe Minister of Health, Salvador Illa, has expressed his confidence in the National Health System. \"The detection and alert systems are resulting. We had already notified that it was possible that some case was detected in Spain,\" he said after the meeting among government leaders. ILA has announced that he will convene all health councilors from the Autonomous Communities in an Extraordinary Interiorritorial Council at the beginning of the week that comes to study the situation and, if necessary, reinforce the prevention and detection measures of the virus.\nMeanwhile, the Spaniards in quarantine who arrived on Friday at G\u00f3mez Ulla Hospital in Madrid are also in perfect condition, the ministry has reported. The center is coordinating how the regime of family visits will be. The score of nationals who are on the 17th floor of the military hospital premises do not require in principle testing, since they are not \"cases of risk\", in the words of Simon, \"simply remain in the quarantine\" that had already imposed China in Wuhan.\nThe coronavirus of Wuhan has already left 304 dead and more than 14,000 affected around the world. Of these, 151 are in 23 countries other than China. The rapid ascent of the number of cases - in just over a month has surpassed the serious acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the most similar background - and the first contagion outside of China - have already registered Not imported into Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, Taiwan and Vietnam - led to the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the international health emergency on Thursday.

one scientific post suggests links between the new coronavirus and aids, a second says it may have passed to people via snakes, while a third claims it is a pathogen from outer space.    the emergence in china of a new human coronavirus that is causing an epidemic of flu-like disease has sparked a parallel viral spread: science \u2013 ranging from robust to rogue - is being conducted, posted and shared at an unprecedented rate.    while speedy scientific analysis is highly useful if it's good, flawed or misleading science can sow panic and may make a disease epidemic worse by prompting false policy moves or encouraging risky behaviour.    a reuters analysis found that at least 153 studies - including epidemiological papers, genetic analyses and clinical reports - examining every aspect of the disease, now called covid-19 - have been posted or published since the start of the outbreak. these involved 675 researchers from around the globe.    by comparison, during the 2003 sars outbreak, it took more than a year for even half that number of studies to be published https://graphics.reuters.com/china-health-research/0100b5es3mg/index.html.    richard horton, editor-in-chief of the lancet group of science and medical journals, says he's instituted \"surge capacity\" staffing to sift through a flood of 30 to 40 submissions of scientific research a day to his group alone.    much of this work, according to those watching its flow and content, is rigorous and useful. vaccine developers, clinicians, diagnostic makers and policy agencies have snapped up genetic codes, phylogenetic trees and epidemiological models to help them start work on catching the virus and containing its spread.    but much of it is raw. with most fresh science being posted online without being peer-reviewed, some of the material lacks scientific rigour, experts say, and some has already been exposed as flawed, or plain wrong, and has \nbeen withdrawn.    \"the public will not benefit from early findings if they are flawed or hyped,\" said tom sheldon, a science communications specialist at britain's non-profit science media centre.        \"preprints\"    the threat posed by the new coronavirus requires that information be shared quickly and freely \"without being yoked to peer review\", sheldon said - and that is causing problems.    the outbreak has in particular encouraged \"preprints\" - the practice of researchers immediately posting online their findings without external checks, scrutiny or validation.    the reuters analysis scanned material on google scholar and on three preprint servers biorxiv, medrxiv and chemrxiv. of the 153 studies identified, some 60% were preprints.    preprints allow their authors to contribute to the scientific debate and can foster collaboration, but they are not peer-reviewed and can also bring researchers almost instant, international media and public attention.    \"some of the material that's been put out - on preprint servers for example - clearly has been... unhelpful,\" said the lancet's horton. \"whether it's fake news or misinformation or rumour-mongering, it's certainly contributed to fear and panic.\"    biorxiv has now added a yellow banner warning label across the top of any new coronavirus research which reads: \"a reminder: these are preliminary reports that have not been peer-reviewed. they should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice (or) health-related behaviour, or be reported in news media as established information.\"    one example was work by scientists in new delhi, india, who on jan. 31 posted research pointing to what they called \"uncanny\" similarities between the new coronavirus and hiv, the virus that causes aids.    the work was criticised by scientists around the world and swiftly retracted, but had already featured in more than 17,000 tweets and been picked up by 25 news outlets.    another was a submission sent to the lancet by \na researcher working in britain who claims the source of the new coronavirus may be \"viral in-fall\" from outer space.    and a study published online in the journal of medical virology on jan. 22, now known as \"the snake paper\", led to a rush of rumours that the china disease outbreak may be a kind of \"snake flu\". leading genetic experts cast swift doubt on the paper's findings, but not before it had gone viral.       pressure    part of the problem is pressure. to be first with a scientific finding is good for profile and for future funding -

In this market, although its official name described it as a point of sale of seafood and fish, numerous species of wild animals were sold, from cubs of wolf to bats.

(the opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for reuters) * cme copper money manager positioning: tmsnrt.rs/3a30zbh by andy home london, feb 24 (reuters) - funds have given up on their early-year hopes for higher copper prices. investors have turned bearish on the cme copper contract , slashing long positions and putting on fresh bets for lower prices. the net money manager short is now back at levels last seen in the third quarter of 2019, when market sentiment hit a \u201ctrade war\u201d trough. the deadly coronavirus has frozen the expected chinese manufacturing recovery story and is now showing signs of spreading to south korea, another industrial powerhouse. while equity markets have been taking a more sanguine view of the medium-term economic impact of the virus, copper is starting to price in the multiple short-term impacts on the physical supply chain. this is not just a demand story, however, since logistics problems are also affecting china\u2019s copper producers. that adds another layer of uncertainty to an already complex mix. money managers were net short of cme copper to the tune of 55,373 contracts as of feb. 18, according to the latest commitments of traders report. positioning was little changed week on week but the turnaround since the start of the year has been stark. the money men shifted to net long in december as china\u2019s stuttering manufacturing engine showed signs of recovery. however, those long positions have been slashed from over 81,511 contracts in the middle of january to a current 43,694. fresh short positions have accumulated over the same time frame with money managers now holding almost 100,000 contracts of bear bets. the collective negativity is the worst since peak trade-war blues in the third quarter of last year. hedge fund managers appear more focused on the current state of the physical copper market than the promise of a sharp economic \nrebound in china when beijing unleashes the investment taps. but then, as analysts at goldman sachs point out, the size of the short-term disruption is \u201cunprecedented\u201d. (\u201cthe impact of 2019-ncov on industrial metals\u201d, feb. 14, 2020) quarantining and restrictions on movement at a time when migrant workers would normally be expected to be returning to work mean the number of \u201cmissing work days\u201d in china is roughly \u201cequivalent to the entire u.s. workforce taking an unplanned break for two months.\u201d goldman has just cut its three, six and 12-month copper price forecasts from $6,300, $6,500 and $7,000 per tonne to $5,900, $6,200 and $6,500 respectively. the investment bank argues that the virus represents \u201ca meaningful demand shock for copper\u201d and is modelling a demand decline of 18% year on year in the first quarter. the promise of future stimulus risks blinding investors to \u201cthe physical realities of the disruption today,\u201d (\u201cpromise of stimulus builds downside risk to commodities\u201d, feb. 21, 2020). analysts at citi agree. \u201cour base case is for physical market weakness to dominate futures buying over the coming weeks,\u201d it said. (\u201cmetals weekly,\u201d feb. 18, 2020). \u201cthe chinese demand recovery is likely to be more gradual than many expect, since more than three-quarters of migrant workers are yet to return post (chinese new year), and half of these are not expected to return until march,\u201d the bank adds. a big short-term hit to copper demand will translate into surging inventories, which will in turn require hedge short positions to be built on the cme and london metal exchange (lme). citi estimates that 500,000 to 700,000 tonnes of industrial short positions could be seen, pressuring prices further. it\u2019s possible a massive counter-build in speculative positioning could compensate but it would require a sharp shift in the coronavirus news-flow such as a clinical drug breakthrough. signs of surplus metal are already starting to show in china. stocks of copper registered with \nthe shanghai futures exchange (shfe) have ballooned from 124,000 tonnes at the start of january to 298,600 tonnes. chinese copper inventory always rises over the new year holiday period but this year\u2019s 175,000-tonne surge is already outpacing the peak january-march build of 143,000 tonnes in 2019 and 156,000 tonnes in 2018. inventories at bonded warehouses in shanghai are also thought to be rising. the pronounced contango across the front part of the shfe copper futures curve suggests the local market is expecting more surplus metal to appear in the coming weeks. mitigating some of the demand shock may be lower chinese copper production as smelters face their own physical supply-chain headaches. smelters are struggling both to receive enough mined concentrate to keep running and to sell the sulphuric acid they generate as a by-product of making copper. \u201cthere is a general loss of efficiency across the concentrates supply chain from ports to smelters due to restrictions on movement and extension of holidays for couriers, customs brokers, customs, etc.,\u201d according to research house wood mackenzie. it notes that multiple chinese smelters are experiencing concentrates delivery delays. (\u201ccoronavirus and its impact on the copper market,\u201d feb. 6, 2020). the acid market in china, meanwhile, has partially ground to a halt. woodmac estimates that hubei province, the epicentre of the virus outbreak, is the largest phosphate fertilizer producer in china and accounts for around 20% of the country\u2019s sulphuric acid consumption. copper smelters have only limited acid storage capacity, threatening their ability to maintain production. one producer, guangxi nanguo copper with production capacity of 300,000 tonnes per year, has already declared partial force majeure on concentrate deliveries as it adjusts run-rates. others are expected to follow by bringing forward planned maintenance downtime. lower domestic copper production and the likely push-back of smelter expansion projects \noffer only a partial offset to the demand shock unfolding in china. they do, however, inject yet more uncertainty and potential price volatility into an already complex equation. so too does the apparent spread of the virus to south korea and northern italy, each of which poses another set of physical supply-chain problems. the current \u201chigh degree of uncertainty about the size and duration of the disruptions (will) mean industrial metals are likely to face significant headwinds and rising volatility in coming months,\u201d according to goldman sachs. fund managers appear to agree.

media interview, patient 31 said she did not refuse to be tested. but health authorities said she sought care at a traditional medicine hospital in daegu after a minor car accident, where a medical worker who treated her later tested positive for the virus. while running a fever, she went to a buffet at a hotel and the church services. shincheonji is in the biggest crisis in its 36-year history, as hundreds of members have tested positive for the virus, sars-cov-2. all of its 210,000 known followers are being tested amid unprecedented scrutiny from authorities and the public. after initial resistance, the church released the addresses of 1,100 \nfacilities around the country - 82 churches and 1,018 \u201caffiliates,\u201d - and asked the public to avoid making \u201cgroundless criticism.\u201d it was the \u201cbiggest victim of the virus,\u201d it said. calls by reuters to the church\u2019s headquarters seeking comment went unanswered. during a visit to the daegu branch on friday, a man who identified himself as a member said he was the only one there and told reuters that \u201call of our 9,000 members are taking self-quarantine measures in compliance with the government instruction.\u201d he said the building was disinfected twice last week. interactive graphic about the spread of coronavirus inside south korea: here south korea reported 334 new cases of the coronavirus on thursday, bringing the national tally to 1,595. more than 1,000 are from daegu, according to the korea centres for disease control and prevention (kcdc), and nearly 600 are directly linked to shincheonji\u2019s branch there. kcdc said that it is still investigating the exact origin of the outbreak, but that five or six other members of the church were infected together with patient 31. the church had a presence in wuhan, the center of the virus in china, according to the kcdc, though it is unclear whether that played a role. also known as the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony, the church was founded and is headed by self-proclaimed messiah lee man-hee. \u201cthis disease case is the devil\u2019s deed to stop the rapid growth of shincheonji,\u201d lee said in a message on friday on an internal app used by members. but its secretive practices and often-aggressive recruitment tactics have made the church a controversial presence in south korea\u2019s religious community. new members are forced to leave home and live in dormitories as part of initiation. many break ties with their family and begin aggressively recruiting new members, an said. according to its website, followers must undergo six months of classes and complete a demanding written exam before \u201cgraduating\u201d and joining the church. the \nchurch has denied previous reports by christian news organizations describing it as a \u201cbrainwashing cult\u201d, calling those accusations \u201cblatant lies\u201d and a plot to rein in its expansion. all members work as \u201charvesters\u201d tasked with courting new followers from other churches, dubbed \u201charvest fields\u201d, former members said. \u201cit may appear christian, but is actually completely different. they revere founder lee man-hee as a saviour, like jesus,\u201d said lee duck-sure, a christian pastor who runs a counseling center in seoul for former members of shincheonji. south koreans vented anger after an official at a daegu public health center that carries out virus tests continued to work even after he was told to get tested. he revealed he was a member of the daegu shincheonji church only after the test showed he was infected, daegu officials said. but health officials and experts cautioned the blame should not be focused on the church and its believers, saying they were also victims. kcdc is also looking into links between the church and a hospital in nearby cheongdo county, which reported the second-highest number of patients in the country with more than 110. the county is a holy site for shincheonji believers as the birthplace of lee, and recently a funeral for his older brother was held at that hospital. on a recent visit, the daegu church was shuttered and silent, surrounded by empty streets and closed stores. someone had thrown eggs at the front gate of the building. son, who did not want to give her full name and lives in the neighborhood, said many believers, especially young women, have moved to live near the church, and several restaurants are run by members. doo song-ja, 64, said she had not heard from her daughter since 2015, when she joined the church. \u201ci\u2019m so worried because so many shincheonji followers are testing positive but i don\u2019t know where she is,\u201d said doo, who said her 33-year-old daughter had sued her for

prompting police to intervene, he said. similar scenes were witnessed in maharashtra, delhi and noida. govt rushes to solve essential services hick-ups  while the prime minister on tuesday said that all essential services and goods will be available to the public during the lockdown, the public reacted with panic buying. however, the governments in the center and states today assured people that they are taking a series of measures to ensure the seamless delivery of the essentials. the government has said that there is no shortage of essential commodities. most of the state governments on wednesday held meetings with heads of e-commerce sites, vendors, retail chains, etc to figure out ways to create a door-to-door delivery system. cops in these states have also been sensitised about

for the poor and affected keeping in mind the financial burden the lockdown has caused on the poor contractual labourers, several state government have come up with schemes to put money in the accounts of those affected. delhi cm has announced a relief fund of rs 5,000 per person, bihar has said that all ration card holding families will get rs 1,000. the rajasthan government on wednesday released a sum of rs 310 crore in order to deposit rs 1,000 per family in the bank accounts of economically backward sections amidst the lockdown imposed to contain the coronavirus spread. the punjab police distributed food to the poor in many parts of the state and also ensured home delivery of essentials to daily wagers and slum \ndwellers amid a country-wide lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus. meanwhile, clamour rose up from the states demanding fiscal packages for the battle against the coronavirus. west bengal chief minister mamata banerjee sought a rs 1,500 crore package from the centre to support the state government's efforts to deal with the coronavirus outbreak. the tamil nadu government has sought special assistance of rs 4,000 crore from the centre to implement measures to tackle covid-19, saying the state's revenues have \"also taken a hit\" in this \"unprecedented situation.\" therefore, as a one-time measure, the fiscal deficit limit of three per cent of gross state domestic product may be relaxed for the financial years 2019-20 and 2020-21, chief minister k palaniswami said in a letter to prime minister narendra modi. he said that of the rs 4,000 crore, rs 3,000 crore will be required for the health sector at \"this crucial juncture\". the left parties have slammed the government over its \"failure\" to introduce \"concrete measures\" to deal with the coronavirus pandemic and questioned why an economic package had not yet been announced for the poor. in an open letter to the prime minister, cpi(m) general secretary sitaram yechury said his government has taken no measures to assist poor migrants who are most hurt by the sudden lockdown and a large number of them are stranded without food or shelter. \"it is very disappointing that no concrete measures have been announced so far to provide relief to the poor and the needy, and to alleviate the suffering of those who need urgent help at this moment to survive the lockdown. #covid2019 \"how will they (migrants) reach safe spaces? how will they survive without money or food and with reports of police harassment too?,\" he said in the letter. economic package for the poor likely soon the package, which could be announced by the end of the week, will be used to put money directly into the accounts of more than 100 million poor and to \nsupport businesses hit the hardest by the lockdown, the sources said. pm modi warns of strict action against those misbehaving with medical, police, airline personnel prime minister narendra modi has warned of strict action against those misbehaving with people on the frontline of the fight against coronavirus like doctors and airline crew, and sought the cooperation of citizens with administration to deal with the crisis. asked about reports of misbehaviour with medical personnel and airline crew during avideo conference with people in varanasi, he said he was pained by this and has asked the home ministry and state dgps to take tough action against culprits. if anybody targets doctors, nurses and all those rendering their service during this crisis, then it will cost them dearly, modi said, adding people in white like doctors and nurses are like gods. citizens should also object if they see anybody misbehaving with these professionals, he added. there have been reports of medical personnel and airline crew being harassed in their neighborhood by some vigilante residents because they might have dealt with suspected cases. pm modi also asked people to cooperate with the government and the administration, and not to pressure them, for better results during the lockdown period. \"there may be incidents of some shortcoming or negligence. but looking for such cases and focussing and publicising them, discouraging some sector will not benefit at this time. there can be a thousand reasons to spread pessimism. i am not saying they are all wrong but life runs on hope and trust,\" he said. doctors, police personnel and many others have been working very hard and should be encouraged, he said. they should be publicly feted, he said. global toll from coronavirus surpasses 20,000 the coronavirus

It is the summary of a dozen contacts made by the public for agencies and operators who organize and market finalists. None is officially ready to move forward with repayments and, although, as a responsible for Sporjovem, register \"enough\" calls of \"worried parents\", there is no cancellations. Even because the note of the Directorate-General for School Establishments (DGESTE), released on Wednesday, only \"advises\" considering student visits abroad (in general) and Prime Minister Ant\u00f3nio Costa said \"might advice to avoid If you \"do such trips. Faced with the lack of a concrete directive, companies in the sector, contacted this Thursday, they were only alert and awaiting new developments to comment more substantially the theme. \"We are tracking the development of the situation with great attention and concern since its inception in December, and monitoring the recommendations given by the competent bodies,\" says Catarina Reis, Megafinalists (GEOSTAR), which has two major programs for finalists around Easter - Andorra and Sal\u00f3, in Catalonia, region where a case of Covid-19 (Barcelona) has already been confirmed. The person in advance that \"at the moment\", \"there is no change to the travel program.\" Ida Andorra has the detail of having the sponsorship of the Sumol brand. According to the adviser for communication, J\u00falio Gomes, Sumol + Compal was, in the afternoon, still analyzing the data and communications of the competent authorities to decide to remove support - which would lead to cancellation of the Sumol travel Snowtrip, a program that is 15 years ago. Already Sporjovem, responsible for taking the Easter vacation about six thousand students to \nMarina d'or (Valencian Community, already with eight registered cases), assumes that you have received \"quite\" phone calls from \"worried parents\" to ask for more information and clarifications. During those days, all the accommodation units of the Valencian tourist complex are reserved by the company, so \"Destiny will only have Portuguese tourists\", stresses responsible. So far, says the coordinator, Rita Veiga, received no request for annulment of the reservation. The official indicates that it remains in \"daily contact with the Portuguese and local authorities [Spanish] and with the tourism of Portugal\" and which, so far, no indication of any of these authorities cancel the program. Rita Veiga also defends that, in case the event is canceled by express indication of the authorities, it would be necessary to \"see with the tourism of Portugal and with companies that have signed the health insurance of each student about who falls the responsibility\" of repayments. As for cases of giving up before this indication, the Sporjovem coordinator refers to the general conditions published on the company's website. These report that: \"forductions made less than 30 days, including the start date of the trip have 100% spending, and no value is reimbursed. With more than 30 days the customer will have to pay a minimum value of \u20ac 70 per person. \" A month of the event, from March 28 to April 6, is already \"all marked and paid\": from accommodation to transport, as well as artists that integrate programming. However, Rita Veiga says \"not knowing values\" regarding possible losses. A change in the event destination is not on top of the table, but the agency can come to \"ponder change dates\". Also under consideration are large companies that market finalist travel, case of Agency Abreu that, after the initial publication of this article, sent to the public a comment in writing: \"We have several customers to call or visit \nOur stores and ask questions about whether or should or should cancel, \"says the commercial director of the Agency, Pedro Quintela. Emphasizing that it provides \"clarification\" and cancellations and reimbursements \"for destinations considered by the World Health Organization and referred to in the Communities Portal as risk destinations\" (from 24/01, China, Hong and Macao; from the last From the week, Northern Italy), the person in charge of the finalist programs, refers them, for another general field, that of the organized trips to destinations that were still not considered at risk. \"We will analyze case by case, managing situations due to the risk that is defined by WHO. Other destinations other than these defined (by WHO), will have to be always analyzed and discussed, \"he said. General practice, in this case: If \"a client wants to cancel a tour package (...) will only be reimbursed from the value between the cost of the trip and the cost that the travel agency has already had or will have with this program\", \"depending on also of the covers of the complementary insurance that the customer may have acquired. \" In the field of the most specialized, such as the trips, which promotes eight alternative destinations for the finalists, there was still no defined position, while the company is studying and waiting for official restrictions. Contact other companies such as Slide In, Student Travelers or Travel Fun, could not have the comment for them until the time of publication of this article. Case for the Portuguese Association of Travel and Tourism Agencies (APAVT), whose president, Pedro Costa Ferreira, admitted, still on Wednesday in a public / Renaissance interview, which was \"reasonable\" say that \"the sector will have a problem in Easter\". \"The big reservations start now during March, Easter is in April and one is not expected to be a peak of reserves with all this environment, which has not yet reached its peak,\" prophesied, remacing that \"Easter effect \nwill have a negative effect on the sector. Because obviously if there are no reservations and there are no trips there will be fewer recipes, less invoicing. \" As the aim is to ensure the \"Portuguese Student Safety\", the National Youth Council (CNJ), where they also have a number of student associations, indicated that \"subscribes\" the warning made by DGESTE. As for the dilemma opened with the travel agencies on a possible reimbursement of the payments already made by families, Rita Skirts considers that \"does not fit the CNJ in this context to pronounce on specific cases,\" but leaves another alert: \"This situation is Just one more that comes to demonstrate the need to review the finalist travel model as a whole. \" Bestay, the two national confederations of parents' associations have already asked for \"common sense\" to contracted agencies for finalist excursions. The destination of many finalist trips is usually south of Spain, where several cases of infection are already confirmed. \"It is concerned not only the security of the students, but also the national interest in controlling the spread of the disease,\" says the president of the National Confederation of Parents' Associations (Confap), Jorge Ascement. \"If I had already paid I would rather be without the money than to take the risk of my daughter to contract the infection,\" says the president of the independent confederation of parents and in charge of education (CNIP), Rui Martins, who expects however a position \"Good sense of all parts so as to minimize the damage of all.\" The Portuguese Association for Consumer Protection - Deco refers to a text with general advice on coronavirus and travel, still with nothing specific for finalist trips. As they have commented on some agencies responsible, the online document regarding organized trips, stresses the right to reimbursement in China and North Destinations of Italy. \"The law allows the traveler to rescinda the contract to \nAny time, before starting the trip. And you will not have to pay the travel agency any termination fee because you find exceptional circumstances at the destination place or in its proximity that considerably affect the scheduled trip. \" But: \"It will only be in relation to the destinies severely affected by the virus. It can not be a fruit of a mere reception of the traveler. \" In relation to travel insurance, in \"None of the policies analyzed if it considers the reason for the cancellation of the journey by recital of contagion,\" summarizes Deco. \"So we can not say, widely, that travel insurance can be activated due to coronavirus. It depends on the policy and the situation that is intended to ensure, as payment of the medical expenses of those who have been infected during a trip, or reimbursement of expenses with the cancellation of a trip, for example. \" No directives expressed to other destinations, it is \"impossible to give a single answer to these issues.\" Subscribe newsletters for free and receive the best of the publicity and the deepest jobs of the public.

The first confirmed coronavirus patient in Germany was probably infected with a Chinese guest of his company. The woman from China had been to a continuing education at the company Webasto in the district of Starnberg in Upper Bavaria and has been positively tested for the virus after her return to China, the company announced. The Bavarian health authorities confirmed the description. The infected is therefore in the Munich Klinikum Schwabing. He should continue to be isolated and would be monitored. The man is a 33-year-old from the district Landsberg am Lech. \"He's pretty good, yesterday morning he still worked,\" said the President of the Bavarian Provincial Office for Health and Food Safety, Andreas Zapf. The woman from Shanghai had a visit to Germany from her parents before her trip, which come from the particularly affected Chinese region Wuhan. She was falling back on 23 January and felt sick on the way home. There are no further suspected cases, according to Zapf so far, \"We have not yet found any other symptoms.\" But that was \"now, 10.30 clock\". The authorities are currently busy finding out with whom the two employees of Webasto had contact. That must now \"go very quickly\".

There is no risk for fellow patients. The workforce in the Stockdorfer Webasto headquarters has released the management for this week, to come to the office or to work from home. Earlier before, the company had canceled all the service tracks to China for the next two weeks. Webasto manufactures mainly car roofs and stand heating and has more than ten locations in China. The largest factory is located in the million metropolis Wuhan, in which the novel lung disease had broken out first. In the case of Bavaria, it is one of the three first known human-to-human infections outside of Asia. So far, only a transfer from man to person in Vietnam had been detected outside the country of origin, China said a spokeswoman of the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin. So far, almost all of the approximately fifty-collected infections in France, the US, Thailand and other Asian countries were imported cases. The people concerned had infected with a trip to China. Only very scattered cases of infections between narrow family members were known, but no transmissions, for example, on clinic staff, work colleagues or random contacts. Meanwhile, more than 4,500 infections are confirmed worldwide with the Virus 2019 NCOV virus. The number of dead in China rose on Tuesday to more than 100. Because of the lung disease, more and more countries want to retrieve their nationals from the particularly affected regions, such as Great Britain and Belgium, Japan, France and the USA. Also, the Federal Government is also considered to be released from Germany from China. Possible evacuation is considered, said Foreign Minister Heiko Maas (SPD) on Monday, before the confirmed case known from Bavaria \nbecame. For fear of an introduction, Hong Kong announced on Tuesday to largely close his border for Chinese from the People's Republic. All tensile and ferry connections will be discontinued by Thursday at midnight, director Carrie Lam announced. After no more packages from China have been allowed, the authorities of the People's Republic have been agreed to suspend all individual travel Chinese citizen. The World Health Organization WHO meanwhile warns of panicmaking. He was confident that China could control and curb the spread, WHO Secretary-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, according to the State News Agency Xinhua, after a meeting with authority representatives in Beijing. He advocates the measures of the Chinese government. According to Tedros, it was off, on the other hand, to bring foreigners who are currently holding themselves in China. At the same time he urged people to keep calm. At the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities of the World Health Organization WHO reported an accumulation of pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause in the Central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the diseases. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days then a group released a group of the virologen Christian's premier from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 the first diagnostic test for the new virus, the researcher provisionally call 2019-NCOV. With the test, the virus can be detected in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, on which, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected. Both the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as well as Mers (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses \nhave origin in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more than 750 died. With the MERS virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronaviruses. Many of them relate to respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example. In China, several thousand persons are suffering from them, some of them - most of them with pre-existing conditions - have died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first infection cases outside of China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been in Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection with a tourist, who came back from Wuhan, on January 24, the first cases were known in France. Meanwhile, first cases were confirmed in Germany. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. The virus can cause pneumonia that can endally end. Since it is a viral illness, antibiotics do not help. Meanwhile, it is clear that the virus can be transferred from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transfers after a dozen cases were known in medical staff. Medizors assume that the virus is transmitted above all over droplet infection. The World Health Organization calculates, as announced on January 24, at the moment that an infected one cuts 1.4 to 2.5 other people. Contest these numbers, the virus is less contagious than SARS and also the viral flu. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals. the \nCan not say certainly. The World Health Organization said on 28 January that about one-fifth of the reported cases through the virus will be seriously ill, so in case of doubt must be treated intensive care. According to reports, the first death pots were patients who had some severe pre-existing conditions. Even with other infectious diseases, people with pre-existing diseases are particularly endangered - for example at the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so change their genome. This can cause you to become more dangerous for people in the course of an outbreak - but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) expects no similar mortality to the current time as the outbreak of SARS.

prime minister lee hsien loong said on march 17 the flow of goods and cargo from malaysia would continue during the lockdown, having received reassurances from his malaysian counterpart, mr muhyiddin yassin.   there was no need to worry, other political leaders chimed in. \u201ca disruption of supplies from malaysia is a contingency scenario we have planned for many years,\u201d said minister for trade and industry chan chun sing on the same day.   with the movement of goods across the causeway mostly unaffected, \nsingapore appears to have dodged a bullet. and even if the lockdown affects malaysia\u2019s ability to produce food for itself \u2014 malaysia had considered stopping exports of eggs and seafood to singapore for its own consumption back in 2018 \u2014 singapore\u2019s robust food diversification strategy would mean there is no real cause for concern.   however, if the covid-19 pandemic rages on globally, the rising number of quarantines and nationwide lockdowns could diminish agricultural labour and threaten global food production. this could put unprecedented pressure on singapore\u2019s food security, said experts.   then, there is also the issue of climate change.   under the spotlight   in recent weeks, in light of the covid-19 outbreak, images of empty supermarket shelves here have turned the spotlight on the island\u2019s food security \u2014 an esoteric concept for many but one that has worried authorities and academics for decades.   after all, singapore is supposed to be a food paradise where no one can possibly starve, with stocks so abundant that food waste is regarded as a societal problem, said mr veera sekaran, one of the directors of indoor vertical farming firm vertivegies.   \u201cwith covid-19, the urgency of singapore\u2019s food security has suddenly cropped up again,\u201d he said.    suppliers of fresh produce at pasir panjang wholesale centre continued to receive their daily imports of vegetables and fruits from malaysia on wednesday (march 18). photo: mandy lee/today   now that the covid-19 pandemic, along with the economic and social upheaval that it brings, is expected to last until the end of 2020 or beyond, impacting all corners of the globe, there is a chance that singapore\u2019s food security strategies will be tested again, said experts.   self-reliant, diversified approach   to meet such challenges, the singapore food agency (sfa) was formed in april last year to focus solely on food-related issues. securing the country\u2019s food security is its core mission.   singapore has planned for \nfood supply disruptions for years, putting in place a comprehensive strategy after the food crisis of 2007 and 2008, which saw the global prices of food shoot up dramatically due to trade shocks, rising oil prices and food stocks diverted to produce biofuels.   as a result of all its planning, singapore topped the global food security index of 113 countries by the economist intelligence unit in 2018 and 2019. before that, it had been in the top three positions of the index \u2014 which measures affordability, availability, quality and safety of food source in each country \u2014 for several years.   however, when climate-related and natural-resource risk factors were taken into account, singapore fell to 12th place in the 2019 index.   dr cecilia tortajada, senior research fellow at the lee kuan yew school of public policy\u2019s institute of water policy, noted singapore\u2019s high ranking in food security, attributing this to its ability to ensure the safety, availability and affordability of food.   nevertheless, \u201cthe main challenge, which is unavoidable given the size of the city-state, is dependence on foreign produce to a very high percentage,\u201d said dr tortajada. the republic currently imports more than 90 per cent of the food it consumes.   for any nation, forming a viable food security strategy is usually a fine balancing act between self-reliance and self-sufficiency, said professor paul teng, an adjunct senior fellow at the centre for non-traditional security studies in the s. rajaratnam school of international studies (rsis).   self-sufficiency means a country is able to produce its own food and stand on its own feet, and is practised by larger countries such as indonesia and the philippines. both seek to be fully self-sufficient in rice production, for example.   self-reliance, on the other hand, means the country imports food but also relies on some level of domestic food production, said prof teng, a food security expert who has been studying the topic for more than \nthree decades.   singapore is forced to belong to the second category because it does not have that luxury of natural resources, ample land and water. it has to be self-reliant, using explicit policies to safeguard its food supplies while having some domestic production capability of its own, prof teng added.   as such, animal husbandry gave way to urban development, and the once familiar chicken coops and pig farms that dotted singapore\u2019s landscape in the 60s and 70s eventually had to go.   said prof teng: \u201cmost agricultural and food economists argue in favour of this self-reliance approach\u2026 because food security at the household level is linked to gdp (gross domestic product) per capita.\u201d   most households, for example, currently spend a relatively small portion of their incomes on food and thus have a \u201cbuffering capacity\u201d should prices surge in response to supply declines. thus, food security and rising prosperity goes hand in hand.   \u201cscarce resources of land, water and labour can be better deployed to activities which have higher economic value than farming,\u201d he said.    singapore has planned for food supply disruptions for years, putting in place a comprehensive strategy after the food crisis of 2007 and 2008, which saw the global prices of food shoot up dramatically due to trade shocks, rising oil prices and food stocks diverted to produce biofuels. photo: najeer yusof/today \u00a0   but without domestic food production, which comes under the nation\u2019s sovereign control, there is a risk of importing food from a single source. as such, singapore has strived to import from as many sources as possible.   environment and water resources minister masagos zulkifli said singapore\u2019s approach is to grow its \u201cthree food baskets\u201d\u2014 to diversify its sources of imported food, encourage firms to grow food overseas, and expand its local produce industry.   today, singapore\u2019s food imports come from over 170 countries and regions around the world, up from 160 in 2007.   this \ndiversification of food sources did not occur overnight, and is a culmination of years of sourcing trips and prudent procurement decisions to ensure that the nation will not starve.   such a strategy provides resiliency to singapore\u2019s supply of food, said prof teng.   while any disruption by a single source does hurt, it is not a complete wipeout if the country has the ability to quickly top up the shortfall from other sources, said experts.   said mr masagos last month: \u201c(singapore\u2019s) heavy reliance on food imports makes us vulnerable to short-term disruptions arising from supply shortages, crop failures or animal diseases.   referring to the sfa\u2019s predecessor the agri-food and veterinary authority of singapore (ava), he added: \u201cwe have proven resilient to such disruptions, largely thanks to the astute planning of then-ava , and the logistics and connectivity of our transport network. that is why, when some singaporeans started buying up food (in february), and photos of empty supermarket shelves were circulated, we were able to say with full confidence that there is enough food for everyone. there is no risk of us running short of essential food and household items.\u201d   singapore demonstrated this resiliency again just days after malaysia \u2014 the source of more than 90 per cent of the island\u2019s imported eggs \u2014 announced at around 10pm on march 16 that it would be locking down its borders from march 18 to 31.      on march 19, mr chan posted pictures of a \u201cspecial cargo\u201d of more than 300,000 eggs arriving at changi airport by air freight. these eggs were understood to be from thailand (one of singapore\u2019s several alternative sources), though they constituted a fraction \u2014 less than 10 per cent \u2014 of what singapore consumes on a daily basis.   said mr chan: \u201cwe also have many other source countries which we have identified over the years and are able to activate them quickly when the need calls for it.   \u201cthis applies not just to eggs but other food products and essential \nitems. we managed to activate this option in a matter of two days.\u201d   back in 2018, when malaysia said that it was considering limiting exports of eggs and some types of seafood to ensure a sufficient supply for its domestic market, singapore began in the same month to import eggs from ukraine.   the republic also imports eggs from australia, denmark, japan, new zealand, spain, sweden, south korea, thailand and the united states.   the number of hen shell eggs imported from sources other than malaysia has increased from an average of 1.4 per cent of total imports in 2018 to 5.7 per cent of total imports in december 2019, said an sfa spokesman in response to today\u2019s queries.   but diversification is not just about putting many eggs in many baskets. the smart thing to do is to pick countries that regularly show a large surplus over domestic consumption for the food concerned, said prof teng.   thus when a global food crisis occurs, the risks of jostling over limited food resources can be reduced.    back in 2018, when malaysia said that it was considering limiting exports of eggs and some types of seafood to ensure a sufficient supply for its domestic market, singapore began in the same month to import eggs from ukraine. photo: najeer yusof/today   another way is to encourage singapore\u2019s agricultural firms to grow food abroad and scale-up during \u201cpeacetime\u201d, and bring the produce back to the country in times of crisis.   \u201cby venturing overseas, companies can overcome land and manpower constraints and access new and bigger markets. they are then able to reap economies of scale and can also export food back to singapore,\u201d said the sfa spokesman.   mr eric ng, chief executive of apollo aquaculture, said his firm is able to take advantage of lower costs by locating part of its operations in brunei through a joint venture with the brunei government.   \u201cif singapore is facing a national crisis, we are able to ship or fly the produce back to singapore in a very short time,\u201d \nsaid mr ng. his land-based vertical fish farm in lim chu kang produces around 2,500 tonnes of food fish each year, while his brunei farm can produce up to 800 tonnes a year.   while there is a risk that the local government could block any exports of food during global food crises, mr ng said that is why the choice of country matters \u2014 brunei and singapore share strong ties and a mutual understanding of food security.   singapore\u2019s adroit diplomacy does not hurt either. \u201cit was a call from prime minister lee to the malaysian government that guaranteed that goods will continue to flow during the lockdown,\u201d he noted.   when protracted crisis hits   despite the best-laid plans, a prolonged and escalating crisis, such as what the covid-19 pandemic is shaping up to be, may still push singapore\u2019s diversification strategy to its limit.   such a crisis entails a widespread impact on the world\u2019s food-exporting countries, including the key sources that singapore imports significant amounts of food from, such as malaysia, indonesia, vietnam, china, brazil, australia, the netherlands, spain, south africa and the united states.   this is singapore\u2019s \u201cachilles\u2019 heel\u201d, warned prof teng.   since the start of the health crisis in china last december, the covid-19 pandemic has gone global and spread to 177 countries. several of them, including major food-exporting countries to singapore, are experiencing what looks to be an exponential growth of new confirmed cases. as of friday, there were more than 240,000 confirmed cases around the world.   if the situation continues to escalate and the surplus food capacity of these nations nosedives, the rise of food insecurity around the world could put singapore\u2019s food imports at risk.   when it comes to that, there is another layer of defence: the national stockpiles.   this is where the ministry of trade and industry, which operates the rice stockpile scheme, comes in. apart from rice, other essential items such as infant milk powder, n95 \nmasks and surgical face masks are stockpiled too.   the scheme requires importers of white rice, basmati rice, ponni rice and parboiled rice to pre-commit the quantity that they wish to import each month to sell in singapore. then, they would have to stockpile twice that quantity by keeping it in a government-designated warehouse, and to replace the stockpile with new stock as the rice cannot be kept in the warehouses for more than a year.   while the rice importer owns the rice, the government has the right to acquire the rice during an emergency, with compensation.   details of the size of singapore\u2019s stockpile are usually not revealed for national security reasons as well as not to hamper negotiations with overseas suppliers.    infographic: samuel woo and anam musta'ein/today\u00a0   in a bid to reassure singaporeans, however, mr chan gave a glimpse into the strength of the nation\u2019s current stockpile: \u201cfor carbohydrates, like rice and noodles, we have more than three months\u2019 worth of stockpile at the national level.   \u201cfor proteins like meat, and vegetables, we use a combination of fresh, frozen and canned options to meet our demand and we have more than two months\u2019 worth of supplies at normal consumption patterns,\u201d he said on march 17, the morning after malaysia\u2019s sudden announcement.   eggs, which do not fall under the stockpile scheme, have similar safeguards. since april last year, egg importers have been required to provide the sfa with a viable business continuity plan \u2014 such as holding their own buffer stockpile or signing retainer contracts with suppliers \u2014 to mitigate the impact of supply disruptions, said an sfa spokesman.   yet, stockpiles are finite and would only last as long as advertised based on regular consumption patterns.   conventional wisdom suggests that in a crisis, people should naturally tighten their belts and reduce unnecessary consumption in order to avoid wasting food.   however, what has been difficult to anticipate and to plan for are \nthe socio-psychological responses to perceived food shortages, as evident by the most recent run on vegetables, chicken and eggs on tuesday, prof teng said.   dr tortajada added that these supermarket runs does not necessarily mean that food is unavailable. rather, it shows the limits of resupplying amid the unplanned rush \u2014 a point which government leaders had alluded to during the recent episodes of mass buying.   \u201cpanic shopping puts stress on any supply chains,\u201d dr tortajada said.   asked what could singapore do if the national stockpiles run dry, prof teng said this would be uncharted territory.   food rationing could be imposed, and singapore could tap regional stockpiles such as the asean plus three emergency rice reserves. it could also work out new bilateral trade deals with countries with large export stockpiles, though this would likely come with large price spikes, he said.   harvesting local produce in times of crisis   singapore could also drastically ramp up its local food production, prof teng added.   currently, less than 10 per cent of singapore\u2019s food is locally grown.   farms could also be converted to grow emergency food crops, which are quickly grown, provide essential nutritional value, take up less room, but may not be grown in \u201cpeacetime\u201d due to commercial reasons. these \u201csurvival plants\u201d include potatoes, maize, beans, carrots, lettuce and tomatoes.   can it be done? some, like vertivegies\u2019 mr veera sekaran, believe it is possible to scale up, as long as the government leads the way.   \u201cif it is a national security issue, it is absolutely possible that the government provides the land and mobilises people, with experienced farmers providing the expertise. farming is not rocket science, and there is land on rooftops, underneath expressways that all can be converted for this purpose,\u201d said mr sekaran.   but the issue of urban farming and local produce has always revolved around commercial limitations \u2014 the price of locally grown food will \nalways be higher than imported food due to the costs of land, manpower and raw materials here.   mr edvin lim, director of egg producer chew\u2019s agriculture, said it will take at least six months to ramp up the local egg production, as the chickens need about 18 weeks to grow before they start laying eggs.   foreign alternatives, such as eggs from malaysia and ukraine, can cost around 20 to 30 per cent cheaper compared with those produced by local farms.   \u201cit is not a matter of supply, but of commercial demand,\u201d said mr lim. \u201cwe are very willing to ramp up production provided the market can absorb it.\u201d   his farm currently produces around half a million eggs each day, which can be scaled up to 800,000 eggs daily in the near future.    mr edvin lim, director of egg producer chew\u2019s agriculture, said it will take at least six months to ramp up the local egg production, as the chickens need about 18 weeks to grow before they start laying eggs. photo: najeer yusof/today   on its end, the government has not sat idly by when it comes to local produce.   in march last year, mr masagos said that by 2030, singapore aims to provide 30 per cent of its nutritional needs with homegrown produce, using less than 1 per cent of its land area.   such a target calls for a multi-fold increase in current agricultural production. local produce will need to account for 10 per cent of the proteins and 20 per cent of the fruits and vegetables consumed by singapore.   this, he said, is the most \u201cambitious\u201d leg of the government\u2019s three-basket strategy.   sfa and the mewr has been raising awareness of local produce on several fronts. this year, it launched the 2020: singapore food story campaign and new branding to help consumers identify local produce. it is also encouraging the smaller farms to form consortiums so they may collectively bring their produce to market domestically \u2014 which is \u201ckey for local produce to be price-competitive\u201d, said the sfa spokesman.   the spokesman added: \u201cwhile \nthe average price of our local produce may be higher, we want to educate our consumers why they should select local produce. local produce is safe, fresher, lasts longer, and there is less spoilage and food waste, as the produce does not need to travel for long periods of time before reaching the consumer.   \u201cthis also means a lower carbon footprint was taken to bring the food to your tables.\u201d   since 2017, sfa has been awarding agriculture land, through a competitive land tender basis, to agri-food companies with promising technologies. this year, sfa will be studying how the larger lim chu kang agriculture area can be planned and redeveloped to enhance food production, said mr masagos in the debate on his ministry\u2019s budget earlier this month.   over the past five years, sfa has committed s$38 million from the s$63 million agriculture productivity fund (apf) to support more than 100 farms in their productivity-enhancing investments, and the support will be extended through 2020 as well.   with the aid of the apf, chew\u2019s agriculture, which is currently constructing a new farm in neo tiew road, invested in a high-tech assembly line machinery that can automatically sort, grade, perform quality checks, disinfect and package freshly laid eggs, said mr lim. the fund paid for 70 per cent of the equipment cost.   progress towards the 2030 target, however, will need some time as farmers work out the kinks, since the use of technology is not the panacea, said miss toh of yili vegetation.   the yield of her three-hectare farm, which uses soil-grown and greenhouse methods, is limited by the space to grow asian leafy vegetables such as kangkong and spinach. her upcoming six-hectare farm in lim chu kang \u2014 yili had won the tender from sfa \u2014 will have to employ high-tech techniques to nearly triple the farm\u2019s current yield.   finding the right balance between technology and tradition remains a conundrum \u2014 it does not make economic sense to grow its current crop of asian \nvegetables, which are typically favoured by singaporeans, by using costlier high-tech methods, ms toh said.   \u201cwe got to figure out how to make the technology, which we think is still not yet mature, work for us. most high-tech indoor farms end up growing kale, not kangkong,\u201d she added.   the bigger threat of climate change   intensifying local farming is not the only way to raise production \u2014 advances in food technology raise the possibility of manufacturing novel foods, such as food substitutes and alternative proteins like impossible meats and quorn.   these innovations could pave the way to more productive and more sustainable methods of producing food. building a soy-based meat patty takes a fraction of the time, manpower, land and raw material costs of rearing an animal.   \u201ctraditional meat production methods are often land and water intensive, and generate high levels of emissions. today, alternative proteins... are poised to become game-changers,\u201d said mr masagos in the budget debate this month.   the sustainability advantages are critical as climate change is a serious challenge to singapore\u2019s food supply strategy, and is a far more profound crisis to tackle than covid-19.   \u201call around the world, we see erratic weather, changes in crop growth patterns, water shortages, and other natural and human-related disasters, sometimes all happening close to and one after another.\u00a0 population growth will further increase the stress on demand for food, at the same time when crop yields are projected to decline,\u201d mr masagos warned.   if perfected, novel food technologies could be the answer to the seeming paradox of food security: destructive land-use practices to grow food ends up putting food security at risk.   there is a rising trend in alternative lab-grown food production and high-tech, high-intensity farming around the world as well, such as indoor hydroponic vertical farms, indoor fish farms and recirculating aquaculture systems, said dr tortajada.\u00a0   a viable \nlocal agriculture industry in land-scarce singapore is therefore \u201cvery feasible\u201d.   yet, due consideration should be given if singapore wants to produce more food in-house. \u201cit is important to remember that climatological events, pests, et cetera., can decimate produce, irrespective of whether its origin is national or international,\u201d she said.   \"resilience thus comes from

His patients are missing \"not much\", they had only \"fever and from time to time a little cubble,\" says Martin Bommer. The Chief Physician of the Alb Fils Clinics takes care of two people from the district of G\u00f6ppingen, which came to the hospital with a coronavirus infection at the end of February. They belong to that patient group, which will probably survive the SARS COV 2 virus without major problems. That's a good thing, because who is currently coming to a hospital with the new Corona infection, creates physicians in front of a mystery: How to deal with such a special case? So far, this knowledge gap in Germany had no serious, so deadly consequences. Because most corona-patients have only slight symptoms. However, in some cases, infection can also trigger a heavy Covid 19-disease, pneumonia with shortness of breath, against which there is no drug. Or a vaccine, which would usually not be created. Should first very heavy disease progressions occur in Germany, and of which it is purely statistically to be assumed at some point, doctors like Martin Bommer can currently do only one thing: Patients supply with oxygen and in the worst case even artificially breathe. In fact, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), treatment with oxygen is a central measure with a heavy COVID 19 infection. Some patients in China also received cortisone preparations that can suppress immune response and inhibit inflammation in the body (NEJM: Guan et al., 2020). However, the US epidemic authority CDC warns against such treatments because they could extend the period in which the viruses multiply in the body. Even antibiotics are often administered, although they can actually combat bacterial infections. So clinicians and clinicians want to avoid that Covid-19-diseases additionally about about \ninfect with pneumococci or other bacteria. Because if the lung is already weakened by the new coronavirus, it may be fatal if they are additionally attacked by bacteria. All these measures, however, fight only the symptoms, not the cause of an infection with SARS-COV-2 itself. That's because there are no medications that could attack doctors with the new pathogen. Nevertheless, try all possible medicines to slow or even stop the spread of the virus in the body. Drug repurposing is called this: with a drug, which was originally developed against a certain disease, treat a new illness. On this method, medicinalers and physicians are reluctant, especially when the alternative was simply doing nonstun. In the past, they have already found successful therapies for diseases. The experts hope that again. If the two corona infected in the Alb Fils clinics in G\u00f6ppingen would be so ill that they would have to treat them drugs, chief physician Martin Bommer would decide for a combination of two active ingredients, which usually get HIV-infected: Lopinavir and Ritonavir. During the SARS outbreak in 2002 and 2003, the combination in the first clinical tests had been published as promising (Thorax: Chu et al., 2004). The effectiveness against coronaviruses was not pursued after the end of the outbreak. In a COVID 19 patient, which was now treated in South Korea with the two active substances, the virus number declined significantly in ejection, as well as the patient's complaints (Journal of Korean Medical Science: Lim et al., 2020). However, the authors also write that it is unclear whether that was really on the active ingredients. So far, the evidence is missing. that doctors still use the HIV combination, should have to do with it \nThat the active ingredients are available and one can estimate the side effects, ie, for example, an impairment of liver and renal function. Many of the other active ingredients that would otherwise be in question, are partly not allowed and therefore not available. So it is also at Remdesivir: The US pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences developed the active ingredient originally in response to the Ebola outbreak in 2014 in West Africa. Although he was already tested for humans who had infected with the Ebolavirus, and healthy who voluntarily reported to the test. For the broad majority, however, no drug has been admitted to the active substance. But that could happen now. However, not because of Ebola, but because of SARS-COV-2: in an American patient who had infected, medicines and doctors handed back to Remdesivir, among other things, hoping to slow the spread of the virus in the body (NEJM : Holshue et al., 2020). The patient recovered, but it can not be estimated here if that was really about Remdesivir. The fabric acts by issuing himself as a building block of the virus, and thus prevents the virus from multiplying in the body. Now REMDESIVIR should be tested not only with a few few, but in a large style: the manufacturer Gilead Sciences announced on its website that he wools with the active ingredient into the third clinical trial phase and to practice its effect on about 1,000 patients in predominantly Asian countries . If REMDESIVIR is actually inhibiting the new coronavirus and the patients have benefited from them, it would be quite certainly approved quickly, says Ralf Bartenschlager. He is Head of Molecular Virology at the University Hospital Heidelberg and researches medicines that are latitudely effective, so be used against different viruses. He holds Remdesivir for one \nPromising therapy because it could be used against different viruses. In cell cultures, it does not only affect the Ebolavirus, but also against other RNA viruses - including Coronaviruses (Nature: Warren et al., 2016). Other active ingredients would rather tested \"from despair\" against the coronavirus, says Heidelberger virologist. Because many are - in contrast to the Ebola active substance - specifically tailored to the structure of a virus. The chance that such medicines also help against Corona is \"very small\". According to Bartenschag, this applies to the HIV drugs Ritonavir and Lopinavir, but also on Oseltamivir, which is normally used against the flu. At the end of 2019, China's World Health Organization WHO reported a pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause from Wuhan. A week later, researchers identified a novel virus as the cause: they called it 2019-NCOV. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. Meanwhile, it is known as SARS COV-2 (COV stands for coronavirus, SARS for a respiratory disease triggered by a similar pathogen). SARS-COV-2 could have spread from a food market in Wuhan. There, exotic animals like reptiles were also sold. The lung disease that can trigger the new virus is now referred to as COVID-19 (English for coronavirus disease; Coronavirus disease). The disease is a so-called zoonose - a plague through a pathogen from the animal kingdom. Parts of virus bodies of SARS COV-2 same pathogens affecting bats. The new virus could have been transferred to humans via a still unknown intermediary. Both the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as well as Mers (MIDDLE East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses which have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more \nAs 750 died. With the Mers virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. In total there are several hundred types of coronaviren. Many of them affect the respiratory tract and can cause colds. Medizors and physicians assume that the virus is transmitted above all about droplet infection from person to person. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals. More than 200,000 cases of Corona worldwide (as of March 18th) were now registered. Added to this is a high number of dark figure, the researchers roughly suspect somewhere between 50 and 80 percent of all cases. Several thousand people have demonstrably died worldwide. In most, the infection is very mild. Among the deaths are mainly people with severe pre-existence and older people. The course of the registered cases in Germany can be tracked here on this map. The number of infected worldwide, which have been positively tested on Corona, shows this map of Johns-Hopkins University. That can not be said yet. The WHO announced on January 28, that about one-fifth of the persons filed as an infected persons through the virus will be severely ill, so in case of doubt should be treated intensive care. Meanwhile, the WHO classifies the disease as a pandemic. Diverse states have imposed entry and outgoing restrictions to slow the spread. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. States around the world have now reported infection cases, including Germany. Researchers are currently working on therapies and vaccination. First clinical trials with vaccines have begun, that is, a few patients are tested \nVaccination given. Oseltamivir inhibits an enzyme that ensures that an influenza virus detaches from the host cell and then penetrate further cells. Since the Corona outbreak, the active substance is also used with Covid-19 fertilizers (NEJM: Guan et al., 2020 & Jama: Wang et al., 2020). And that, although there is no reason, says bereting. In an earlier study, the effectiveness of Oseltamivir was tested against the SARS pathogen, which is closely related to the new coronavirus (Emerging Infectious Diseases: Tan et al., 2004). The medicine showed no effect there. \"So it's unclear why you are testing that at all,\" says Bartenschl\u00e4ger. But the search for treatment options does not stop here for a long time. Some doctors hope for chloroquine, an active substance that has already been developed in the thirties and later used against malaria. At least in the laboratory, Chloroquin seems to act against the new coronavirus (Cell Research: Wang et al., 2020). In an unprocessed article, a research team from China stated that the fund has even been successfully tested for more than 100 corona patients (bioscience trends: Gao et al., 2020). However, concrete results are not yet known. Also, a serum, which is gained from antibodies of ganned Covid-19 infected, could be effective in the fight against the new virus, as researchers write in the journal The Lancet (Chen et al., 2020). They suggest testing this method in clinical trials. Martin Bommer from the Alb Fils Clinics in G\u00f6ppingen could also imagine a drug that blocks the binding sites on cells that the virus normally uses to penetrate them. A similar approach pursue researchers and researchers from the German Primate Center and the Charit\u00e9 in Berlin. In an not yet concluded study, they found that \nCoronavirus can penetrate only with the help of an enzyme in human cells that the body produces itself (Cell: Hoffmann et al., 2020). In the laboratory, it has been shown that a medicament approved in Japan called Camostat mesilate, which is normally used in inflammation of the pancreas, inhibits this enzyme in the body. That in turn prevent the penetration of the virus into the cell, it says in a message from the German Primate Center. Whether it actually helps against Covid-19, the researchers have to investigate only in clinical trials. All these are only ideas - which actually work can not be estimated yet. Until enough data available to evaluate the individual therapies, it will probably take. But they make hope that doctors can already use medicines in a few months who help people with a heavy Covid 19 disease maybe save them life. The situation looks similar to vaccines. At zero, researchers do not have to do. But it will probably take many months before there is a vaccine for SARS-COV-2. Finally, the coronavirus is one that has never been investigated in a laboratory until a few months ago. Vaccines must also meet strict conditions and normally pass through different tests that can take years. And then fail. A vaccine should not only be doubtful, it may not have any serious side effects. In clinical trials, a vaccine candidate must first be tested on healthy and later only in small and then in large studies of diseases. Only in this way can drug authorities can thoroughly examine and end up. According to the Robert Koch Institute and vaccine developers, however, at least the first steps, the clinical trials on healthy, will be possible in the near future. \"That's just time and they need the laboratories \nand public authorities, \"says the biologist Benjamin Petsch. He is head of vaccine development at the company Cureevac based in T\u00fcbingen. He is part of one of the chosen teams entrusted with the development of a vaccine against SARS-COV-2. CureVac is specialized in mRNA-based vaccines. This means that your vaccine would - if it is admitted - only consist of small ingredients of the virus bodies, from which the body itself generates those virus proteins that cause the immune system to form antibodies. That is enough to prepare the body to a real infection. A similar approach also pursues the US company Moderna, which according to own information is already so far that it can already test its active substance mRNA-1273 in healthy. The approach, mRNA for one Using new vaccines is quite new. Older virus vaccines often consist of weakened or killed pathogens or contain Individual virus proteins from the surface of the viruses. On the other hand, the genome-based vaccines contain only the most entirely information that the body needs for an immune response. \"With the new generation of vaccines, the development of the active ingredients has accelerated a lot,\" says Petsch. Above all, because of mRNA vaccines, fewer quality controls are necessary. For example, in such vaccines, it should no longer be demonstrated that the pathogen is inactivated, as required in vaccines with killed pathogens. From the many years of experience with other coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, according to PETH, it is already known, at which point - so on which surface protein - should start a vaccine in the new virus. \"In addition, as likely other laboratories, we can use experiences from the development of other vaccines.\" These are all factors that significantly shorter the process of vaccine development. \nThe current vaccine search is coordinated, inter alia, from the CEPI, a worldwide alliance, which promotes vaccine projects to counteract major epidemics, such as EBOLA or COVID-19, with effective vaccines. The aim of the organization is to ensure that countries worldwide can better react to sudden outbreaks. It also supports traditional methods of vaccine development, such as a project of the University of Queensland, in which researchers are currently researching a protein vaccine against the SARS COV 2 virus. Not only thanks to the work of the CEPI, the search for a suitable vaccine could soon lead to a destination. Also, registration authorities such as the European Medicines Agency EMA have announced to accelerate the examination of resources against SARS-COV-2 - and thus effectively counteract the outbreak.

president halimah yacob was read out in parliament where she noted that singapore\u2019s hotel occupancy rate is at just 20 per cent presently.   now, hotels are gearing up to change tracks by taking in guests such as kimberley who must serve their mandatory stay-home notice.   those who are served the notice cannot leave their place of stay or residence during the period, which begins from the time they land in singapore.   some hoteliers told today that being able to take in guests serving their stay-home notice \nhas been an unexpected lifeline for them, given the gradual decline in tourist arrivals.   mr adrian siow is manager for rest bugis hotel and hotel 1888 collection in chinatown. both properties are offering their rooms at a lower fixed rate for such individuals.   he noted a \u201csmall surge\u201d in demand as well after malaysia\u2019s lockdown recently, with malaysian workers needing accommodation after they chose to stay and work here.   however, mr siow said that their stay will not be indefinite and the industry is \u201cstruggling right now\u201d.   since february, tourists who had visited mainland china have been barred from entering singapore, in a bid to prevent the spread of covid-19. this travel ban was extended to all other tourists on march 22.   minimising risk between two groups   elsewhere, to boost occupancy rates, some branded hotels have begun offering staycation deals for residents who have had to cancel overseas holiday plans, while at the same time offering their rooms for those serving stay-home notices.   several of these properties are on the singapore global network\u2019s list of hotels for people who need to serve out their notice.   they declined or did not respond to today\u2019s queries about what precautions they were putting in place to keep all guests and staff members safe from the risk of infection.   however, when this reporter posed as a potential guest at three hotels, they gave assurances that they have a system in place to minimise or even eliminate contact between those serving their stay-home notice and guests just looking for a quick getaway.\u00a0   in all instances, they said that the guests on stay-home notice are not allowed to leave their rooms at all times until the 14-day period is over.   this applies for mr siow\u2019s establishment as well.   mr siow said that regardless of which hotel such guests are staying, housekeeping staff members are not allowed to enter the room during the notice period. a \u201cdeep-cleaning\u201d process will be carried out once they \nleave, he said.\u00a0    guests on stay-home notice who have checked into\u00a0grand park orchard are provided with a greater quantity of toiletries. photo: yong jun yuan/today   employees at both jw marriott hotel and grand hyatt singapore also said that they have designated certain floors just for individuals on stay-home notice when this reporter asked as a guest.\u00a0   at the mandarin orchard hotel, an employee said that it has dedicated one of its two towers just for this purpose.   when asked what the chances were of a guest on stay-home notice checking in at the same time as a regular guest, the employee said that the chances are low because there are separate check-in counters for both categories of guests.   all three hotels also said that they have stepped up cleaning frequency within their premises.   grand hyatt, which was the among the first hotels here to receive the sg clean certification, \u201cfrequently cleans up and wipes down high touch points\u201d as well, its employee stressed.\u00a0   to obtain the certification by the national environment agency, firms must meet a checklist of seven requirements. this includes the appointment of an sg clean manager to oversee the hotel\u2019s practices, putting in place processes to monitor the health of employees, and ensuring frequent disinfection of common facilities.   dedicated hotels for returning students   aside from grand hyatt, village hotel sentosa and shangri-la's rasa sentosa resort and spa have also obtained this certification. these three hotels have all been linked to covid-19 cases before.   village hotel sentosa and shangri-la's rasa sentosa resort and spa will join a list of government-designated hotels for returning students from the united states and the uk.\u00a0   the ministry of health said that from march 26, singapore students returning from the us and uk have to serve their stay-home notice at facilities such as the hotels on the list that have agreed to dedicate their entire premises just for this purpose.   the \nministry said that it will arrange for the students to be taken directly from the airport to the hotels and the returnees will have their own room and toilet, and have all their meals provided.   all these arrangements will be provided for free.    guests serving their stay-home notice\u00a0at grand park orchard receive meals prepared by the hotel. photo: yong jun yuan/today   the full list of government-designated hotels has not been made public, but today understands that it also includes village hotel albert court, the elizabeth hotel and grand park orchard.   mr arthur kiong, chief executive officer of far east hospitality \u2014 which manages the village hotel chains and the elizabeth hotel \u2014 said that as a homegrown company, he felt that it was a \u201cnational duty\u201d to support government initiatives and help singaporeans and residents get through this covid-19 storm.   this was a sentiment shared by ms tan shin hui, executive director of park hotel group, which manages grand park orchard, located opposite paragon mall.\u00a0   both mr kiong and ms tan said that their designated hotels have several precautions in place to prepare for the arrival of these returning students.\u00a0   for instance, from now till may 31, only guests serving their stay-home notice can access the designated hotels under far east hospitality. no other guests will be accepted.\u00a0   over at grand park orchard, ms tan said that it has \u201ctaken extra precautionary measures\u201d such as providing clear segregation of entry for individuals serving the notice and for employees or the public.\u00a0    an alternative entrance for guests who are serving their\u00a0stay-home notice\u00a0at grand park

serving stay-home notice.\u00a0   employees who need to deliver food or other items will leave them by the door without meeting the guest.   mr kiong of far \neast hospitality said that upon these guests\u2019 departure, the hotels will work closely with a government-appointed vendor to clean and sanitise the rooms, which includes the use of hospital-grade disinfectant.   these precautions aside, mr kiong said that he understands the frustration and boredom that comes from being cooped up in an enclosed space for a long period of time.\u00a0   \u201cto help ease cabin fever, our staff

as covid-19 crisis damages its image. beijing \u2014 when the covid-19 epidemic began its relentless march around the world, china\u2019s diplomats reacted harshly toward countries that shut their borders, cancelled flights or otherwise restricted travel.   italy was overreacting when it did so, mr qin gang, a vice-minister of foreign affairs, told his counterpart in february. the united states was stoking fear and panic, a spokeswoman, ms hua chunying, said.   \u201ctrue feeling shines through in hardship,\u201d she said back then.   now china is doing the same, undercutting its own diplomatic efforts to win sympathy and support by imposing travel restrictions that it once called unnecessary. they include 14 days of quarantine for travellers from italy, iran, south korea and japan.   almost everyone flying into beijing faces a similar fate, regardless of departure point.   \u201cthey have a toolbox that only seems to have a hammer,\u201d said mr j\u00f6rg wuttke, the president of the european chamber of commerce in china, who is now himself in quarantine in his beijing home after returning from europe last friday.   the epidemic is first and foremost a public health crisis, having already caused more than 3,000 deaths, but for china, it has become a challenge to its standing at home and abroad, too. china faces a torrent of suspicion from other countries that could undermine its ambitions of becoming a global economic and political power.   china is now hitting back \u2014 it has expelled foreign journalists, attacked displays of racism, hinted that other governments are responding too slowly and suggested that the virus originated elsewhere. the government has hailed friendly countries that sent supplies or stayed open to chinese travellers and has also itself sent shipments of aid.   to the communist party\u2019s critics, the epidemic has confirmed the harshest critiques of the flaws in its governance, including its intensifying authoritarianism under its leader, mr xi jinping, and its \nreflex for secrecy and obfuscation.   with flights from around the world cancelled, the near-isolation of the country could well compound the anger that has already boiled over at home, especially if the epidemic has a lasting effect on trade and tourism.   it has inflamed relationships that were already tense, like that with the united states, but also strained those with friendlier countries such as russia. china has urged countries to work together but lashed out at the united states and others, at least in part, it seems, to deflect public anger at home.   \u201cthe epidemic is a lost opportunity for china to rebuild some good will with america and other countries,\u201d ms susan l. shirk, chairwoman of the 21st century china center at the university of california, san diego, wrote in an email.   \u201cbeijing is playing geopolitics with the epidemic,\u201d ms shirk wrote. \u201cthe domestic propaganda is hostile to the us and emphasising the superiority of the chinese system and the wisdom of xi jinping.\u201d   the intensity of the outbreak forced china to go on the defensive early, especially as the government failed to explain the delays in warning the public about the threat of the coronavirus, especially in wuhan, the city where it began.   \u201cwell, this is a new virus,\u201d china\u2019s foreign minister, mr wang yi, said in an interview with reuters in february when asked about the delays. \u201cso naturally it takes time for people to gain more understanding and knowledge about it. the same has happened in other countries.\u201d   the epidemic has sparked a wave of xenophobia and anti-chinese racism in japan, vietnam, australia and countries in europe and elsewhere, where some are asking if their economies are too dependent on china.   even russia, which has grown closer and closer to beijing, was among the first to shut its border and stop issuing visas, and china\u2019s ambassador, mr zhang hanhui, complained about the treatment of chinese on moscow\u2019s buses.   around the world, the epidemic has been met \nwith news coverage that questioned china\u2019s public health standards, its one-party control and its suppression of dissent. some trump administration officials and members of congress have argued that the crisis should force a more decisive reset in relations with china.   chinese diplomats have pushed back. they attacked the displays of racist sentiment and, more broadly, tried to refute criticism of how the country has handled the outbreak.   china\u2019s embassy in berlin slammed the german newsmagazine der spiegel for a cover photograph that showed a man in a protective suit and mask, with the headline \u201cmade in china\u201d.   \u201cepidemic outbreaks must not be used as an excuse for discrimination and xenophobia,\u201d the embassy\u2019s statement said.   now that the rate of new infections and deaths in china has slowed, officials are trying to portray the country as the world\u2019s leader in the fight against the coronavirus.   the central propaganda department is even publishing a book \u2014 in several languages \u2014 praising mr xi\u2019s role in guiding the country through the crisis, however premature a declaration of victory might seem at this point.   at a briefing in beijing on thursday, officials highlighted the assistance that china is now providing other countries. that includes sending coronavirus test kits to pakistan, japan, iran and other countries.   china\u2019s red cross flew a team of volunteer experts to iran, which has been particularly hard hit. it also chartered a flight to bring back chinese citizens from iran \u2014 a step it harshly criticised the united states for doing from wuhan in january.   china\u2019s foreign ministry is keeping score. mr ma zhaoxu, a vice-minister of foreign affairs, said thursday that 62 countries had donated masks or protective clothing.   myanmar provided rice, sri lanka tea. mongolia donated 30,000 sheep, a gift that coincided with an official visit last week by its president, mr khaltmaagiin battulga.

packages still want to travel somewhere,\u201d said mr jim szczesniak, manager at the anchorage airport. \u201cwhat we\u2019re working on is attracting the demand from those people who want to travel.\u201d \n the marketing initiative is geared toward travellers from australia, northern europe and the continental united states. \n \u201cwe just want people who were going to china to think of alaska as a temporary replacement for a trip they can rebook to china in the future,\u201d said ms julie saupe, president and chief executive of visit anchorage. \n officials with the airport have been in conversations with united airlines about increasing service from newark, new jersey; with delta air lines about increasing service from atlanta as well as minneapolis; and with american airlines from dallas. \n internationally, the airport is also in talks with several asian airlines, including japan airlines, korean airlines and china airlines, about increasing service from asian countries that have not been affected by covid-19. \n \u201casia is really close to alaska, about six hours from tokyo to anchorage, so there is a real opportunity for those carriers to reroute aircraft to anchorage,\u201d mr szczesniak said. \n alaska isn\u2019t the only tourist destination looking to lure tourists. an ad campaign attempts to convince americans and britons that australia is a safe alternative, and in japan, the \u201cempty kyoto\u201d campaign promises travellers that if they visit the city now, they will have some of the most popular locations to themselves. \n in a facebook video, president rodrigo duterte of the philippines encouraged people to travel around the country because \u201ceverything is safe in our country,\u201d he said. \n visit anchorage is working \u201ca little more aggressively\u201d with travel advisers, cruise providers and other tour operators to promote alaska, ms saupe said. the message is being sent through newsletters, in phone calls and at trade shows, she said. \n the effort to bring more travellers to the state is also meant to make up, somewhat, for the drop in visitors from china. \n since 2013, the number of chinese tourists to alaska has increased by more than 70 per cent, according to the alaska travel industry association, with the state\u2019s national parks and the northern lights among the main draws. \n but in recent weeks, as many cities in china are in forced lockdowns, alaska, like other tourist destinations across the world, has seen a drop in chinese visitors. \n a recent survey conducted by travel leaders network, a network of north american travel agencies, found that about 30 per cent of agencies reported \u201ca high to moderate number of cancellations for china and other parts of asia,\u201d but few cancellations for trips to europe, the caribbean, mexico, hawaii and alaska, supporting the expectation that people still want to travel, just not to asia. \n but not all travellers are sure they\u2019ll want to get on a cruise ship that might have recently been in asia. \n ms jennifer walker, a travel adviser based in illinois, said that some of her clients, who were interested in travelling to alaska over the summer, decided to change their trip and travel to the east coast of the united states because they were worried that the coronavirus could soon reach alaska. \n \u201ctheir thought is that coronavirus will likely move west to east in its spread, and when they see that the ship they were looking at has had issues like the westerdam, they ask if the ship is clean,\u201d ms walker said. \u201ci have to talk them off the ledge.\u201d \n ms saupe said that people who visit alaska from europe and australia tend to be in search of adventure, and they are usually willing to take a long trip, much like travellers who travel to asia to backpack and see sites there. \n \u201cif you\u2019re interested in the great wall and ancient sites, alaska also offers spectacular natural sites,\u201d she said. \u201cbetween the adventurous traveller and the cruise traveller, we share a lot of the same characteristics that are appealing to folks who would be visiting china.\u201d the new york times ", "label": 1}, {"content": "will coronavirus shift global investment from china to india?. economic activity has almost come to a standstill in china as major businesses and investors remain spooked about the future impact of the novel respiratory virus (2019-ncov or covid-19) outbreak, which has already claimed over 1,300 lives and caused over 48,000 infections.\ndisturbance caused by the flu-like virus has affected key sectors like global tourism, trade, manufacturing and export/import. but the biggest jolt has come from the shutdown of many businesses--from major retail chains to automobile and smartphone manufacturing firms--in mainland china.\nas a result, countries that have a high dependency on china for goods--especially small components and parts--have suffered. market experts fear that the world's over-reliance on china will continue to hurt global growth until the virus is contained.\ncommenting on the possible risks, sunil damania, cio, marketsmojo.com, said: \"there is a great danger that world economic growth could take a beating due to the virus as china accounts for 12 per cent of world's gdp growth rate.\"\n\"there could be a severe indirect impact on many producers (outside china) who source their raw materials or components from china,\" he added.\nbut with no sign of a breakthrough in containing the virus, analysts at s&p say chinese production activities are likely to remain subdued for nearly two quarters before a revival. economists also predict that the virus outbreak in china could reduce global gdp by almost 0.3 per cent.\nthis puts global growth at risk and foreign entities who have investments in china may decide to park their money elsewhere.\nspotlight on india, other ems\neconomists say the disruption caused by the virus in china could pave way for more foreign investments in emerging economies like india, bangladesh, and vietnam as the world looks to reduce

government tweaks some of its trade policies to bring down commodity prices.\nh nemkumar, head - institutional equities, iifl, said the ill-fated coronavirus outbreak in china has offered india with an opening to revive the 'make in india' programme.\nin a recent interview with the economic times, nemkumar said global companies are always looking to diversify their sources of supply and india has always been up on their radar.\nhe also gave vietnam's example which has gained a huge growth boost due to higher density of electronics manufacturing.\n\"the coronavirus outbreak in china provides a good opportunity to india to expand trade and follow an export-driven model,\" subramanian said at the indian institute of management-calcutta.\n\"india has been following the same pattern in terms of mobile manufacturing in the country. so, if one looks from this perspective, it provides a good opportunity for india,\" he added.\nhis comments come after a recent surge in order queries received by indian traders across domains. trade analysts expect more investment opportunities for emerging economies in the backdrop of the coronavirus outbreak in china.\nit now remains to be seen whether the government can ease policies and pitch india as a strong investment destination for major companies around the globe.\nmeanwhile, india also faces a series of challenges due to the coronavirus outbreak. for instance, pharma companies, mobile handset, consumer electronics and automobile sectors in india may witness lower production due to clogged supply from china.\n\"if the outbreak continues for longer than anticipated than risk will not be restricted to a few sectors, but it can hurt the overall indian economy. the sectors that would be immune will be banks, insurance, it as they will have fewer headwinds to face due to coronavirus,\" damania added.

What has happened now had feared epidemics: that the new Coronavirus spends itself out of China outside China outside of China. \"It looks like this virus is truly escaping from China and now spread quite well,\" says British epidemiologist Christopher Dye. Experts are not really surprised by this new phase of the outbreak, which now shows: in Asia, the Middle East and with Italy also in Europe. In Italy, more than 200 people have infected with the new Coronavirus SARS-COV-2, five have died. The reaction of the authorities is drastically: Schools are closed in the north of the country, the carnival in Venice was canceled, entire communities under quarantine. \"These extraordinary measures in northern Italy are crucial to curb the outbreak,\" said the boss of the European Disease Protection Agency ECDC Andrea Ammon on Sunday. \"You may need to be taken in other communities in the coming days.\" The goal: from preventing the virus from expanding too fast - to Europe and the world. If that happens when a new pathogen is spread worldwide, experts call that a pandemic. The World Health Organization WHO has so far avoid the word in its communication about the novel coronavirus SARS-COV-2. But now many experts use the \"P-Word\" when they talk about the pathogen and the pulmonary disease caused by him covid-19. Since China has reported an accumulation of unusual pulmonary inflammation at the end of December, the virus related to the SARS pathogen has spread rapidly from the family of coronaviruses. There are about 80,000 confirmed cases now, the predominant number of it in China. and scientists go out of a high number of dark figure - because with many infected only light cold symptoms \nappear. The WHO strategy to stop the outbreak was crystal clear - and Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explains them over and over again and again: the virus with all the power to fight his source in China and at the same time prevent it from faithful. The world has a chance to stop it, he will not be tired to emphasize. Most recently, he said that by VideoLink the health ministers of Africa gathered in Addis Ababa. Still, there is the chance to curb the outbreak, even if the window is slowly closing. The strategy was correct and important. \"If this virus would behave like Sars, then she would probably have worked,\" says the epidemiologist Alessandro Vespignani from Northeastern University in Boston. But SARS-COV-2 behaves differently. We know that now. The world has won by the strict quarantine measures in China and the travel restrictions valuable time. But the past week has shown that it probably can not be prevented that the pathogen spreads worldwide. On the one hand, the virus itself is: It is contagious than the flu and causes only mild symptoms that are not easy to recognize in many people. The way it has spread in hospitals, churches and cruise ships is another warning sign. There, the virus has not only spread quickly, but also far. And then there are the new cases outside of China. In Japan and South Korea, hundreds of people have now been infected. And not for all cases is clear how they have infected. This suggests that the virus could spread there in a quiet way. Even Singapore, which is widely used as a gold standard when it comes to detecting illnesses, find contact persons and thus to contain infection, has nine cases where it is not clear where they have infected. in Iran, where it officially none until Wednesday \nSingle Covid-19-Fall gave, more than 60 infections have now been registered, twelve dead are officially confirmed. According to media reports, however, 50 people could have died in Covid-19 in the city of Ghom in February. Either way, the well-known cases are likely to be the top of the iceberg, after all, researchers are currently assuming that only one of 100 infections leads to death. Also, the fact that the pathogen has already been demonstrated by Iran travelers in other countries makes it suggest that there are much more cases. How big the iceberg is really, that will show yourself in the next few days and weeks. And then of course Italy: With more than 200 cases of Covid-19, Italy reported with a great distance from the most infected in Europe. Whether this stays long, is questionable. Alessandro Vespignani uses computer models from air connections to calculate, with what probability is a pathogens spread to other countries. Even if it should remain in Italy in the current number of cases (which is to doubt), the likelihood higher than 80 percent that a traveler has already worn the virus to another place, says Vespignani. Probably a place in Europe. What is still heavier: A research group around Neil Ferguson from Imperial College in London comes to the conclusion that only a third of the travelers from China, which were infected with SARS COV-2, have also been found. \"We estimate that about two-thirds of Covid-19 cases that have been exported from China have remained undetected worldwide,\" writing the authors of the study. \"That could have led to numerous unprecedented infection chains from man to person outside of China.\" So it is obvious that the virus is already spreading to other places without we know. This does not mean that the future is prescribed. There is many things, what researchers \nAnd researchers do not know certainly: could be warmer weather to make the epidemic the garday? Will show that old medicines help against the new pathogen - may not only save life, but also to prevent infections? Could the virus be less fatal at the end than it currently seems? That has to show himself. At the moment, however, everything indicates that the outbreak is in a new phase - the phase of the pandemic. And if that is, then it's time to rethink. Then it is no longer about curbing the virus in China, but to limit the damage where it spreads. Most researchers are always assumed that it would come to it. About what that means, health authorities, experts and politicians have to speak now. Politicians must explain why the Who has not received the money so far, which requires the organization for the fight against Covid-19. By 675 million euros, the WHO asked the world, a fraction of economic damage that the virus has already caused. So far, it has received 1.2 million euros. At the end of 2019, China's World Health Organization WHO reported a pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause from Wuhan. A week later, researchers identified a novel virus as the cause: they called it 2019-NCOV. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. Meanwhile, it is known as SARS COV-2 (COV stands for coronavirus, SARS for a respiratory disease triggered by a similar pathogen). SARS-COV-2 could have spread from a food market in Wuhan. There, exotic animals like reptiles were also sold. The lung disease that can trigger the new virus is now referred to as COVID-19 (English for coronavirus disease; Coronavirus disease). The disease is a so-called zoonose - a plague through a pathogen from the animal kingdom. Parts of the virus bodies of SARS-COV-2 \nsame pathogens affecting bats. The new virus could have been transferred to humans via a still unknown intermediary. Both the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as well as Mers (MIDDLE East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses which have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more than 750 died. With the Mers virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. In total there are several hundred types of coronaviren. Many of them affect the respiratory tract and can cause colds. Medizors and physicians assume that the virus is transmitted above all about droplet infection from person to person. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals. More than 200,000 cases of Corona worldwide (as of March 18th) were now registered. Added to this is a high number of dark figure, the researchers roughly suspect somewhere between 50 and 80 percent of all cases. Several thousand people have demonstrably died worldwide. In most, the infection is very mild. Among the deaths are mainly people with severe pre-existence and older people. The course of the registered cases in Germany can be tracked here on this map. The number of infected worldwide, which have been positively tested on Corona, shows this map of Johns-Hopkins University. That can not be said yet. The WHO announced on January 28, that about one-fifth of the persons filed as an infected persons through the virus will be severely ill, so in case of doubt should be treated intensive care. Meanwhile, the WHO classifies the disease as a pandemic. various \nStates have imposed entry and outgoing restrictions to slow the spread. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. States around the world have now reported infection cases, including Germany. Researchers are currently working on therapies and vaccination. The first clinical trials with vaccines have begun, that is, a few patients are tested by testing. Experts have to explain why it should not bring much in the new phase to restrict entry or delete flights. \"If the epidemic is so widespread as we think then travel restrictions are not a particularly effective means more, because the virus is already in many places and spreads,\" says Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch. You must explain that now measures are in the first place that prevent the local spread of the virus. Even if the virus can not stop - it can be braked. Then the number of the sick rises slower, the health system is less stressed and under the line infect fewer people. Each company has to decide which steps it looks adequate and reasonable. Should schools be closed, large events can be canceled? Is it just justified to deflude whole communities, as it happens in Italy? It's not about spread panic. But about preparing the population on a scenario, which becomes more likely. If it is never needed to take these measures - all the better. But the discussion is due now. Because that is one of the ironities of a pandemic: when a virus has captured all the globe, then the local measures will be crucial.

Doctors \"had never seen a respiratory pathogen capable of being transmitted to a whole community,\" the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said this Monday. That is why the world is in \"unknown territory,\" he added, added, not failing to underline that Covid-19 may be contained, provided that the necessary measures were taken - in eight countries No new cases were recorded in two weeks, highlighted Ghebreyesus. The lack of knowledge favors the comparisons, but these should be cautious, alerting the experts. namely as regards the influenza virus, curiously called both to devalue the new coronavirus, as to argue otherwise. To draw conclusions, nothing like resorting to the facts. \"The seasonal influenza and Covid-19 are both infectious respiratory diseases but present important specificities,\" begins to clarify C\u00e1tia Caneiras, representative of the work commission of respiratory infecciology of the Portuguese Pulmonology Society. The origin of each of the diseases is distinct. In the case of the current epidemic, a virus is concerned \"with unique characteristics and which differs from the other coronaviruses - SARS and MERS - and which is also different from the influenza virus (disease caused by various types and subtypes of the influenza virus).\" Among the various designations, the new Coronavirus 2019, is also referred to as severe coronavirus 2, or SARS-COV-2 respiratory syndromation, needs also the researcher at the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Lisbon. With the caveat that Covid-19 transmission routes are still in research, in common the two viruses have the fact that they can be transmitted from person to person through droplets disseminated by an infected person, \"more often through speech, of cough or sneezing \". So far, the new coronavirus seemed to be more contagious than most of the strains of the flu. \"each \nPerson with the new coronavirus seems to infect, on average, 2.2 other people, \"while each person with seasonal flu seems to infect 1.3 other people, on average, explains C\u00e1tia Curia. Most recent data brought, however, another reading. \"The World Health Organization mentioned this Tuesday that the latest data analysis points out that Covid-19 is not transmitted in such an efficient way as the influenza virus.\" The investigator explains: \"In the flu, people can be contagious before the symptoms develop, making it difficult to control the spread of the virus, which does not seem to be the case of Covid-19\". However, while unknowing the number of people infected with coronavirus that have only very light or none symptoms, China's evidence suggests that only 1% of the reported cases have no symptoms and that most develop symptoms within two days . Similarly symptoms are concerned, usually suddenly, and which include fever, cough, myalgia (body pains), malaise and headache. Sometimes there may also be vomiting and diarrhea. Both diseases \"can evolve into varied clinical situations: asymptomatic infection to viral pneumonia, and may, in certain cases, evolve into a fatal pathology.\" A recent study with almost 140 patients at the Zhongnan Hospital at the University of Wuhan, Epicenter of the Outbreak, identified a typical pattern of symptoms associated with the new coronavirus. High fever was the main symptom, in 99% of cases, while more than half of the patients presented fatigue and a dry cough. A third referred muscle pain and respiratory difficulties. A minority complained of diarrhea and nausea, felt a day or two before these symptoms. Both coronavirus and flu are more dangerous for people over 65, who have chronic diseases or have a weakened immune system. The World Health Organization Alert, however, that the new virus causes more cases of severe \nThat seasonal flu underlines C\u00e1tia Curia. It is not known whether the new coronavirus represents a serious threat to pregnant women, while in the case of influenza the associated risks are recognized. As for children, those infected with new coronavirus tend to present light or non-existent symptoms. In the case of the flu, it proves to be more severe, especially in very young children. C\u00e1tia Caneys underlines that \"there is still no conclusive answer to this issue.\" Although currently the mortality rate of Covid-19 is considered higher than that of most influenza viruses, the true mortality rate may be similar to that of a severe seasonal flu. The first estimates of coronavirus mortality rate in China, the epicenter of the outbreak, were about 2%. There are, however, more recent studies that indicate a lower rate in China, 1.4%, refers to specialist. But \"it is believed that there may be many light cases or without symptoms that have not been detected, which would lead to an even lower coronavirus mortality rate, less than 1%.\" Antibiotics do not treat any of the viruses, as they only work in bacterial infections, it is never too much to remember. For influenza there are antiviral drugs \"approved specifically for this situation\" and \"more effective when initiated one or two days after the onset of symptoms\". For the new coranavirus there are no approved antiviral medications, although some are being tested. It is therefore done supporting treatment only: patients are medicated for the relief of symptoms as they emerge. Like influenza, Covid-19 can cause pneumonia and respiratory problems, so patients with more serious clinical situation \"may require specific hospitalization and / or specific respiratory care such as oxygen or mechanical ventilation. Most people globally developed immunity to seasonal flu, which \nIt happens in the case of Covid-19. After the occurrence of viral infections, people generally develop antibodies that combat the virus and protect them against future infections, so \"it is reasonable to assume that people who have had the new coronavirus will be immunity,\" says C\u00e1tia Curia. \"However, it is not known how long this immunity can last and if it really exists\", alert the specialist, adding that \"in case of co-existence of infection by other coronaviruses, immunity may decrease.\" Without any vaccine approved for coronavirus, a total of 20 are currently under development. Despite recent references to the possibility of temperature rise to decrease cases of Cuvid-19, the representative of the work commission of respiratory infecciology of the Portuguese Society of Pneumology underlines that, \"given a new virus is not available that allow us to infer about how climate can affect coronavirus infection. \" Additionally, C\u00e1tia Curia adds, \"although the virus declines in the spring, there is a risk of reappearance at the end of autumn, standard observed with the flu.\" ", "label": 1}, {"content": "Coronavirus: Portugal may not be prepared to contain cases, alerting experts. A group of Portuguese experts considers that Portugal may not be prepared to contain cases of the new coronavirus (2019-NCOV) that may arise. And they give an example a suspicious case, which ended up not confirm, which was not soon referred to one of the reference hospitals.\nIn an article published in the scientific journal of the Order of Doctors, the Portuguese Medical Act, Raquel Duarte, the Faculty of Medicine of Porto, Isabel Furtado, the Infection Service of the University Center of Porto, Lu\u00eds Sousa, of the Department of Public Health of ARS From the North, and Carlos Carvalho, also of this ARS and the Biomedical Science Institute Abel Salazar, make a point of the situation on the epidemic that originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan.\n\"In Portugal, contingency plans were again activated and new guidelines for health services and airports were published. However, it is possible that we are not yet prepared, even to face a suspicious case of 2019-NCOV, \"point, referring to what is being done in Portugal.\n\"The lack of preparation we witnessed dealing with a single suspicious case (fortunately not confirmed) should be used to help healthcare and services correct their mistakes and become better prepared,\" they justify. For these experts, \"these lessons have been able to have been learned for a long time after the emergencies of the H5N1 avian influenza, from the SARS, of the H1N1 pandemic [which happened in 2009 and was initially known by the A] and Mers-COV flu.\"\nOn 1 February, a suspect case was recorded that it took several hours until I was referred to the Hospital of St. John, Porto, one of the reference units to receive these cases. It was an Italian technician who had been in China and who felt bad when he was in a footwear factory in Felgueiras. The factory owner complained of lack of information and the Italian coach was several hours in an ambulance of fire department, until he was taken to the hospital.\nIn declarations provided to the public, the union of pre-hospital emergency technicians criticized the delay in disseminating standards and lack of disposable material and disinfection. At the press conference, after this episode, the Minister of Health, Marta feared, said to have met with INEM to assess the need to reformulate information and see the material available. The Secretary of State for Health, Ant\u00f3nio Lacerda Sales, added that most media already has equipment available, such as bats and masks.\nYet in the ACTA medical article, experts say that more than concern with numbers, \"we must ensure that the country is ready to contain the disease immediately after its introduction, through a suspicion or seemingly healthy contact.\"\non the question of quarantine, which was adopted in China and in several countries in the case of repatriated people - Portugal has no obligatory quarantine, but the 20 Wuhan returned citizens are in prophylactic isolation for 14 days - report that \"important concerns in Livest lawside should be considered, but the defense of public health should always take precedence. \"\nSubscribe newsletters for free and receive the best of the publicity and the deepest jobs of the public.\nThe authors of the article stress that \"the 2019-NCOV epidemic is also a test for our ability to face a threat that will be repeated over time.\" \"At a time, we must learn from our mistakes and be better prepared than before,\" they say.\nThis Wednesday, the Directorate General for Health, Grace Freitas, revealed that the Directorate-General for Health met with regional health administrations, Health Authorities, INEM, the National Health Institute Dr. Ricardo Jorge (INSA) and the National Laboratory Network to prepare a second wave of services for the event of a case escalation. The contingency plans of hospitals are also being revisited.\nThe Director-General further met with the national civil aviation authority, which was defined that airlines with direct flights from China to Portugal will be distributed on board brochures with information on the suspected cases criteria and the indication to call for SNS24 (808 24 24 24). ", "label": 1}, {"content": "WHO explains international health care. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies the outbreak of the new coronavirus as a \"health care of international scope\". That explained WHO General Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in Geneva. Thus, concrete recommendations are associated with states to curb the spread over borders as possible. With the explanation, more financial and other resources are generally released. However, the WHO see \"no reason\" for travel and trade restrictions with China despite the emergency status, said the WHO director. \"Who recommends no restrictions, but even rejects it.\" The WHO referred to a crisis meeting that the number of cases have more than tenfold within a week. Still, the number of infections outside China is relatively low, Ghebreyesus said. But you do not know what harm would cause the virus in a country with a weak health care system. The decision is not a \"mistrust vote\" against China. In the past week, the WHO had decided differently. In 2005, 196 states have agreed on international health regulations (they). Since then, the World Health Organization (WHO) has spent five times a health care of international scope (Pheic): In Bavaria, another patient has infected with the novel coronavirus from China. It is an employee of the company Webasto from the district of Starnberg, which also employs the four so far known persons concerned, as the Bavarian Ministry of Health announced. The fifth now confirmed patient lives according to the information in the district of Traunstein. The Federal Republic plans a return campaign for German citizens from the particularly difficult Metropolis Wuhan. The flight was planned for Saturday. It was certainly not on Thursday yet. Participation is voluntary. \nAccording to previous estimates, it is about 90 federal citizens. The returnees should spend 14 days on the Air Force Base Germersheim in Rhineland-Palatinate in quarantine, as first reported the newspapers of the Media House VRM. At the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities of the World Health Organization WHO reported an accumulation of pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause in the Central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the diseases. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days then a group released a group of the virologen Christian's premier from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 the first diagnostic test for the new virus, the researcher provisionally call 2019-NCOV. With the test, the virus can be detected in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, on which, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected. Both the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as well as Mers (MIDDLE East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses which have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more than 750 died. With the MERS virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronaviruses. Many of them relate to respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example. In China, several thousand persons are suffering from them, some of them - most of them with pre-existing conditions - have died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first infection cases outside of China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been in Wuhan. \nOn January 21, US authorities reported the first infection with a tourist, who came back from Wuhan, on January 24, the first cases were known in France. Meanwhile, first cases were confirmed in Germany. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. The virus can cause pneumonia that can endally end. Since it is a viral illness, antibiotics do not help. Meanwhile, it is clear that the virus can be transferred from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transfers after a dozen cases were known in medical staff. Medizors assume that the virus is transmitted above all over droplet infection. The World Health Organization calculates, as announced on January 24, at the moment that an infected one cuts 1.4 to 2.5 other people. Contest these numbers, the virus is less contagious than SARS and also the viral flu. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals. That can not be said yet. The World Health Organization said on 28 January that about one-fifth of the reported cases through the virus will be seriously ill, so in case of doubt must be treated intensive care. According to reports, the first death pots were patients who had some severe pre-existing conditions. Even with other infectious diseases, people with pre-existing diseases are particularly endangered - for example at the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so change their genome. This can cause you to become more dangerous for people in the course of an outbreak - but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institut (RKI) expects no similar to the current time \nMortality as at the outbreak of SARS. Thousands of passengers sat on Thursday because of a corona suspicion for hours on a cruise ship in Italy. A tourist from the Chinese special administrative zone Macau had complained about fever and respiratory problems on the Costa Smeralda. She and her husband were isolated and examined for the virus. More than 6,600 people were not allowed to leave the ship in the harbor in Civitavecchia. Only in the evening came the all-clear: The test results of the two were negative, shared the Ministry of Health in Rome. The passengers were allowed to land. The number of infections with the new coronavirus 2019-NCOV has meanwhile exceeded the worldwide cases of the SARS Pandemie 17 years ago. With 317 new diseases, of which the authorities of the hard-affected Province of Hubei in Central China reported on Thursday, the total number of worldwide climbed to more than 8,100. Humanly acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002/2003 after the World Health Organization, 8,096 people were ill and 774 died. Through the new virus, which is related to the SARS pathogen, 170 people have come to life. With the first illness in Tibet, China's infections are now proven in all regions and provinces. The increase is fast. Two weeks ago, only 40 cases had been counted. The highlight of the epidemic is expected at the earliest in one week. Outside the People's Republic, more than 100 infections have been counted in around 20 countries. In Germany there are five confirmed cases so far. The patients are according to Thursday without symptoms. Read an analysis here, which is why WHO has now proclaimed the International Health Night. ", "label": 1}, {"content": "china's economy skids as coronavirus paralyses factories, households. china\u2019s factory production plunged at the sharpest pace in 30 years in the first two months of the year as the fast-spreading coronavirus and strict containment measures severely disrupted the world\u2019s second-largest economy. urban investment and retail sales also fell sharply and for the first time on record, reinforcing views that the epidemic may have cut china\u2019s growth by half in the first quarter and that authorities will need to do more to restore growth. industrial output fell by a much larger-than-expected 13.5% in january-february from the same period a year earlier, data from the national bureau of statistics (nbs) showed on monday. that was the weakest reading since january 1990 when reuters records started, and a sharp reversal of the 6.9% growth in december. the median forecast of analysts polled by reuters was for a rise of 1.5%, though estimates varied widely. judging by the data, the shock to china\u2019s economic activity from the coronavirus epidemic is greater than the global financial crisis, said zhang yi, chief economist at zhonghai shengrong capital management. these data suggest a small contraction in the first-quarter economy is a high probability event. government policies would need to be focused on preventing large-scale bankruptcies and unemployment. the dire batch of official economic data on monday also showed a shocking declines in the retail and property sectors. fixed asset investment fell 24.5% year-on-year, dashing forecasts for a 2.8% rise and skidding from the 5.4% growth in the prior period. private sector investment dived 26.4% from a year earlier. retail sales shrank 20.5% on-year, compared with a rise of 0.8% tipped by analysts and 8% growth in december as consumers shunned crowded places like shopping malls, restaurants and movie theaters. china\u2019s jobless rate rose to 6.2% in february, compared with 5.2% in december and the highest since the official records \nwere published. while officials say the epidemic\u2019s peak in china had passed, analysts warn it could take months before the economy returns to normal. the fast spread of the virus around the world is also sparking fears of a global recession that would dampen demand for chinese goods. mainland china has seen an overall drop in new coronavirus infections, but major cities such as beijing and shanghai continued to wrestle with cases involving infected travelers arriving from abroad, which could undermine china\u2019s virus fighting efforts. while domestic conditions should improve slowly in the coming months, the mounting global disruption from the coronavirus will hold back the pace of recovery, said julian evans-pritchard, senior china economist at capital economics. prior to a significant deterioration in the virus, analysts had predicted a rapid v-shaped recovery for china\u2019s economy, similar to that seen after the sars epidemic in 2003-2004. however, the outbreak escalated just as many businesses were closing for the long lunar new year holidays in late january, and widespread restrictions on transportation and personal travel, as well as mass quarantine, delayed their reopening for weeks. both exports and imports fell in the first two months from a year earlier, while slumping demand pushed factory prices back into deflation. factories may not be back to full output until april, some analysts estimate, and consumer confidence may take even longer to recover. the pain in the industrial sector was also seen in china\u2019s real estate market. property investment fell at its fastest pace on record while home prices stalled for the first time in nearly five years.[b9n2ar01a] despite those numbers, nbs spokesman mao shengyong said short-term policies to support the property market were not among the government\u2019s broad swathe of stimulus options. other major global economies have more recently unleashed a wave of stimulus to prop up growth and ensure financial stability. china\u2019s \ncentral bank said on friday it was cutting the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves (rrr) for the second time this year, releasing another 550 billion yuan ($78.82 billion) to push down borrowing costs. mao from the nbs told reporters after the data release there is room for china to appropriately raise budget deficit ratio this year, and beijing would expand effective investment to cope with the economic downward pressure. china has cut several key interest rates since late january, and some analysts are expecting another reduction in its benchmark lending rate this week. it has also urged lenders to extend cheap loans to the worst-hit firms and tolerate late payments, though analysts note that will likely saddle banks with more bad loans. the government has also announced fiscal support measures, including more funding for the virus fight, tax waivers, cuts in social insurance fees and subsidies for firms. i\u2019m worried about the small firms. the pressure of rent remains a problem and tax waivers don\u2019t mean much, as there\u2019s no revenues, said hua changchun, chief economist at guotai junan securities. if q1 gdp growth turns negative, there would be huge pressure to achieve the full year target, unless we can have a 8%-10% of gdp growth in the second quarter.

digits, the leader of the governing democratic party posted a picture of himself clinking glasses for \u201can aperitivo in milan,\u201d urging people \u201cnot to change our habits\u201d.   that was on feb 27. not 10 days later, as the toll hit 5,883 infections and 233 dead, the party boss, mr nicola zingaretti, posted a new video, this time informing italy that he, too, had the virus.   italy now has more than 53,000 recorded infections and more than 4,800 dead, and the rate of increase keeps growing, with more than half the cases and fatalities coming in the past week. on saturday, officials reported 793 additional deaths, by far the largest single-day increase so far. italy has surpassed china as the country with the highest death toll, becoming the epicentre of a shifting pandemic.   the government has sent in the army to enforce the lockdown in lombardy, the northern region at the centre of the outbreak, where bodies have piled up in churches. on friday night, authorities tightened the nationwide lockdown, closing parks, banning outdoor activities including walking or jogging far from home.   on saturday night, italian prime minister giuseppe conte announced another drastic step in response to what he called the country\u2019s most difficult crisis world war ii: italy will close its factories and all production that is not absolutely essential, an enormous economic sacrifice intended to contain the virus and protect lives.   \u201cthe state is here,\u201d he said in an effort to reassure the public.   the tragedy of italy now stands as a warning to its european neighbours and the united states, where the virus is coming with equal velocity. if italy\u2019s experience shows anything, it is that measures to isolate affected areas and limit the movement of the broader population need to be taken early, put in place with absolute clarity, then strictly \nenforced.   despite now having some of the toughest measures in the world, italian authorities fumbled many of those steps early in the contagion \u2014 when it most mattered as they sought to preserve basic civil liberties as well as the economy.   italy\u2019s piecemeal attempts to cut it off \u2014 isolating towns first, then regions, then shutting down the country in an intentionally porous lockdown \u2014 always lagged behind the virus\u2019 lethal trajectory.   \u201cnow we are running after it,\u201d said ms sandra zampa, undersecretary at the ministry of health, who said italy did the best it could given the information it had. \u201cwe closed gradually, as europe is doing. france, spain, germany, the us are doing the same. every day you close a bit, you give up on a bit of normal life. because the virus does not allow normal life.\u201d   some officials gave in to magical thinking, reluctant to make painful decisions sooner. all the while, the virus fed on that complacency.   governments beyond italy are now in danger of following the same path, repeating familiar mistakes and inviting similar calamity. and unlike italy, which navigated uncharted territory for a western democracy, other governments have less room for excuses.   italian officials, for their part, have defended their response, emphasising that the crisis is unprecedented in modern times. they assert that the government responded with speed and competence, immediately acting on the advice of its scientists and moving more swiftly on drastic, economically devastating measures than their european counterparts.   but tracing the record of their actions shows missed opportunities and critical missteps.   in the critical early days of the outbreak, mr conte and other top officials sought to downplay the threat, creating confusion and a false sense of security that allowed the virus to spread.   they blamed italy\u2019s high number of infections on aggressive testing of people without symptoms in the north, which they argued only created hysteria \nand tarnished the country\u2019s image abroad.   even once the italian government considered a universal lockdown necessary to defeat the virus, it failed to communicate the threat powerfully enough to persuade italians to abide by the rules, which seemed riddled with loopholes.   \u201cit is not easy in a liberal democracy,\u201d said mr walter ricciardi, a world health organization board member and a top adviser to the health ministry, who argued that the italian government acted on the scientific evidence made available to it.   he said the italian government had moved at a much faster clip, and took the threat much more seriously, than its european neighbours or the us.   still, he acknowledged that the health minister had struggled to persuade his government colleagues to move more quickly and that the difficulties of navigating italy\u2019s division of powers between rome and the regions resulted in a fragmented chain of command and inconsistent messages.   \u201cin times of war, like an epidemic,\u201d that system presented grave problems, he said, adding that it perhaps delayed the imposing of restrictive measures.   \u201ci would have done them 10 days before, that is the only difference.\u201d   it could never happen here   for the coronavirus, 10 days can be a lifetime.   on jan 21, as top chinese officials warned that those hiding virus cases \u201cwill be nailed on the pillar of shame for eternity,\u201d italy\u2019s culture and tourism minister hosted a chinese delegation for a concert at the national academy of santa cecilia to inaugurate the year of italy-china culture and tourism.   mr michele geraci, italy\u2019s former undersecretary in the economic development ministry and a booster of closer relations with china, had a drink with other politicians but looked around uneasily.   \u201care we sure we want to do this?\u201d he said he asked them. \u201cshould we be here today?\u201d   with the benefit of hindsight, italian officials say certainly not.   ms zampa, the health ministry undersecretary, said in retrospect she would \nhave closed everything immediately. but in real time, it wasn\u2019t that clear.   politicians across the spectrum worried about the economy and feeding the country, and found it difficult to accept their impotence in the face of the virus.   most importantly, italy looked at the example of china, ms zampa said, not as a practical warning, but as a \u201cscience fiction movie that had nothing to do with us\u201d. and when the virus exploded, europe, she said, \u201clooked at us the same way we looked at china\u201d.   but already in january, some officials on the right were urging mr conte, their former ally and now political enemy, to quarantine schoolchildren in the northern regions who were returning from holidays in china, a measure aimed at protecting schools. many of those children were from chinese immigrant families.   many liberals criticised the proposal as populist fearmongering. mr conte declined the proposal and responded that the northern governors should trust the judgment of education and health authorities who, he said, had proposed no such thing.   but mr conte also demonstrated that he was taking the threat of contagion seriously. on jan 30, he blocked all flights in and out of china.   \u201cwe are the first country in europe to adopt such a precautionary measure,\u201d he said.   over the next month, italy responded swiftly to coronavirus scares. two sick chinese tourists and an italian returning from china received care from a prominent infectious disease hospital in rome. a false alarm led authorities to briefly confine passengers on a cruise ship docked outside of rome.   \u2018patient one\u2019 super-spreader   when a 38-year-old man went to the emergency room at a hospital in codogno, a small town in the lodi province of lombardy, with severe flu symptoms on feb 18, the case did not set off alarms.   the patient declined to be hospitalised and went home. he got sicker and returned to the hospital a few hours later and was admitted to a general medicine ward. on feb 20, he went into \nintensive care, where he tested positive for the virus.   the man, who became known as patient one, had had a busy month. he attended at least three dinners, played soccer and ran with a team, all apparently while contagious and without heavy symptoms.   mr ricciardi said italy had the bad luck of having a super spreader in a densely populated and dynamic area who went to the hospital not once, but twice, infecting hundreds of people, including doctors and nurses.   \u201che was incredibly active,\u201d mr ricciardi said.   but he also had not had any direct contacts with china, and experts suspect he contracted the virus from another european, meaning italy did not have an identifiable patient zero or a traceable source of contagion that could help it contain the virus.   the virus had already been active in italy for weeks by that time, experts now say, passed by people without symptoms and often mistaken for a flu. it spread around lombardy, the italian region that has by far the most trade with china and the home of milan, the country\u2019s most culturally vibrant and business-centred city.   \u201cwho we call \u2018patient one\u2019 was probably \u2018patient 200,\u2019\u201d said dr fabrizio pregliasco, an epidemiologist.   on sunday, feb 23, the number of infections clicked past 130 and italy sealed off 11 towns with police and military checkpoints. the last days of venice carnival were cancelled. the lombardy region closed its schools, museums and movie theaters. the milanese made a run on the supermarkets.   but while mr conte again commended italy for its firm hand, he also sought to downplay the contagion, attributing the high numbers of infected to lombardy\u2019s overzealous testing.   \u201cwe have been the first ones with the most rigorous and accurate controls,\u201d he said in an address to the nation. \u201cwe have more people infected because we made more swabs.\u201d   the next day, as infections surpassed 200, seven people died and the stock market plunged, mr conte and his health aides doubled down.   he blamed \nthe codogno hospital for the spread, saying it had handled things in \u201ca not completely proper way\u201d and argued that lombardy and veneto, another northern region, were inflating the severity of the problem by diverging from global guidelines and testing people without symptoms.   as lombardy officials scrambled to free up hospital beds, and the number of infected people rose to 309 with 11 dead, mr conte said on feb 25 that \u201citaly is a safe country and probably safer than many others.\u201d   on friday, mr conte\u2019s office offered an interview on the condition that he could answer questions in writing. when sent questions, including those about his past statements, he declined to respond.   mixed messages sow confusion   reassurances from leaders confused the italian population.   on feb 27, mr zingaretti posted his aperitivo picture. that same day, the country\u2019s foreign minister, mr luigi di maio, the former leader of one of the governing parties, the five star movement, held a news conference in rome.   \u201cin italy, we went from the risk of an epidemic to an infodemic,\u201d mr di maio said, disparaging media coverage that highlighted the threat of the contagion, and adding that only \u201c0.089 per cent\u201d of the italian population was quarantined.   in milan, only miles from the centre of the outbreak, the mayor, beppe sala, publicised a \u201cmilan doesn\u2019t stop\u201d campaign, and the duomo, the city\u2019s landmark cathedral that is a draw for tourists, reopened. people went out.   but on the sixth floor of the regional government headquarters in milan, mr giacomo grasselli, who is the coordinator of the intensive care units throughout lombardy, saw the numbers going up and quickly realised that it would be impossible to treat all the sick if the infections continued unabated.   his task force worked to match the sick to beds in intensive-care units in the nearest possible hospitals and appropriate dwindling resources. at one of the daily meetings of about 20 health and political officials, he \ntold the regional president, mr attilio fontana, about the growing numbers.   an epidemiologist showed the curves of infection. there was a catastrophe facing the region\u2019s well-respected health system. \u201cwe need to do something more,\u201d mr grasselli told the room.   mr fontana, who had been pressing the central government for tougher action, agreed. he said that the mixed messages from rome and the easing of restrictions had led italians to believe \u201cthat everything was a joke, and they kept living as they used to\u201d.   he said he appealed for tougher national measures in video conferences with the prime minister and other regional presidents, arguing that climbing numbers of cases threatened to collapse the hospital system in the north, but that his requests were repeatedly turned down.   \u201cthey were convinced that the situation was less serious and they did not want to hurt our economy too much,\u201d said mr fontana.   the government started providing some economic assistance, which would later be followed by a 25 billion euro (us$28 billion) relief package, but the nation became divided between those who saw the threat and those who didn\u2019t.   ms zampa said that it was around that time that government learned that infections in the town of v\u00f2, the virus epicentre of the veneto region, had no epidemiological link to the codogno outbreak.   she said that the health minister, mr speranza, and mr conte deliberated about what to do and within the day, they decided to close down much of the north.   in a surprise 2am news conference on march 8, when 7,375 people had already tested positive for coronavirus and 366 had died, mr conte announced the extraordinary step of restricting movement for about a quarter of the italian population in the northern regions that serve as the country\u2019s economic engine.   \u201cwe are facing an emergency,\u201d mr conte said at the time. \u201ca national emergency.\u201d   a draft of the decree, leaked to italian media, pushed many milan residents to rush to the train \nstation in crowds and attempt to leave the region, causing what many later considered a dangerous wave of contagion toward the south.   yet the following day, most italians were still confused about the severity of the restrictions.   to clarify the issue, the interior ministry issued \u201cauto-certification\u201d forms that would allow people to travel in and out of the locked-down area for work, health or \u201cother\u201d necessities.   in the meantime, some regional governors independently ordered people coming from the newly locked-down area to self-quarantine. others didn\u2019t.   the broader restrictions in lombardy also effectively lifted the quarantine on codogno and other \u201cred zone\u201d towns linked to the original outbreak. checkpoints disappeared. local mayors complained that their sacrifices had been wasted.   a day later, on march 9, when the positive cases reached 9,172 and the death toll climbed to 463, mr conte toughened the restrictions and extended them nationally.   but by then, some experts say, it was already too late.   local experiments   italy is still paying the price of those early mixed messages by scientists and politicians. the people who have died in staggering numbers recently \u2014 more than 2,300 in the last four days \u2014 were mostly infected during the confusion of a week or two ago.   dr roberto burioni, a prominent virologist at the san raffaele university in milan, said that people had felt safe to go about their usual routines and he attributed the spike in cases last week to \u201cthat behaviour\u201d.   the government has urged national unity in obeying its restrictive measures. but saturday, hundreds of mayors from the hardest-hit areas told the government those measures were fatally insufficient.   leaders in the north are desperate for the government to crack down harder.   on friday, mr fontana complained that the 114 troops the government deployed were insignificant, and that at least 1,000 should be sent. on saturday, he closed public offices, work sites and \nbanned jogging. he said in an interview that the government needed to stop messing around and \u201capply rigid measures\u201d.   \u201cmy idea is that if we had shut everything in the beginning, for two weeks, probably now we would be celebrating victory,\u201d he said.   his political ally, mr luca zaia, the president of the veneto region, preempted the national government with his own crackdown, and said that rome needed to enforce \u201ca more drastic isolation,\u201d including closing all stores and prohibiting public activities other than commuting to work.   \u201cwalks should be banned,\u201d he said.   mr zaia has some credibility on the issue. as new infections have proliferated around the country, they have significantly dropped in v\u00f2, a town of about 3,000 people that was one of the first quarantined and which had the country\u2019s first coronavirus death.   some government experts attributed that turnaround to the strict quarantine that had been in place for two weeks. but mr zaia had also ordered blanket tests there, in defiance of international scientific guidelines and the national government. the government has argued that testing people without symptoms is a drain on resources.   \u201cat least this slows down the virus\u2019 speed,\u201d mr zaia said, arguing that testing helped identify potentially contagious people without symptoms. \u201cand slowing down the virus\u2019 speed allows the hospitals to breathe.\u201d   if not, the overwhelming number of patients would crater health care systems and cause a national catastrophe.   americans and others, he said, \u201cneed to be read..\u201d the new

", "label": 1}, {"content": "What is known and does not know about the new deadly epidemic originating in China. The outbreak of the new coronavirus emerged in China and causes viral pneumonias has become an epidemic that spread to several countries, although it is in Chinese territory that concentrates the vast majority of cases. Here are some questions and answers on the new coronavirus, called Covid-19, based on information from the European Demost Control Center, the World Health Organization and Chinese experts and researchers. What are Coronavirus? They are a large family of viruses living in other animals (eg birds, bats, small mammals) and that in the human being usually cause respiratory diseases, from a common constipation to more severe cases such as pneumonias. Coronaviruses can transmit between animals and people. Most coronavirus strains circulate between animals and do not even infect human beings. In fact, until now, only six coronavirus strains among existing thousands is that they passed the species barrier and reached people. What is China's new coronavirus, with the name Covid-19? It is a virus of the same virus of the virus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS - which caused atypical pneumonias and reached the world in 2002-2003) and the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East in 2012. It has genetic characteristics similar to those of SARS . Can it be comparable to SARS of 2003 or the seasonal flu? SARS has caused more than 8,000 infected in 33 countries for eight months and one in ten people died of the disease. The new coronavirus has already infected almost ten times more people, but preliminary data points to a lower rate of lethality, which will be 2% to 3% at the moment. Compared to the flu virus, Covid-19, despite presenting similar symptoms, has different characteristics. Annually, about 40,000 people in the European region die prematurely every year due to causes related to seasonal flu. the Europe \nHe has not yet made any death by the new coronavirus. Until this Tuesday, there are more than 73 thousand cases in more than 25 countries and more than 1,800 deaths, three of them outside China. What is the transmission mode? The animals are the primary source of transmission, but the transmission between human beings is already confirmed. There is still not enough information on the exact forms of transmission between humans. The virus appears to be transmitted by respiratory route through cough or secretions of infected persons. The incubation period is estimated between two to 12 days, and can reach up to 14 days. There is an indication that there may be transmission of the virus even before the symptoms manifest. What are the symptoms? The main symptoms are respiratory and can be common or similar to a flu: fever, cough, respiratory distress, muscle aches and fatigue. There are patients who develop viral pneumonia and even septicemia. Are there greater risk groups? People of all ages can be affected by coronavirus. However, older people or with chronic diseases (such as asthma or diabetes) appear to be more vulnerable to have severe disease when infected. Authorities also highlight that there is still sufficient information to define people attacked more severely. A study This Tuesday disclosed by the Chinese Disease Control Center indicates that 80% of infection cases are light, which only 4.7% are considered critical and that elderly or health problems prior to infection are Reach more risks. Is treatment or vaccine? There is no specific treatment for this new coronavirus, so symptoms have been treated through support treatment (such as oxygen) and antivirals in the market, but not specific. There is also no specific vaccine and the vaccines currently available against pneumonias do not protect from this coronavirus. When should you take the specific test for the new coronavirus? in the presence of \nSymptoms of respiratory disease and if in the previous 14 days the patient has been in an affected or in contact with infected persons. The Portuguese authorities recommend that SNS24 - 808 24 24 24 - in the case of symptoms and have been in contact with patients and in an affected region. How can you prevent? Prevention is essentially through hygiene and respiratory tag measurements: frequent handwashing, avoiding close contact with people with fever or coughing and coughing or sneezing do it not for hands, but rather for elbow or forearm or for a handkerchief which should be immediately discarded. Direct contact with live animals in markets or areas affected by outbreaks and consumption of raw animal products, especially meat and eggs. Is the use of masks recommended? Protection masks help prevent the dissemination of infections and help protect those who are sick. But the use of masks does not seem to be efficient for those who are not sick. Can you travel? Are travel advised to Asia? Cases of disease reported outside China are still considered sporadic by the health authorities, with 45 cases outside this country. The WHO has not also established travel restrictions on China. There are no control of passengers from China. why? Scientific evidence shows that passenger verification at entry airports has not been effective to prevent virus dissemination. This occurs especially in cases where the disease may be present before there are developed symptoms or in cases where symptoms are common to various diseases. It is considered more effective to provide information to passengers on how to proceed in each country if they develop symptoms. Can you get charts or orders from China? Health authorities indicate that it is safe to receive orders and letters because the analyzes made demonstrate that coronavirus does not survive much time in \nobjects such as envelopes or packages. The European Demost Control Center (ECDC) further stresses that there is also no evidence of food contamination imported into the European Union, nor reported cases of transmission of the new coronavirus through food. However, there are restrictions and control to import of live animals. What is the risk for European citizens? ECDC considers that there is currently \"moderate to high\" importation of cases in the countries of the European Union / European Economic Area (EU / EEA). The probability of secondary transmission in the region, provided that appropriate prevention and control practices are met, is taken as very low. The peak of the disease has already been reached? Generally, in viral diseases, as in the case of the flu, it is only known when the peak was reached when there is consistency in the descent of the number of cases. A study Tuesday prepared by the Chinese Disease Prevention and Control Center indicates that the epidemic curve of the onset of symptoms reached the peak between 23 and 26 January, before falling until 11 February, the last date to which the study references. However, the authors also warn that the country needs to prepare for an eventual recovery of the epidemic. The pace of new cases is slow down, but it is still early to conclude if the peak of the disease was reached.

thought to have spread through civet cats - but are sometimes sold surreptitiously.   while the outbreak has rattled equity markets, the virus is likely not as deadly or infectious as sars. there are signs of spread from person-to-person, but it doesn't seem to do so easily, said takeshi kasai, world health organisation regional director for the western pacific, in an interview with bloomberg tv.   chinese authorities said that the outbreak is \"still preventable and controllable.\"   \"if this were as infectious as influenza, we would expect to see more rapid spread around china and globally,\" said raina macintyre, professor of global biosecurity at the university of new south wales. \"having said that, viruses can mutate and change during the course of an epidemic.\"   china is closely acquainted with deadly pathogens. the asian flu pandemic that emerged from wild ducks in 1957 killed as many as 2 million people \nglobally, according to the who.   sars may have spread from bats to humans via masked palm civets and other species in live-animal markets before it began infecting people.   two strains of avian flu in the past decade also may have emerged from a poultry market and a goose farm.   china has come a long way since sars, when the country was criticised for initially providing limited information and denying the scope of the problem. the epidemic revealed how poorly the nation was prepared to respond to infectious disease threats.   since then, police and market regulators have launched crackdowns on the underground trade of wild animals, prohibiting the hunting and sale of endangered, rare and protected species. the government has opened up labs and networks to identify infectious pathogens. ironically, its flagship lab is in wuhan.   still, rapid urbanisation and a dramatic increase in the movement of people and goods has meant that disease outbreak events happen every week in the west pacific region, according to a who statement.   china's vast size and population presents its policy makers with a sisyphean-like task in trying to eradicate the threat from its wet markets. the virus outbreak comes as the country also faces african swine fever, the deadly pig disease that doesn't harm humans but has devastated the pork industry.   liu yuanfei, who used to be a regular shopper at the wuhan wholesale market where the virus is suspected to have emerged, recalls seeing live crocodiles, hedgehogs and deer there. despite what's happened, he's sorry to see it shut down.   \"when some crisis happens, people start to ask why, why, why,\" said liu. \"but the existence of the market is driven by demand. as long as there's demand, even if it doesn't show up here, it will show up somewhere else.\" ", "label": 0}, {"content": "coronavirus impact: delhi shooting world cup postponed, olympic test event cancelled. the upcoming combined shooting world cup in new delhi was on friday postponed, while an olympic test event in tokyo stood cancelled due to the global novel coronavirus outbreak.\nthe tournament, sanctioned by the international shooting sport federation (issf), was to be held from march 15 to 25 in the capital's dr karni singh shooting range.\nthe olympic test event was scheduled to be held from april 16.\n\"the tournament in delhi will now be held in two parts before the olympic games. dates for the events will be announced shortly,\" a national rifle association of india (nrai) official said.\nthe decision comes after the government imposed several restrictions on the entry of travellers from affected countries such as china, italy, south korea, japan and iran, in a bid to contain the coronavirus outbreak.\nin all, 22 countries had pulled out of the event, a source in nrai told pti.\n\"while 22 was the last count till thursday night, some counties who had withdrawn, have also reapplied for visas,\" the source said.\nthe government's list of guidelines also states that the visa of all foreign nationals, who have visited the affected countries in the year 2020 and have not yet landed in india, will be cancelled.\nthe delhi event was to be a combined world cup for rifle/pistol and shotgun shooters.\nin the wake of the coronavirus, which originated in the chinese city of wuhan in december last year, many sporting events across the world have been either cancelled or postponed in recent weeks.\nlast week, india pulled out of the issf world cup in cyprus, citing the coronavirus threat.\nthe outbreak has so far claimed more than 3000 lives and infected close to 100,000 people across the world.\nthe international shooting sport federation had on wednesday announced that the world cup in delhi won't carry ranking points because athletes from all countries cannot participate following the health advisory issued by the indian government.

of delta amacuro, asked on his popular facebook account: \"will our hospital be ready for coronavirus?\"    earlier that week, as venezuela confirmed its first infections by the novel coronavirus, president nicolas maduro's health ministry on its website had listed delta amacuro's luis razetti hospital as one of 46 medical centres \"prepared\" to receive covid-19 patients.    avila enumerated various reasons, all confirmed by reuters in interviews with physicians at the hospital, why the claim was false: the facility has no blood pressure monitors, syringes, or reagents to diagnose coronavirus infections.    \"what a joke,\" avila wrote.    a day later, lizeta hernandez, governor of delta amacuro and a member of the ruling socialist party, called on local radio for avila's arrest, accusing him of \"inciting hatred\" and denouncing him as \"criminal.\" she ordered the state army deployment to detain avila \"so that i can give him a masterclass in the meaning of public duty.\"    in a voice message to reuters, the governor this week said she only wanted to \"orient\" avila and ensure he was being \"serious and responsible\" as a journalist. she declined to answer questions about the hospital, its readiness or previous clashes with avila, who for years has criticized health care in the state.    raquel ruiz, the hospital director, denied the facility is unprepared. state authorities, she added, are readying a nearby building to treat coronavirus patients.    the threat against avila, who is now in hiding but spoke with reuters by telephone, is one of at least seven recent episodes in which venezuelan authorities have sought to arrest critics of the government's preparedness for the coronavirus, according to interviews with three accused individuals and lawyers of four others.    in addition to avila, police have \narrested an opposition lawmaker who tweeted \u2013 correctly, according to health workers from the facility \u2013 that another hospital on the \"prepared\" list has no running water. police also arrested a retired medical technician who in a video said a hospital in monagas state was unprepared.    officials from venezuela's health, justice and information ministries didn't respond to requests for comment about the detentions, conditions at the hospitals or police involvement in the coronavirus response.    even in normal circumstances, dissent can subject citizens to arrest, prison sentences or worse in venezuela, where aggressive security policies have prompted western democracies to sanction the government for human rights abuses. now, government opponents say the coronavirus offers a new opportunity for maduro to crack down.    in china, where the current outbreak began, government efforts to quash early warnings about the virus may have helped it spread, public health experts have said. china denies any such cover-ups happened.    maduro's critics fear the same may happen in venezuela, where poverty, hunger and a shortage of basic medical supplies complicated health care even before the pandemic. \"the government is trying to hide the truth,\" says humberto prado, who heads a human rights commission for opposition legislators. \"if you talk, they'll arrest and silence you.\"       \"narnia world\"    as of late tuesday, venezuela has confirmed 91 covid-19 cases and no deaths.    more than 20 doctors and public health specialists told reuters they fear the toll could mount quickly despite a show of force that the government says should contain the outbreak. some of its measures are not unlike the enforced lockdowns imposed by some u.s. states and western european nations.    but the forces carrying out the tasks in venezuela have long been associated with corruption and extralegal violence. the national police's feared special action force, accused by citizens and government \ncritics of extrajudicial killings and torture, patrols streets.    intelligence agents now guard sites ranging from supermarkets to the caracas medical institute tasked with coronavirus testing. at some roadblocks, police and soldiers have shaken down medical workers before letting them get to or from work, according to 12 doctors and nurses interviewed by reuters.    one physician said she paid the equivalent of a week's salary at a checkpoint in the central city of maracay. \"the officers weren't going to let me pass,\" she said.    police officials in maracay didn't respond to a request by reuters to discuss the incident. regional military leaders, who also staff checkpoints, referred reuters to the defence ministry in caracas. officials at the defence ministry didn't return phone calls or emails requesting comment.    some police, acting on tips from neighbourhood informants, are accompanying government medics to poor neighbourhoods and forcing individuals with suspected coughs or other illnesses to get examinations, people familiar with the operations said. the administration this week said security forces had visited over 18,000 homes.    meanwhile, the government is keeping private physicians from conducting diagnoses, senior doctors told reuters, centralizing all testing at the national hygiene institute, a caracas facility that passes results directly to the health ministry.    earlier this month, the ministry stopped coronavirus testing at caracas' private el avila clinic, two medical workers familiar with the order said. on march 13, one of these people said, government workers went to the clinic and confiscated testing materials.    vicente marzullo, the clinic's director, didn't respond to efforts by reuters to discuss the government's measures there.    avila, the 54-year-old journalist in delta amacuro, has angered government officials before. a member of the native warao tribe, avila has chronicled growing health challenges for indigenous peoples \nduring venezuela's economic collapse.    in 2018, he broadcast on local radio a warao woman saying relatives were dying because of a lack of medicines. hernandez, the governor, stormed into his office afterward and accused him of spreading lies, avila said.    four physicians at the hospital on maduro's coronavirus list told reuters that avila's warnings are accurate. the doctors, who asked not to be identified, said the hospital has none of the materials avila mentioned and that, crucially, it has no ventilators, which have been vital in other countries to help covid-19 patients breathe.    \"mr. avila's comments weren't lies,\" one senior doctor said. \"the government lives in a narnia world,\" alluding to the classic fantasy epics of c.s. lewis.       \"a dangerous person\"    health-care workers in nine additional states told reuters that other hospitals on the list are also deficient.    the leopoldo manrique terrero hospital, in the coche district of caracas, isn't even open to patients. it hasn't functioned as a clinical facility for at least three years, two maintenance workers there said. reuters was unable to identify a director for the hospital or a working telephone number for administrative offices.    in northeastern monagas state, medical personnel have been so concerned about a lack of preparedness for covid-19 that they filmed a protest outside the manuel nunez tovar hospital, another facility on the list.    darwin moreno, the hospital's director, in a brief telephone conversation this week said he could discuss the incident later in the day. he didn't return follow-up phone calls or messages.    in the video, filmed march 13 and seen by reuters, julio molinos, a retired technician and medical union leader, urged the health ministry to be transparent. the video, shared widely through chat groups, reached authorities.    on march 15, officers from the special action force, or faes, arrested molinos, according to two lawyers defending him. faes \nadministrators didn't respond to a reuters request for comment on the arrest.    last week, a judge placed molinos, 72, under house arrest on charges of conspiracy and inciting hatred and panic. jose sosa, one of his lawyers, denied the charges and called molinos a \"political prisoner.\"    in the southeastern state of bolivar, tony geara, an opposition lawmaker, in a march 14 twitter thread wrote that \"there isn't even water\" at the local ruiz y paez hospital. three workers there told reuters the facility hasn't had running water for the past five years and relies on trucks to deliver it.    reuters was unable to reach hospital directors for comment.    hours after geara's tweets, agents from the sebin intelligence agency stopped the lawmaker at a roadblock, according to a report by the agency reviewed by reuters. he was arrested and remains in police custody.    at a court hearing last week, prosecutors charged geara, 58, with possession of explosives and trafficking weapons. the sebin report contains a photo of an agent pointing to an automatic rifle on the road where geara was arrested. agents said the rifle was in geara's vehicle, according to the report.    sebin officials didn't respond to a reuters request for comment. simon andarcia, geara's lawyer, said the lawmaker denied the charges and accused agents of planting the weapon.    three colleagues from geara's popular will party said sebin operatives had been tracking him recently, photographing him at political events. the government, they said, was unhappy with his criticisms and his role helping local charities distribute food and medicine.    \"the dictatorship believed these things made him a dangerous person,\" said luigi pulcini, a popular will state official, who is also geara's cousin. \"the tweets were the last straw.\" reuters ", "label":

", "label": 1}, {"content": "kenya needs to stop panicking and start preparing for coronavirus. kenyans are a worried lot. as the coronavirus outbreak continues to spread across the globe, there are increasing questions being raised about the measures - or more accurately, the lack of measures - the government is taking to protect the population. by the beginning of march, coronavirus infections had been confirmed in at least 55 countries, including three on the african continent - algeria, egypt and nigeria. while so far the continent has been spared a major outbreak, there have been dire predictions of the havoc the virus could wreak. in february, microsoft founder bill gates warned that the coronavirus disease, known as\u00a0covid-19 officially, could overwhelm already creaking health systems and claim up to 10 million lives. despite numerous false alarms, there is thankfully yet to be a confirmed case of the virus in kenya. however, a sense of panic has been building, fed largely by a perception that the government has been slow in enacting measures to prevent the virus getting into the country as well as by a dearth of public information on what to expect once its presence has been confirmed. it was not until last week that the country established a national emergency response committee to \"prevent, respond to and contain this emerging global threat\". much of the concern has centred on the continuation of flights arriving from china whose hubei province is the epicentre of the outbreak. at the end of january, the national carrier, kenya airways, reluctantly suspended flights to and from guangzhou, one of its most lucrative routes, following public pressure, including from unions. however, the government's decision to allow a china southern airlines (csa) plane carrying 239 passengers to land at the jomo kenyatta international airport on february 26 caused uproar despite assurances that the passengers had been \"screened on board, cleared and advised to self-quarantine for the next 14 days\". the \nlaw society of kenya went to court and obtained orders suspending all flights from china and requiring that the passengers of last week's csa flight be rounded up and detained at a military or specially guarded medical facility until they are certified to be free of the virus. however, focusing exclusively on measures to prevent covid-19 reaching kenya is problematic. dr ouma oluga, who heads the kenya medical practitioners and dentists union, this week told the popular sunday show, punchline, that travel bans were counterproductive and ineffective. they incentivise countries not to declare cases for fear of economic repercussions and, given the global spread of the virus, restrictions on travel from one country could not guarantee that the virus would not arrive from elsewhere. oluga cited the case in nigeria, which originated in italy, as an example of this. this is not to say that travel restrictions and other measures to contain the virus and stop it spreading, such as tracking and quarantining those infected, are not important. as both who officials and professor benjamin cowling of the school of public health at the university of hong kong have noted, such measures, while not necessarily stopping the virus, do slow it down and give countries time to prepare. and this is where kenya is failing. as public angst and government efforts concentrate on trying to prevent covid-19 getting to kenya, little attention is being paid towards preparing the health system and the public. as dr oluga pointed out, the government is yet to disseminate materials from the who to help prepare health workers to deal with the virus and, so far, most have not received \"any training at all on dealing with dangerous pathogens\". a 2013 survey of the health system found that only 2 percent of medical facilities in the country were \"providing all services required to eliminate communicable conditions\". and there is little sign that this has improved. a study published in the lancet journal \nin february noted that while kenya had a moderate risk of importing the virus from china, it had amongst the lowest scores on the continent for the capacity to handle an\u00a0outbreak. \"resources, intensified surveillance, and capacity building should be urgently prioritized in countries [like kenya] with moderate risk that might be ill-prepared to detect imported cases and to limit onward transmission,\"\u00a0it concluded. the lack of a public information campaign to educate people on what to expect and how to protect themselves is feeding the growing panic and fuelling anti-chinese sentiment which was already on the rise over allegations of racism and fears of economic exploitation. public ignorance is reflected in statements such as that from a former vice president who recently attributed the fact that no african had been diagnosed with the virus to strong genes. at the other end of the spectrum, doomsday scenarios being propagated on social media take little account of the fact that most of those who catch the virus experience only mild symptoms and that the overwhelming majority of deaths from the coronavirus have been among those aged 50 and above, a demographic that accounts for less than 11 percent of kenya's population. further, informationon how to prevent infection, for example by regularly washing hands and practising good respiratory hygiene, can and should be easily disseminated and would help calm jittery nerves.\u00a0however, instead of focusing on providing accurate and timely information to correct false narratives, the government is now threatening to prosecute people making statements it considers \"malicious and alarmist,\" a move that will do little to convince already skeptical kenyans. none of this is meant to suggest that covid-19 should not be taken seriously or that measures to prevent infected people getting into the country should be discontinued. however, rather than placing all its hopes on stopping the virus at the border, kenya's efforts should now \nbe geared towards preparing for its eventual arrival. like much of the rest of the world, it has a window of opportunity to do this. but it is a window that is rapidly closing. the views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not

Six o'clock in the evening, the temperature dropped from the day 42 to 36 degrees. Summer heat already in March - that did not exist earlier. On the streets, men and women sit in improvised tea tubes and debate about politics, bread prices and the bombs of the past morning, which the new Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok survived unhurt. That too did not exist here: talk in public as it pleases. Who was it? The disappointed Islamists? dismissed secret service? The Saudis? the American? lively discussions and a proper pinch of conspiracy theories. Every now and then one stops and looks after his car, which stands in a sheer queue. Since days there is acute fuel deficiency throughout the country. For a few liters of gas you have to spend the night in the car in front of a gas station - or just in the outdoor tea room. Petrol deficiency, inflation, bottlenecks in the supply of subsidized bread - that drives people in Khartum this evening. Not the virus. \"Sudan is still corona-free,\" had the Minister of Health Middle of Past \nWeek reported. Probably a bold statement in view of the dilapidated health system - and the rain trade and exchanges with China. On the other hand, Khartum had already established health checks at airports and borderlets as well as quarantine rooms at the end of January - that is at a time when MAN COVID-19 in Germany was still for a Chinese problem. Other African countries had reacted in a similar way to quickly. The early warning systems were already furnished, staff for episodes of epidemics trained. A consequence and teaching from the Ebola outbreaks of recent years. The youngest in the Democratic Republic of Congo was just curb. At the end of February Nigeria had identified the first Corona case in Subsahara Africa - an Italian from Milan. Also elsewhere on the continent first cases were reported, but still the numbers in Africa are amazingly low. How much can change, you can currently see in Europe. and then? \"Then we are fired.\" Lina Kafeel laughs because whining anyway. We met in the office of the Sudanese youth organization against climate change (SYOCC). If Kafeel, 35, does not work in a food company as a quality controller or is snake for anything, she plans with her fellow combatants in Khartum's streets and helps residents of the poorer neighborhood to prepare for the next floods. The coming with the rain, which has not fallen into drops here for a long time, but as made of pots, the wastewater system flows, which always triggers cholera. \"Wash hands, curb water, build better latrines,\" recommends Kafel. Advice that can help against Corona. My question, whether SYOCC also organizes Friday's for-future demonstrations, acknowledges them with a lousing smile. \"HabiBTI, we demonstrated here for more than a year for our future. Not only on Friday.\" She is chronic tired as so many \nHere, however, is still power from this revolution, in which hundreds of thousands throughout the country demonstrated day and night peacefully - although again and again was shot on them. Others with SYOCC sound more frustrated. The new transitional government has taken over a plundered state. Billion dollars of oil and gold exports have disappeared on the accounts of a small elite, the land is highly debtor, the provinces of the periphery are completely impoverished. Although Bashir is now in jail, but with its generals and warlords, the protest movement had to compromise. Nobody has seen a revolutionary dividend so far. On the contrary: The country is factile bankruptcy, the Finance Minister has no more foreign currency to pay goods on the world market: fuel, medication, spare parts. Power failures of six hours are normal. \"And when it gets hot 50 degrees in the summer,\" says Lina Kafel, \"Let's just do it.\" She makes a face like a fish snapping after air. Next to her is Mhasin Ahmed, 24, which as a child survived the war in Darfur and is now studying agriculture in Khartum. \"We have a genetic predisposition for survival strategies,\" she says. So do not be afraid of corona? The heat will protect you, believe you. and her youth. \"Apparently, especially old people die in the virus - and with us life expectancy is not so high anyway.\" 65 years, according to the World Bank. In Germany she is 80 years. That the coronavirus may not be heat, is now doubted. And the mortality rate is not only dependent on the age of the infected, but also from the state of hospitals. He is often miserable in Sudan. Outside, the sky is still yellow. A Haboob, a sandstorm, has pulled over the city and has covered everything with a dust layer. Mouthguard masks are commonplace accessory, respiratory diseases anyway. Also with the younger ones. It's my third day \nIn Khartum and Corona comes closer. The northern neighbor Egypt now records several dozen cases. About Egypt flies unamid, the UN mission for Darfur, part of her replenishment. What if the virus would spread in one of the refugee camps? 40 million inhabitants has the country, nine million are dependent on humanitarian aid. Most of the most lives in the capital, but in the impoverished periphery of the country, in the provinces of blue Nile and South Cordofan, where armed rebellions stop. Or just in Darfur, where the devastating civil war of zero years is a brittle, repressive rest. 1.6 million internally displaced life in camps, most for ten or fifteen years. Many can no longer go back to their villages because the progressive trimming by climate change has made their country unusable. Humanitarian crises mostly come in SiSpack in Sudan - and because they have been holding for so long, the outside world is hardly true. \"Here are more children malnourished and without access to school education than in Syria,\" says Abdullah Fadil. \"But no one knows that.\" Fadil is Canadian, raised in Mogadishu, his family comes from Yemen and Somalia, with crisis countries, he knows himself alone because of his origin. Since 2016 he has been conducting the Kinderhilfswerk Unicef \u200b\u200bin Sudan, organized vaccination campaigns, leaving school supplies and mobilize against the marriage of minors. He observed the 2019 revolution with a mixture of enthusiasm and admiration, and it is a mystery, why no one is trying to stabilize the country and its fragile transitional government. \"As if the international community no longer scatters around Sudan.\" Despite democracy movement and dictatorship, the Sudan is still on the US list of supporters of terrorism, which negotiations on debt relief and help through international monetary funds (IMF) and \nWorld's Bank almost impossible. Also in the times of Covid-19. \"The Sudanese do so against Corona, what they can. But the health system has no resources. There are no foreign currency to buy medical equipment. An epidemic would be an absolute disaster.\" One day later, the Ministry of Health reports the first Corona-dead, a 50-year-old Sudanese, who was probably infected with a trip to the United Arab Emirates. The man had driven his family for several days in Khartoum from hospital to hospital without anyone could diagnose his symptoms. The government closes the border crossings to Egypt, drastically limits air traffic and entry of foreigners. Among other Italians and French are no longer left into the country. States such as Ghana and Kenya have already made their boundaries for foreigners, Mauritania and Tunisia of dozens of Italian tourists, the Congo has asked German, French and Italians under quarantine. Africa expires against Europe - that too has never existed. I break my journey, creating it on one of the last flights from the country - and wonder at my arrival in Berlin, that no one measure my temperature, explaining about Corona or at least want to know where I have been. Last Sunday, the day of my return, the government in Sudan orders the closure of universities and schools for a month, prohibits sporting events, weddings and gatherings. The army against which the Sudanese had demonstrated so long is intended to enforce these measures. In the markets, the prices for mouth shift masks and vitamin C rich fruits are shooting. Shortly thereafter, the government calls for the state of medical emergency status, closes all boundaries and introduces all passenger flights. I ask about WhatsApp in the people of SYOCC, as is the situation. \"We're fine \ngood, \"is the answer. Life goes on. There is still little fuel, the government still has no foreign currency, the inflation rate is 70 percent, also in front of the bakeries are the people snake.\" If I advise the Europeans can give, \"Linah Kafeel had said in our encounter,\" just never panicked! Panic is very bad. \" ", "label": 1}, {"content": "people with no knowledge of science should not comment on coronavirus: tmc attacks bjp mp . bjp mp dilip ghosh, who recently claimed that those who eat prasad do not get coronavirus, has come under attack from trinamool congress.\ntmc secretary partha chatterjee on wednesday said that those who have no knowledge of science should refrain from commenting on issues pertaining to it. \"he [dilip ghosh] is not educated in the science of medicine. this disease is spread by a particular virus that has killed people and spread all over the world. doctors and governments are fighting really hard [to contain coronavirus]. people who are not literate enough to comment on such situations should not comment,\" partha chatterjee, a tmc mp and doctor by profession, said.\nwhile attending a religious function on tuesday, bjp mp from midnapore had claimed that coronavirus will not affect those who have had the prasad of goddess after the prayers.\nterming dilip ghosh a laughing stock, partha chatterjee said that the bjp mp should realise that he is an mp and representative of a political party. \"we all believe in god. we pray to god. but we don't have any direct communications with god, over the telephone or email as ghosh has,\" the tmc mp said.\n\"mothers and sisters travelled a long distance after fasting to offer puja. this is our culture and we see it everywhere in india. this is the identity of our country and we are progressing like this,\" dilip ghosh said on tuesday, after taking part in a puja at egra in purba medinipur district.\n\"the entire world is scared of the coronavirus and millions are staying at home. those who have conquered the whole world, reached the moon... they are scared of coming out of their homes,\" dilip ghosh added.\nthe bjp leader's comments come at a time when the virus, which first emerged in china last december, has spread to more than 100 countries, with over 4,000 deaths worldwide and over 1,10,000 confirmed cases.\n\"and look at what is happening here... thousands of people have come out to offer puja. they are drinking water and using the same hands to have the prasad... nothing will happen, they have the blessings of the almighty,\" ghosh said.\ndilip ghosh said that in india, more people die due to vector-borne diseases.\n\"...a few people have been infected (by novel coronavirus), but there is more number of deaths in the country because of malaria and dengue... we are not scared,\" the bjp mp from midnapore said.\nthe bjp leader also claimed that covid-19 outbreak in china was a form of punishment by god. \"china is wicked! they have destroyed their homeland, and it is said that nature gives the right punishment,\" he said.

country in europe to report the death of one of its own nationals from the virus, triggering travel restrictions on about a dozen towns where the number of people contaminated has continued to rise.

coronavirus consequences.\nApple will miss the only a few weeks old sales forecast for the current quarter because of the Coronavirus outbreak in China.\nFor iPhones, there are delivery bottlenecks because production in China is slowly rooted than planned, the Group said. In addition, the sales of Apple devices in China have been damped, as many shops - and also the stores of the company - were temporarily closed and badly visited.\nFor these reasons, the sales forecast issued at the end of January is no longer to be kept for this quarter of the year, it was said. Apple had already indicated an unusually wide range of 63 to 67 billion dollars, with reference to the coronavirus risks. There was no new forecast now. The restrictions for the business are only temporary, emphasized the Group.

At that time, Apple had made the weakening of the Chinese economy for weaker than expected unusual iPhone sales. In January 2019, many analysts then basically doubted the success of the iPhone business. In the Christmas quarter of 2019, however, the Group was able to clear the concerns with record numbers.\nApple is not the only electronics provider captured by coronavirus consequences.
