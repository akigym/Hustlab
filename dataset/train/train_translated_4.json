[{"content": "china services activity plunges in february as coronavirus wipes sales. beijing (reuters) - china's services sector had its worst month on record in february as new orders plummeted to their lowest level since the global financial crisis, a business survey showed on wednesday (march 4), with economists urging swift support to avoid mass bankruptcies. \n the caixin/markit services purchasing managers' index (pmi) almost halved last month to just 26.5 from 51.8 in january. it was the first drop below the 50-point margin that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis for the first time since the survey began almost 15 years ago in late 2005. \n the sharp correction suggests more urgent action is needed to support the sector, which includes many small retailers that are vulnerable to the coronavirus crisis that flared in late january. \n business activity almost ground to a halt as tens of millions were forced to stay at home amid strict travel restrictions while many restaurants, malls, and movie theatres remained closed, even as some provinces lifted curbs. \n \"stagnating consumption amid the coronavirus epidemic has had a great impact on the service sector,\" zhengsheng zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at cebm group, wrote in a note accompanying the caixin pmi release. \n the slump in the private sector survey, which focuses more on small, export-oriented companies, echoed an official survey last week, which also showed the activity falling at a record pace. \n beijing needs a robust services sector to cushion a prolonged slowdown in manufacturing and investment and create jobs for workers laid off in other areas. \n president xi jinping recently affirmed the country's determination to meet unspecified pre-set economic targets this year but analysts at nomura say high frequency data suggests output in the first quarter could slump further. \n while new confirmed virus cases have fallen notably in china, they continue to rise rapidly overseas. \n \"although policies have been introduced to provide tax and financing support for industries and small businesses heavily impacted by the epidemic, service companies were still concerned about uncertainties resulting from the epidemic,\" cebm group's zhong said. \n china's february services pmi showed the steepest decline in new work since november 2008 while outstanding orders surged to a record high as many were unable to deliver services and temporarily closed shop due to the outbreak. \n demand shrank the most at home, but new orders from overseas also fell sharply from the previous month. export demand fell the most since the sub-index started in september 2014. \n services companies shed jobs for the first time in nearly a year-and-a-half with the employment sub-index hitting its lowest ever. at the same time, some firms are struggling to recruit staff due to travel restrictions. \n to increase sales, firms have lowered prices for the third time with discounting at its most aggressive in almost eight years. meanwhile, expectations regarding the one-year outlook for business became the gloomiest since the series began in 2005. \n a china merchants bank survey of over 20,000 companies mostly in the services sector conducted in february showed nearly 20% of the companies face \"severe difficulties\" due to the coronavirus, while nearly 6% are on the brink of collapse. \n \"while the epidemic has had a more obvious effect on the manufacturing sector, it would be more difficult for service companies to make up their cash flow losses,\" cebm's zhong said. \n caixin's composite manufacturing and services pmi, also released on wednesday, slowed to a record low of 27.5 in february from 51.9 in january.

The test to Covid-19 gave positive, and this 38-year manager at Unilever became the first Italian coronavirus patient. This Monday, the Social Assistance Adviser of the Lombardy region, Giulio Gallera, announced that Mattia \"began to breathe autonomously\" and left the intensive care of the Hospital de Pavia where he is still. According to the newspaper \"La Repubblica,\" his wife, eight-month pregnant, has already returned home. Despite the favorable evolution of the first confirmed patient, Italy has become in a few days the second country with the largest number of cases and dead associated with the new coronavirus worldwide, after China. According to the latest data, there are 9,172 cases in Italy and 463 dead. In mainland China, they are counted to date 80,754 cases and 3,136 dead. At the global level, the number of cases exceeds 113,000, the dead four thousand and there are almost 64,000 recoveries. Almost a month before the start of the outbreaks the Italian Ministry of Health had created a mission group and suspended all flights from and to China, declaring an emergency state. Weeks before the test Mattia has been positive, Luigi Sacco Hospital in Milan had studied three different genetic sequences found in the Lombardy region, confirming Covid-19. So how do you explain that the increase in the number of cases and deaths have been explosive in that which is by far the most serious situation in Europe? A lane pointed out in the Italian press is that the virus has arrived in Italy before the ban on traveling. \"It is possible that when Covid-19 arrived in the country, it was still in incubation and that infection has developed in someone with light or symptom symptoms,\" explained the head of the infectious diseases of that hospital in Milan, Massimo Galli , to the newspaper \"Corriere della Serera\". Anadolu Agency / Getty Images At the end of December, an unusual number of pneumonia cases came to Codogno Hospital, the same as Mattia headed in February, according to reported the head of the emergency unit, Stefano Paglia, to the \"La Repubblica\" . Some of these patients may have been carriers of coronavirus, being treated as if they suffer from a typical winter disease. The hospital itself has been decisive in the spread of the virus due to the continuous circulation of medical staff and patients every day. \"The hospital acted as a multiplier,\" recognized Walter Ricciardi, a member of the World Health Organization Executive Council (WHO) and Consultant of the Italian Ministry of Health, in statements to Al Jazeera. Several experts attribute the initial chaos to the lack of a unified contingency plan in all regions of the country, involving public and private hospitals. The tutelage indicates that age \nMean of the deaths by coronavirus is 81.4 years. In fact, experts report that the virus is particularly dangerous for the elderly and for people with more debilitated health conditions. Asked by the Express about the Italian case, the WHO Stephanie Brickman's communication consultant preferred to begin by making a more global approach. \"Covid-19 cases are increasing due to imports and local propagation. As the contacts of infected people are screened and more and more people are tested, the number of cases increases. When a person dies of Covid-19, the moment of infection usually occurred two weeks earlier, so the increase of deaths is unfortunately a sign of evolution of the outbreak, \"she underlines her. The last figures disclosed in China and South Korea seem to indicate that the virus may be controlled - or on the way of being - in the Asian Northeast, although in the first case, in February, there has already been assisted to explosive growth in the of cases overnight. But even if this containment trend confirms in that region of the globe, cases in Europe and North America are rapidly expanding. Submitted to the most restrictive measures since World War II, the totality of the Italian population is quarantined. By announcing the extension of the measures of a considerable northern spot for the whole territory, the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, stated that \"all Italy will be a protected area.\" \"there is no time. The contagion is increasing, \"he added. It is the \"good of Italy\" that is at stake, also said, decreeing: \"habits have to be altered. Stay at home. \" Anadolu Agency / Getty Images The WHO Director General, Tedros Adhanom Ghreilyesus, has praised what he described as \"genuine sacrifices\" of Italians. According to the Government, restrictive measures will be in force until April 3. The executive promised further increase the expenses in a \"massive shock therapy\" to compensate for the economic impact of coronavirus. But through his interior minister Luciana Lamorgese also warned: Whoever leaves \"containment regions\" risks a penalty of three months and a fine by 206 euros. \"There is evidence that containment measures adopted in China slowed down the outbreak. A series of interventions will be required to help slow the propagation, including improvements in respiratory hygiene and hands and self-escape to those who are not well and who have acute respiratory diseases, \"warns Stephanie Brickman. \"WHO is always available to advise but, ultimately, Member States make decisions according to their own cultural situations and contexts,\" he adds.

for 14 days at the indo-tibetan border police's quarantine facility in chhawla, haryana. along with ashish there were other 76 indians at the camp, apart from 23 bangladeshis, one american national, two chinese and four myanmarese and five maldivian citizens. the life of a coronavirus patient can be described only in one word: depression. the patient is kept in isolation. he cannot talk to anyone. and even if you don't carry the coronavirus and are still quarantined as a suspect, you are sure shot going to go in depression. if you don't have a phone or internet access, then life will be even more of a hell. as far as food is concerned, you can eat anything cooked at home. our schedule at the itbp outpost was that we had to get up at 6.30 am and between 7 and 8 am we used to get our morning tea. and then between 8.30 am and 9.30 am we used to get breakfast. after 9.30 am we used to go for medical check-up and that used to last for one hour. our blood pressure and temperature were checked. between 12 noon and 1 pm we used to get lunch, after which we could go for a siesta. at 3.30 pm we used to get either tea or some snacks depending on availability. after that we were free and in this free time we used to watch movies or chat with friends on the internet as we were given wi-fi access. and between 8 and 9 pm we used to go for dinner. this was our daily schedule. paneer was a fixed food item on the menu for sure. either we used to get mattar paneer, shahi paneer or mushroom paneer. and for lunch it used to be one vegetable or dal. the choice of vegetables changed every day. the most fearsome thing was the testing of body temperature. one boy who was with us, his body temperature rose suddenly and so was immediately moved to the safdarjung hospital in delhi for three days. all his tests were re-done at safdarjung hospital and luckily it came out negative. the same was the case with all of us who came from wuhan. what i have learnt from my stay at the itbp camp is that the first precaution we should take is to keep away from any suspected patient. to protect oneself one must use a mask to cover the mouth, and if you don't have a mask then keep a handkerchief. if a person carrying coronavirus sneezes or coughs, if her/his spit falls on you then you will get infected. one way to prevent this is if you drink morning tea then you can put ginger in it or kaali miri in it which makes your immune system strong. this can stop coronavirus from spreading to some extent as tea with ginger makes your immune system stronger. the most dangerous way of spreading of coronavirus is metal. if a coronavirus patient holds a metal door handle the coronavirus attaches itself to it. coronavirus can easily stay alive longer on any metal. therefore, whenever you touch any metal object, then you must wash \nyour hands instantly, use a sanitiser or wash your hands with soap. train metal doors and handles are also very dangerous. there is no vaccine to cure, but the hiv vaccine can help. there is no guarantee, but china has done so and managed to save some patients, i have learnt. the worst part is that one patient can spread the virus to at least 10 people and those 10 people can in turn spread it to 100 and those 100 to another 1,000 and so on. therefore, prevention is better than cure so ensure that you follow all precautions to avoid contacting coronavirus. we were told by the itbp that if any of us had been found positive, then all of us would have to stay in quarantine for 14 days more. we all were very scared of this. if anyone sneezed by mistake then there used to be a fight. because no one wanted to add another 14 days because of just one patient. there were three south indians who sneezed and they were taken away immediately. again, thankfully, it was found out that it was because of the little weather change and therefore they were sneezing. at the end of it we all became friends. we now have friends the world over right from myanmar, maldives to china because we were on that floor at the itbp hospital. i am planning to go back to china at the end of april, to beijing. i am not tense about it because life in beijing is normal and i am getting scared in india. just now, when i sat in the car, the driver saw us wearing masks and he got scared because we had just come out of the itbp hospital. we immediately took our masks off. if not, i felt he would have asked me a lot of questions about why we were wearing the masks. i feel india is fully prepared to take on coronavirus. right now i have come to know that at the itbp camp there are 1,800 beds that have been made available. there are indians who are going to come from iran and around 5,000 of them are coronavirus suspects. the government has made good arrangements to tackle this situation. at the itbp camp, doctors have arrived from different hospitals from every state of india. they saw our camp and saw what kind of systems are in place to tackle coronavirus. they have got first-hand information and training on how to deal with suspected coronavirus cases. so i am sure india will handle the coronavirus situation well. today i am leaving the itbp centre and going back home, but i have been told by doctors that i must keep away from my ageing parents for 14 days because coronavirus is lethal for old people. i am happy that finally i will be out in the open air and breathe rather than live a quarantined life for nearly almost two months.

(reuters) - a study looking at 10 chinese children who were infected with the novel coronavirus has uncovered evidence that covid-19, the respiratory disease it causes, can appear as a less-serious infection, illustrating how difficult the infection can be to detect based only on symptoms.\nthe study led by chinese researchers, published on friday in the journal nature medicine, found that one of the children showed no symptoms at all and the rest had mild symptoms.\nthe researchers also found that the virus itself can continue to appear in fecal samples long after nose and throat swabs no longer show evidence of an infection. rectal swab testing may be a more effective way to determine how long to quarantine children, the researchers said.\nthe only reason the 10 children - six boys and four girls ranging in age from two months to 15 years - were tested at a hospital in the city of guangzhou was because they were family members of covid-19 patients or had close contact with people diagnosed with the disease, not because medical care had been sought for them, the researchers said.\nfive of the children had a cough, four had a sore throat, three had diarrhea and two had nasal congestion and runny nose, symptoms that the researchers said could can make covid-19 look like other illnesses.\n\u201cmild and atypical presentations of the infection in children may make it difficult to detect,\u201d according to the study, whose lead author was dr. yi xu of guangzhou women and children\u2019s medical center in guangzhou.\nin all, 745 children deemed as \u201chighly suspected\u201d of being infected were screened between jan. 22 and feb. 20. of that group, 1.3% were found to be infected.\nthe low ratio follows the pattern described by researchers in another study published on thursday in the new england journal of medicine in which a separate team of chinese doctors reporting out of the city of wuhan found that only 1.6% of respiratory infections among hospitalized children were covid-19. the outbreak emerged last december in wuhan and the virus has since spread to various parts of the world.\nin this latest study, seven of the 10 children had a fever, although it was never higher than 39 degrees c (102.2 f).\nnone had the pneumonia that has made the disease deadly in some adults, although ct scans showed that five of the 10 children had isolated or multiple patchy \u201cground-glass\u201d patches, usually in the outer lung fields.\nthe headache, muscle aches, nausea, lethargy, labored breathing, vomiting and disorientation that can be seen in adults who have covid-19 were all absent in this small group of infected children, the researchers said.\nthe researchers cautioned that although the virus was persistently found in the rectal swabs of eight of the 10 children even after it had vanished from nose and throat swabs, it was not clear if the virus particles present in the feces were infectious.

china's toll was just over 3,200. iran has also been hit hard, with more than 17,000 cases and 1,100 deaths. in releasing the new global infection figure of over 200,000, johns hopkins university said more than 82,000 people have recovered from the virus, which causes only mild or moderate symptoms such as fever and cough in most cases, with severe illness more likely in the elderly and those with existing health problems. scientists have no doubt the true number of people infected is higher than reported because of the possibility that many mild cases have gone unrecognized or unreported, and because of the lag in large-scale testing in the u.s., where the effort has been marked by bumbling and bureaucratic delay. in the first breakdown of its kind in the u.s., the centers for disease control and prevention said that the nation's coronavirus deaths so far mirror what has been reported in other countries, with about 4 out of 5 fatalities occurring in people 65 and older, and no deaths in children. the coronavirus is present in all 50 states after west virginia reported its first infection. in far-flung hawaii, the governor encouraged travelers to postpone their island vacations. las vegas casinos were closed for the time since president john f. kennedy's funeral in 1963.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has called on Monday an emergency committee before the progress of the new Coronavirus of Wuhan. It will meet on Wednesday to determine if it is an international emergency, to make recommendations and look for solutions to your threat. The decision comes after the confirmation of the Chinese authorities that can be transmitted between people, something that makes the disease more dangerous. Until Tuesday afternoon it has caused six mortal victims. Taiwan has confirmed his first case. Meanwhile, the Australian authorities investigate a possible case in the city of Brisbane, of a man who recently traveled to the Chinese city and that has been quarantined after showing symptoms of respiratory disease. \"The recent outbreak of a new pneumonia by Coronavirus in Wuhan and other places should be taken seriously,\" said the president of the People's Republic of China, Xi Jinping, on his first public statement on the crisis. \"The party committees, governments and relevant departments at all levels must first put the life and health of people.\" It is a new virus, which is only recorded for 20 days, so there is still much what is unknown from it. Scientists study their characteristics and expansion. This is what is known so far. Although the Wuhan authorities were assured until Friday that since January 3 there were no new infections, the reality is that they do not stop growing. According to the latest official data there are more than 300 confirmed cases. According to a statement issued on Tuesday by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, which are hospitalized there 25 have healed while 169 continues in isolation and continue to receive medical treatment. Of these, 35 are in a serious state and nine in critical state. Faced with official figures, a study by the Global Infectious Disease Analysis center of Imperial College in London estimated that, on January 12, the number of probable infections rose to 1,723. \"It is likely that the outbreak of a new coronavirus in Wuhan has caused a number of mild or moderate respiratory diseases substantially greater than it has been offered,\" said the text, produced with the support of WHO. It causes symptoms similar to those of pneumonia, causing fever and breathing difficulties, although depending on the affected person can be very mild, serious or even deadly. So far, six deaths caused by 2019-ncov, the official name of the pathogen have been registered. Details of the first two are known, which affected men, from 61 and 69 years respectively. Both suffered previous lung diseases and perished by complications derived from infection. The most direct antecedent that exists is SARS, from the same family. He was also born in China and \nIt caused the death of more than 700 people in 2002. It was deadly in approximately 10% of cases, peaning especially among those over 65. Although scientists work in unraveling their sequence, a priori believe that it is not so serious. The Coronavirus are microorganisms that mutate easily. It is suspected that they jumped to humans from a market of live animals in the town of Wuhan, since the vast majority of the first patients had been there. It is likely that the virus will pass from a primary host, such as a bat, another species for some adaptation or mutation, and that in a later one, in contact with people, reached them. In principle, it was supposed to only move from animals to humans, as well as another known pathogen of the same family: the Mers-VOC. But Chinese authorities confirmed on Monday that it can be spread among people, something that was suspecting after detecting more and more cases of infected that did not pass through the market. In the absence of knowing the conclusions of the meeting that WHO will maintain on Wednesday, in its previous evaluations, the risk of expansion has been classified as high within the country, moderately in the region and under globally. In China it has already arrived in Beijing and Shenzhen, near Hong Kong. There are rumors, likewise, that several suspected cases have been identified in Shanghai. This was exhibited by a doctor of one of the main hospitals of the city in anonymous statements to the Hongkon\u00e9s South China Morning Post: \"Our center is holding training sessions on virus prevention and treatment. You are also rushing shopping for masks, hats and disinfectants. Being sincere, I'm scared. It is a new virus with many aspects that are still not clear. \" It has already traversed four borders: it has been detected in Thailand, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.

\u201cpersonal protective equipment\u201d that can be worn by healthcare workers to prevent infection, according to a dhs official. a white house official confirmed that the administration was exploring the use of the law to spur manufacturing of protective gear. both officials requested anonymity to discuss the issue. amid a flurry of sometimes contradictory messages from washington, hhs

using the current designation for the new coronavirus, when asked about reports of \u201cdrug breakthroughs.\u201d health officials in the united states and china have set ambitious goals for getting a vaccine to initial human testing within the next few months. newer vaccine platforms, such as one developed by moderna inc (mrna.o), allow scientists to create a potential vaccine in record time just based on knowing the genetic code of the novel coronavirus. with the genetic code in hand, scientists can start vaccine development without needing a sample of the virus. anthony fauci, director of the u.s. national institutes of allergy and infectious diseases, which is using moderna\u2019s platform, said the agency is on the fastest pace ever to develop a vaccine candidate. he hopes to have a vaccine available for initial safety testing within two and a half to three months from the time scientists determined the genetic sequence of the virus. novavax inc (nvax.o) research chief gregory glenn told reuters his company has taken vaccines from discovery to clinical testing in 90 days and believes it could do something similar for the new coronavirus. but to move vaccine candidates from the lab to widespread use in patients involves a number of hurdles, according to health experts and executives for drugmakers working on coronavirus vaccines and treatments. in addition to scaling up manufacturing capacity and building distribution networks, there are regulatory hurdles such as conducting large clinical trials to make sure a vaccine not only confers immunity to the virus but is safe for use in the general population. \u201cthe earliest you could even know if it\u2019s going to work is a year,\u201d fauci said. whether even a highly effective vaccine will prove profitable for companies is another big question. \u201cthe outbreak could be abating by the time a vaccine is deemed safe,\u201d karen andersen, who follows biotech companies for morningstar, said in a research note. the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations (cepi) has raised around $800 million from donors to aid in preventing pandemic diseases and has allocated some of those funds to biotechs, including inovio pharmaceuticals inc (ino.o), moderna inc (mrna.o) and curevac, which are working on coronavirus vaccines. \u201cwe stepped into this with no economic expectation,\u201d said paul

So said Colonel Daniel Draken, Commander of the Field of Field of Defense, the image on Sunday (Bams): \"Russia has approved the overflight. But a landing on the Moscow airports was denied by reference to lack of capacities on the ground.\" According to BAMS information, Russia had prospects for the German authorities a landing. The stopover on the flight to Frankfurt is necessary to refuel the plane and exchange the pilots. An A310 crew had already flown on Thursday to Moscow to take over the machine there. Just such a crew now flew to Helsinki in the night of Saturday. On board the machine are also citizens of other nations in addition to around 90 federal citizens. The plane of the Bundeswehr landed at the early Saturday morning after a ten-hour flight in Wuhan. The US, Japan and other countries have already brought citizens from the metropolis or plan return actions. There is no one among the passengers who are infected, and no suspected cases, said Foreign Minister Heiko Maas in Berlin. Participation in the return flight is voluntary. On the way there are on board the machine on asking China's 10,000 protective suits, which would be needed on site, Maas said. After landing at Frankfurt Airport, the passengers for the incubation period of 14 days should come in quarantine. According to the Federal Ministry of Health, a central accommodation in a training boxes on the Air Force Base Germersheim is planned in Rhineland-Palatinate. This is about 100 kilometers from Frankfurt Airport. At the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities of the World Health Organization WHO reported an accumulation of pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause in the Central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the diseases. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days then a group released a group of the virologen Christian's premier from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 the first diagnostic test for the new virus, the researcher provisionally call 2019-NCOV. With the test, the virus can be detected in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, on the next fish and \nSeafood also sold exotic animals like snakes. The market was closed and disinfected. Both the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as well as Mers (MIDDLE East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses which have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more than 750 died. With the MERS virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronaviruses. Many of them relate to respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example. In China, several thousand persons are suffering from them, some of them - most of them with pre-existing conditions - have died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first infection cases outside of China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been in Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection with a tourist, who came back from Wuhan, on January 24, the first cases were known in France. Meanwhile, first cases were confirmed in Germany. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. The virus can cause pneumonia that can endally end. Since it is a viral illness, antibiotics do not help. Meanwhile, it is clear that the virus can be transferred from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transfers after a dozen cases were known in medical staff. Medizors assume that the virus is transmitted above all over droplet infection. The World Health Organization calculates, as announced on January 24, at the moment that an infected one cuts 1.4 to 2.5 other people. Contest these numbers, the virus is less contagious than SARS and also the viral flu. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals. That can not be said yet. The World Health Organization said on 28 January that about one-fifth of the reported cases through the virus will be seriously ill, so in case of doubt must be treated intensive care. According to reports, the first death pots were patients who had some severe pre-existing conditions. Even with other infectious diseases, people with pre-existing diseases are particularly endangered - for example at the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so change their genome. This can cause you to become more dangerous for people in the course of an outbreak - but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institut (RKI) \nExpects no similar mortality to the current time as the outbreak of SARS. Meanwhile, the virus continues to spread. The number of infected China rose to 11.791 until Saturday. With 46 new deaths, 259 died of pulmonary disease, as the health commission reported in Beijing. It was the strongest increase in numbers within a day. Outside the People's Republic, around 150 infections are counted in around 25 countries. The Coronavirus appeared for the first time from Germany for the first time also to Spain. The Spanish Ministry of Health confirmed an infection case on the Canary Island La Gomera. The patient, which had been isolated in a hospital because of the disease, belong to a group of five people who had contacted an infected in Germany. They all were now under the observation of the local health authorities. In Germany, where a child has been infected for the first time, the number of infected ones is now seven. The father is an infected man from the district of Traunstein. As the Bavarian Ministry of Health announced on Friday night in Munich, a man from the district F\u00fcrstenfeldbruck was also confirmed the lung disease. He works like the first five infected in Germany at the car supplier Webasto. The World Health Organization (WHO) explained the spread of the virus to a \"health care of international scope\". The 190 member countries will thus coordinate crisis measures recommended by the WHO.

a key u.s. public health agency operating inside china, as part of a larger rollback of u.s.-funded health and science experts on the ground there leading up to the coronavirus outbreak, reuters has learned. most of the reductions were made at the beijing office of the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) and occurred over the past two years, according to public cdc documents viewed by reuters and interviews with four people familiar with the drawdown. the atlanta-based cdc, america\u2019s preeminent disease fighting agency, provides public health assistance to nations around the world and works with them to help stop outbreaks of contagious diseases from spreading globally. it has worked in china for 30 years. the cdc\u2019s china headcount has shrunk to around 14 staffers, down from approximately 47 people since president donald trump took office in january 2017, the documents show. the four people, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the losses included epidemiologists and other health professionals. the material  reviewed by reuters shows a breakdown of how many american and local chinese employees were assigned there. the documents are the cdc\u2019s own descriptions of its headcount, which it posts online. reuters was able to search past copies of the material to confirm the decline described by the four people. \u201cthe cdc office in beijing is a shell of its former self,\u201d said one of the people, a u.s. official who worked in china at the time of the drawdown. separately, the national science foundation (nsf) and the united states agency for international development (usaid), the global relief program which had a role in helping china monitor and respond to outbreaks, also shut their beijing offices on trump\u2019s watch. before the closures, each office was staffed by a u.s. official. in addition, the u.s. department of agriculture(usda) transferred out of china in 2018 the manager of an animal disease monitoring program. reductions at the u.s. agencies sidelined health experts, scientists and other professionals who might have been able to help china mount an earlier response to the novel coronavirus, as well as provide the u.s. government with more information about what was coming, according to the people who spoke with reuters. the trump administration in february chastised china for censoring information about the outbreak and for keeping u.s. experts from entering the country to assist. \u201cwe had a large operation of experts in china who were brought back during this administration, some of them months before the outbreak,\u201d said one of the people who witnessed the withdrawal of u.s. personnel. \u201cyou have to consider the possibility that our drawdown made this catastrophe more likely or more difficult to respond to.\u201d the white house declined to comment or respond to \nquestions from reuters regarding the u.s withdrawal of staff in china. the cdc did not respond to detailed questions submitted by reuters about the cuts. it has insisted its staffing levels did not hinder the u.s. response to the coronavirus. \u201cthere are many factors that go into decisions around staffing,\u201d the cdc said in a statement. some health experts were skeptical that more cdc employees operating inside china would have made a difference in stemming the outbreak. beijing has been widely criticized for silencing its own public health officials who warned of a deadly new respiratory disease emanating from the chinese city of wuhan and surrounding hubei province. \u201cthe problem was china, not that we didn\u2019t have cdc people in china,\u201d said scott mcnabb, a former cdc epidemiologist who is now a research professor with emory university. he pointed to china\u2019s censorship as the main culprit in the spread of the pandemic, which has infected at least 435,470 people worldwide, killed 19,598 and upended the global economy. china\u2019s embassy in washington, d.c. declined to comment. the nsf closed all foreign offices in 2018, according to spokesman robert margetta. he said the agency planned on \u201csending teams on short-term expeditions around the world to find ways to increase international collaborations.\u201d a usaid spokesman said the decision to shutter its beijing office was \u201cdue to significantly decreased access to chinese government officials as well as the agency\u2019s position that the chinese model of development is not aligned with u.s. values and interests.\u201d the usda confirmed that it moved a manager position out of beijing. a spokesman said the department has retained an office in china that employs eight people: five americans and three chinese. the office monitors animal disease and helps resolve \u201ctrade-related issues as they occur at chinese ports of entry,\u201d the spokesman said. reuters first reported about changes to cdc staffing in china on sunday. the news agency revealed that the trump administration had eliminated the position of a u.s. trainer of chinese field epidemiologists, who were deployed to the epicenter of outbreaks to help track, investigate and contain diseases. in a press briefing on sunday, trump criticized the reuters story as \u201c100 percent wrong.\u201d yet the cdc acknowledged the position had been cut. the agency said the decision was made because of china\u2019s \u201cexcellent technical capability,\u201d and said the elimination of that post did not hamper the u.s. effort to respond to the coronavirus outbreak. the cdc staffing documents newly reviewed by reuters show a sharp decline in the overall number of employees at the agency in beijing, with 33 out of 47 positions lost. the documents show the breakdown between american and chinese staffers. the number of so-called american \u201cassignees\u201d declined to three positions from eight at the outset of the administration. positions lost included medical epidemiologists and other experts in infectious \ndiseases. the biggest cuts were to positions filled by chinese employees on the u.s. payroll, down to around 10 from 40 over the same period. many of those local hires included medical and disease experts, according to the people who spoke with reuters. \u201clocal staffers stayed even longer at the cdc and had a real depth of knowledge,\u201d one of the people said. \u201cthere\u2019s a loss of deep expertise and institutional knowledge.\u201d the cdc told reuters the three americans currently on staff in china are a country director, an influenza expert and an information technology expert. a temporary deputy director arrived recently, and that job will be filled permanently, the agency said in a statement. in addition, two chinese staffers continue to work on specific public health areas, including the training program, according to the statement. the shuttered usaid and nsf offices in china also had a role in building scientific relationships and combating global disease, according to the four people familiar with the situation. usaid\u2019s beijing office, which was staffed by a senior u.s. officer and two chinese employees, was working on initiatives including multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and malaria, the people said. the office closed in 2019. the nsf office was once led by nancy sung, a respected american scientist who was a key link between the u.s. and chinese scientific communities, according to the u.s. government official who spoke with reuters. the office also employed two local staffers. \u201cshe had far more contacts than most of us,\u201d said the official, who had been in china at the time and was familiar with her role. \u201cshe could have helped maintain vital channels of communication between the two countries which to this day is greatly curtailed.\u201d sung, who is now with the nsf in the united states, declined to comment about the closure of her office in 2018 and referred questions to the agency\u2019s public affairs office. the changes came amid escalating tensions between washington and beijing. trump has long complained that china has stolen millions of american jobs and intellectual property, charges the chinese government has rejected as baseless. the countries have slapped billions in tariffs on each other\u2019s goods. now their leaders are battling to control the narrative over the pandemic. trump has called it the \u201cchinese virus\u201d to keep the focus on china\u2019s role in unleashing the pandemic. china, meanwhile, is trying to assert global leadership by providing aid to italy and other hard-hit countries. over the last two years, the white house has pushed u.s. agencies with a presence in china to de-fund programs there along with the positions to manage them, according to the u.s. official who spoke to reuters. the source said terry branstad, the u.s. ambassador to china and a former republican governor of iowa, tried to remind the white house of the importance of the u.s. presence in china but was told to \u201cget with the program\u201d by an administration official. \u201cthe \nwhite house saw the relationship as one-sided and without benefit to the u.s.,\u201d the source said. branstad did not immediately respond to a request for comment. after reuters\u2019 story about the elimination of the key cdc position in china ran on sunday, trump\u2019s re-election campaign seized on it for fundraising. in a mass email to supporters, it accused trump\u2019s critics of

a woman in her 80s living in kanagawa prefecture near tokyo. the death was the third outside mainland china, after two others in hong kong and the philippines. japan is one of the worst affected of more than two dozen countries and territories outside mainland china that have seen hundreds of infections from the flu-like sickness. figures due out on monday are expected to show japan\u2019s economy -

", "label": 1}, {"content": "covid-19: how south korea flattened curve. new york \u2014\u00a0no matter how you look at the numbers, one country stands out from the rest: south korea.   in late february and early march, the number of new coronavirus infections in the country exploded from a few dozen, to a few hundred, to several thousand.   at the peak, medical workers identified 909 new cases in a single day, feb 29, and the country of 50 million people appeared on the verge of being overwhelmed. but less than a week later, the number of new cases halved. within four days, it halved again \u2014 and again the next day.   on sunday (march 22), south korea reported only 64 new cases, the fewest in nearly a month, even as infections in other countries continue to soar by the thousands daily, devastating health care systems and economies. italy records several hundred deaths daily; south korea has not had more than eight in a day.   south korea is one of only two countries with large outbreaks, alongside china, to flatten the curve of new infections. and it has done so without china\u2019s draconian restrictions on speech and movement, or economically damaging lockdowns like those in europe and the us.   as global deaths from the virus surge past 15,000, officials and experts worldwide are scrutinising south korea for lessons. and those lessons, while hardly easy, appear relatively straightforward and affordable: swift action, widespread testing and contact tracing, and critical support from citizens.   yet other hard-hit nations did not follow south korea\u2019s lead. some have begun to show interest in emulating its methods \u2014 but only after the epidemic had accelerated to the point that they may not be able to control it any time soon.   president emmanuel macron of france and prime minister stefan l\u00f6fven of sweden have both called south korea\u2019s president, mr moon jae-in, to request details on the country\u2019s measures, according to mr moon\u2019s office.   the head of the world health organization (who), dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus, has hailed south korea as demonstrating that containing the virus, while difficult, \u201ccan be done\u201d. he urged countries to \u201capply the lessons learned in korea and elsewhere\u201d.   south korean officials caution that their successes are tentative. a risk of resurgence remains, particularly as epidemics continue raging beyond the country\u2019s borders.   still, mr scott gottlieb, a former commissioner of the food and drug administration, has repeatedly raised south korea as a model, writing on twitter, \u201csouth korea is showing covid-19 can be beat with smart, aggressive public health.\u201d   lesson 1: intervene fast, before it\u2019s a crisis   just one week after the country\u2019s first case was diagnosed in late january, government officials met with representatives from several medical companies. they urged the companies to begin immediately developing coronavirus test kits for mass production, promising emergency approval.   within two weeks, though south korea\u2019s confirmed cases remained in the \ndouble digits, thousands of test kits were shipping daily. the country now produces 100,000 kits per day, and officials say they are in talks with 17 foreign governments about exporting them.   officials also swiftly imposed emergency measures in daegu, a city of 2.5 million where contagion spread fast through a local church.   \u201csouth korea could deal with this without limiting the movement of people because we knew the main source of infection, the church congregation, pretty early on,\u201d said dr ki mo-ran, an epidemiologist advising the government\u2019s coronavirus response. \u201cif we learned about it later than we did, things could have been far worse.\u201d   south koreans, unlike europeans and americans, were also primed to treat the coronavirus as a national emergency, after a 2015 outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) in the country killed 38.   the coronavirus is thought to have a five-day incubation period, often followed by a period of mild symptoms that could be mistaken for a cold, when the virus is highly communicable. this pattern creates a lag of a week or two before an outbreak becomes apparent. what looks like a handful of cases can be hundreds; what looks like hundreds can be thousands.   \u201csuch characteristics of the virus render the traditional response, which emphasises lockdown and isolation, ineffective,\u201d said mr kim gang-lip, south korea\u2019s vice health minister. \u201conce it arrives, the old way is not effective in stopping the disease from spreading.\u201d   lesson 2: test early, often and safely   south korea has tested far more people for the coronavirus than any other country, enabling it to isolate and treat many people soon after they are infected.   the country has conducted over 300,000 tests, for a per capita rate more than 40 times that of the us.   \u201ctesting is central because that leads to early detection, it minimises further spread and it quickly treats those found with the virus,\u201d ms kang kyung-wha, south korea\u2019s foreign minister, told the bbc, calling the tests \u201cthe key behind our very low fatality rate as well\u201d.   though south korea is sometimes portrayed as having averted an epidemic, thousands of people were infected and the government was initially accused of complacency. its approach to testing was designed to turn back an outbreak already underway.   to spare hospitals and clinics from being overwhelmed, officials opened 600 testing centers designed to screen as many people as possible, as quickly as possible \u2014 and keep health workers safe by minimising contact.   at 50 drive-thru stations, patients are tested without leaving their cars. they are given a questionnaire, a remote temperature scan and a throat swab. the process takes about 10 minutes. test results are usually back within hours.   at some walk-in centres, patients enter a chamber resembling a transparent phone booth. health workers administer throat swabs using thick rubber gloves built into the chamber\u2019s walls.   relentless public messaging urges \nsouth koreans to seek testing if they or someone they know develop symptoms. visitors from abroad are required to download a smartphone app that guides them through self-checks for symptoms.   offices, hotels and other large buildings often use thermal image cameras to identify people with fevers. many restaurants check customers\u2019 temperatures before accepting them.   lesson 3: contact tracing, isolation and surveillance   when someone tests positive, health workers retrace the patient\u2019s recent movements to find, test \u2014 and, if necessary, isolate \u2014 anyone the person may have had contact with, a process known as contact tracing.   this allows health workers to identify networks of possible transmission early, carving the virus out of society like a surgeon removing a cancer.   south korea developed tools and practices for aggressive contact tracing during the mers outbreak. health officials would retrace patients\u2019 movements using security camera footage, credit card records, even gps data from their cars and cellphones.   \u201cwe did our epidemiological investigations like police detectives,\u201d dr ki said. \u201clater, we had laws revised to prioritise social security over individual privacy at times of infectious disease crises.\u201d   as the coronavirus outbreak grew too big to track patients so intensively, officials relied more on mass messaging.   south koreans\u2019 cellphones vibrate with emergency alerts whenever new cases are discovered in their districts. websites and smartphone apps detail hour-by-hour, sometimes minute-by-minute, timelines of infected people\u2019s travel \u2014 which buses they took, when and where they got on and off, even whether they were wearing masks.   people who believe they may have crossed paths with a patient are urged to report to testing centres.   south koreans have broadly accepted the loss of privacy as a necessary trade-off.   people ordered into self-quarantine must download another app, which alerts officials if a patient ventures out of isolation. fines for violations can reach us$2,500 (s$3,600).   by identifying and treating infections early, and segregating mild cases to special centres, south korea has kept hospitals clear for the most serious patients. its case fatality rate is just over 1 per cent, among the lowest in the world.   lesson 4: enlist the public\u2019s help   there aren\u2019t enough health workers or body-temperature scanners to track everybody, so everyday people must pitch in.   leaders concluded that subduing the outbreak required keeping citizens fully informed and asking for their cooperation, said mr kim, the vice health minister.   television broadcasts, subway station announcements and smartphone alerts provide endless reminders to wear face masks, pointers on social distancing and the day\u2019s transmission data.   the messaging instills a near-wartime sense of common purpose. polls show majority approval for the government\u2019s efforts, with confidence high, panic low and scant hoarding.   \u201cthis public trust has \nresulted in a very high level of civic awareness and voluntary cooperation that strengthens our collective effort,\u201d mr lee tae-ho, the vice minister of foreign affairs, told reporters earlier this month.   officials also credit the country\u2019s nationalised health care system, which guarantees most care, and special rules covering coronavirus-related costs, as giving even people with no symptoms greater incentive to get tested.   is the korean model transferable?   for all the attention to south korea\u2019s successes, its methods and containment tools are not prohibitively complex or expensive.   some of the technology the country has used is as simple as specialised rubber gloves and cotton swabs. of the seven countries with worse outbreaks than south korea\u2019s, five are richer.   experts cite three major hurdles to following south korea\u2019s lead, none related to cost or technology.   one is political will. many governments have hesitated to impose onerous measures in the absence of a crisis-level outbreak.   another is public will. social trust is higher in south korea than in many other countries, particularly western democracies beset by polarisation and populist backlash.   but time poses the greatest challenge. it may be \u201ctoo late,\u201d dr ki said, for countries deep into epidemics to control outbreaks as quickly or efficiently as south korea has.   china turned back the catastrophic first outbreak in hubei, a province larger than most european countries, though at the cost of shutting down its economy.   south korea\u2019s methods could help the us, though \u201cwe probably lost the chance to have an outcome like south korea\u201d, mr gottlieb, the former fda commissioner, wrote on twitter. \u201cwe must do everything to avert

It may be helpful in the face of managers to toilet paper in supermarkets, thefields of breathing masks and other hysterical reactions to the global spread of the coronavirus, if a president tries to calm the population. Trump's repeated assessments, no one must worry, but have a different quality. They lead to a recklessness, while long care is offered. They give rise to security where there are no. They expose people and markets to an additional risk as if everything was already bad enough. What the country is expecting is described quickly because it should come everywhere. The health authority CDC warns: Many will infect themselves, of which 15 to 20 percent seriously ill, there will still be much more dead, all this can no longer be prevented. Or better: It was never really completely to prevent. Why Trump's first response to the Corona outbreak was quite correct: strict entry restrictions. Above all, they aim to delay the arrival of the pandemic and to win time. But this time did not use Trump. possibly even because he believes himself, what he says in the microphones, that this virus was \"not so big matter\" and he did everything they need - yes, that the crisis is made only by his opponents, so that the economy bursts, To harm him. There are even reports, after which the president fears, journalists could try to stack him. Nevertheless, he shakes further every hand, which is headed to him. And he wants to continue to cheer in the election campaigns of thousands. Trump's focus is completely clear despite all the truths: he recognized that the Corona crisis threatens his re-election and he fights with the means available to him. What would be necessary, he is completely off. He can not be the president who trusts the population in this crisis, overcomes political cleavage with leadership, because it goes larger these days. Trump does not even recognize which chance he missed: you think of pictures of politicians in rubber boots, which in election years in flood areas giving the makers - he would have made this crisis early to his priority, it certainly did not harm him. Instead, Trump acts how to do autocrats: he puts the facts in question, argued with questionable numbers, keeps information back, attacks the media that proclaims bad news, trying to suppress professional assessments and to spend its own ranks as truth. Only a few examples: the white house, reports the news agency AP, stopped the health experts from, older and thus particularly endangered citizens \nBefore air travel to warn, probably not to strain on the industry. An annual assessment of intelligence services through the worldwide threat to the USA, which was already on the agenda in Congress, was canceled: The Time Magazine reported in which report would warn the US continues to be well prepared for a global pandemic - like Already in the years before. TRUMM's untenable assertion: Allen who need a test on the virus, he is also available - which is still not true after initial problems. And the confession: \"I like the numbers as they are right\" - the president obviously has no interest in the fact that as much as possible tested and the spread is documented; More cases would mean that there may be reason for worry. Trump seems to believe he can control the action when knocking a few sayings and supplies the right pictures that accuses Democrats and their voters, again and again fake news and conspiracy calls - that has often worked. Otherwise, among other things, the official action procedure against this president would probably pass different. But to curb Corona is not enough if the Republicans join in and applaud the base. And even if Trump besides all the contradictory and bizarre performances still one or the other reasonable measures: he is basically fighting for himself and can only lose. For far too many Americans will follow his role model and do not stick to the facts, they will distrust any reputable reporting and the warnings of health experts - and therefore make bad decisions, so increase the infection speed. Or you see through him and see the land slip into the crisis, because this president does not grown the virus - which at least the economy is already in panic. Trump plays the Corona risk and wants to give the picture of a perfect crisis manager because he wants to calm the markets above all. But who bakes him that makes a serious mistake. Many Americans are difficult anyway to haul sick even to work. As long as the state does not drive dramatically, hardly anyone will be voluntarily stayed at home, who is not lucky enough to be able to easily change the home office. Much too few people were tested to know how far the virus is already widely used in the US.

At the end of 2019, China's World Health Organization WHO reported a pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause from Wuhan. A week later, researchers identified a novel virus as the cause: they called it 2019-NCOV. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. Meanwhile, it is known as SARS COV-2 (COV stands for coronavirus, SARS for a respiratory disease triggered by a similar pathogen). SARS-COV-2 could have spread from a food market in Wuhan. There, exotic animals like reptiles were also sold. The lung disease that can trigger the new virus is now referred to as COVID-19 (English for coronavirus disease; Coronavirus disease). The disease is a so-called zoonose - a plague through a pathogen from the animal kingdom. Parts of virus bodies of SARS COV-2 same pathogens affecting bats. The new virus could have been transferred to humans via a still unknown intermediary. Both the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as well as Mers (MIDDLE East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses which have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more than 750 died. With the Mers virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. In total there are several hundred types of coronaviren. Many of them affect the respiratory tract and can cause colds. Medizors and physicians assume that the virus is transmitted above all about droplet infection from person to person. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals. More than 200,000 cases of Corona worldwide (as of March 18th) were now registered. Added to this is a high number of dark figure, the researchers roughly suspect somewhere between 50 and 80 percent of all cases. Several thousand people have demonstrably died worldwide. In most, the infection is very mild. Among the deaths are mainly people with severe pre-existence and older people. The course of the registered cases in Germany can be tracked here on this map. The number of infected worldwide, which have been positively tested on Corona, shows this map of Johns-Hopkins University. that \nnot yet say. The WHO announced on January 28, that about one-fifth of the persons filed as an infected persons through the virus will be severely ill, so in case of doubt should be treated intensive care. Meanwhile, the WHO classifies the disease as a pandemic. Diverse states have imposed entry and outgoing restrictions to slow the spread. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. States around the world have now reported infection cases, including Germany. Researchers are currently working on therapies and vaccination. The first clinical trials with vaccines have begun, that is, a few patients are tested by testing.

coronavirus outbreak in china, india's toy industry has been badly hit. traders have no way to replenish dwindling stocks as they are too dependent on the neighbouring country for their supplies. since electronic components are also mostly imported from china, indian manufacturers of battery-operated toys or toys containing battery-operated parts are also in trouble. \"the epidemic has affected toy business in the country as most stockists import from china. the import of toys is zero now with stockists, distributors and retailers dependent on products left in their warehouses. the situation will remain the same for the next four to five weeks,\" said satish sundra, the owner of an old toy shop in delhi's connaught place. unless china resumes production, and fresh consignments reach indian shores, there is a medium-term production and supply crisis. \"china factories were shut for new year from the first week of january. the last time we loaded our containers (not just for toys sector, but in general) was perhaps on january 15. containers shipped from china must have already reached india. there will be no more arrivals for another three months now,\" vipin nijhawan, vice-president, toy association of india (tai) said. nijhawan, a prominent-delhi based toy importer and manufacturer, said almost 70 per cent of his stocks are sold out. \"if you don't have enough varieties (of toys) you cannot sell, so it is a bit difficult to sell the balance. even if everything goes well in china, next stocks will start arriving only by april-end or the first week of may. till then we will have a supply constraint,\" he said. this problem is the same with every importer, but the toy industry, given its heavy dependence on china, is more vulnerable. global market research firm imarc estimates india's toy market to be worth $1.5 billion (over rs 10,000 crore). there is no way to corroborate the numbers as the toy industry is largely un-organised in india. what we do know is that india imported toys worth rs 2,127 crore in 2018-19. almost 90 per cent of that was from china. another rs 93 crore worth of toys came from hong kong during the same time. considering that retail prices of imported products are often several multiples of invoice prices, imarc may not be too off the mark in its estimates. retail prices jump  the immediate causality of this over dependence on china is an increase in prices. delhibased retailers say the price of almost every toy has been hiked 30 to 40 per cent after the outbreak of coronavirus in china. nijhawan said, \"traders know they will not get fresh stocks in the next two to three months. that is why they are selling at higher prices. demand is still there, the problem is with supply,\" he said. the government has also done its bit to increase prices in the country. finance minister nirmala sitharaman, in union budget 2020-21, increased customs duty on \nall imported toys by 200 per cent -- from 20 per cent to 60 per cent. this resulted in protests from across all major trading hubs of the country. kolkata traders shut down their business for a day in protest. mumbai traders complain the duty hike will lead to the closure of small retail businesses. \"in the last two years, we have seen the import duty on toys has been increased by around 500 per cent. this step will make toys unaffordable for customers, decreasing the sales tremendously and adversely affecting the livelihood of millions of people employed in the toy industry across india,\" said abdullah sharif, vice- president of united toys association, mumbai. there is also a move to make safety standards more stringent for toys that are sold, imported or made in india. debasree chaudhuri, minister of state for women & child development, has gone on record over the government's plans to notify a \"quality control order\" for toys imported and manufactured in india. though the government has assured that safety standards

china. the virus, which originated in china, has killed about 1,900 people in that country and has spread to several other countries prompting the world health organisation (who) to term it a \"global

After last Thursday the first two cases were detected abroad - in Thailand and Japan -, this weekend Chinese authorities have confirmed a new wave of infections in Wuhan and the first three positives in other cities of the country. Also a new mortal victim, the third deceased to date because of this strange ailment. South Korea, on the other hand, has confirmed on Monday its first case the number of infected has skyrocketed in Wuhan, the city in the center of China that is considered the origin of the outbreak. The Municipal Health Commission has reported that a third person died on Saturday because of the mysterious virus, which causes symptoms similar to those of a pneumonia, causing fever and respiratory difficulties. The death of him joins that of two other men, 61 and 69 years respectively. Both suffered lung diseases in advance and perished by the complications derived from the infection. The local authorities have detailed that 136 new positives have been detected -59 on Saturday and 77 on Sunday-, which increases the total number of cases confirmed to date in 198. The Municipal Commission defended last week that there had been no new week Cases since January 3, implying that the situation was controlled, and that the transmission between humans seemed unlikely, although it could not be discarded completely. The World Health Organization (WHO) has corroborated the latest data through its Twitter account, although it has attributed them to the increase in information available on the virus. \"This [the new cases] is the result of a greater search and testing of 2019-ncov [official name of the coronavirus discovered two weeks ago] among patients suffering from respiratory diseases.\" \"WHO is proposing studies on the new Coronavirus that can be carried out in China and anywhere else to better understand the transmission, risk factors and the origin of the virus. These works will require time and resources, \"the institution added in a subsequent publication. At the same time, the China National Health Commission has revealed the detection of three other new infections, the first in domestic territory outside of Wuhan: two in the capital Beijing and another in Shenzhen, a population facing Hong Kong from continental soil. But this might not be everything. There are rumors, likewise, that several suspected cases would have been identified in Shanghai. This was presented by a doctor of one of the main hospitals of the city in anonymous statements to the Hongkon\u00e9s South China Morning Post. \"Our center is carrying out training sessions on virus prevention and treatment. You are also rushing shopping for masks, hats and disinfectants, \"he said. \"Being sincere, I'm scared. \nIt is a new virus with many aspects that are still not clear. \" The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention published on Saturday a statement through its website and social networks, in which it stressed that this new virus \"is not SARS\", an epidemic originated in China and that ended with life From more than 700 people worldwide between 2002 and 2003. The center also dismissed the \"rumors\" that aim that health centers outside of Wuhan could be offering in secret treatment infected with the virus. Sunday, the National Chinese Health Commission joined a text in which it called calm, characterizing the situation as \"predictable and controllable\", while recognizing necessary \"a close follow-up to discover new mutations.\" The publication of the Center has generated more than 5,000 comments at Weibo -Red Social China similar to Twitter - a majority of them expressing concern at the development of events. \"Have not they found the source of the infection and dare to proclaim that the epidemic is under control? Anyone who has a minimum of medical knowledge knows that the most serious thing that can occur in these situations is that the source is not located, \"a user wrote. The investigations of the authorities have pointed a fish and seafood market from the first moment in Wuhan, where the virus would have transmitted from one animal to several people. The area has been quarantined for several weeks, although it is not ruled out that there may be other foci. Many other messages were alerted from the proximity of the Chinese New Year, celebration that will take place next Saturday, January 25 and famous for constituting the world's greatest human migration with more than 3,000 million displacements. \"The dates are approaching and Wuhan is a great knot of transport, I hope that everyone pays attention to protect themselves,\" said another Internet. Both China and the rest of the countries of the region have begun to extreme security measures at airports and train stations. Some disseminated images this morning in social networks show a team of medical personnel wearing protection equipment and reviewing, one by one, the body temperature of the passengers of a plane that left the city of Wuhan. Some comments, likewise, have reacted with skepticism, distrusting the veracity of official information. Although the Chinese government has greatly improved its reaction with respect to the management of SARS, an epidemic held in secret for weeks, there are still reasonable doubts about the transparency of the data: while new cases came to light abroad, the number of infected It remained, until this weekend, stable within its borders. A recent study prepared by the Global Infectious Disease Analysis of the Imperial College in London estimated that, as of January 12, the \nNumber of probable infections rose to 1,723. \"It is likely that the outbreak of a new coronavirus in Wuhan has caused a number of mild or moderate respiratory diseases substantially greater than it has been offered,\" said the text, produced with the support of WHO.

", "label": 1}, {"content": "What is known about the symptoms of CovID-19. Just a bit cold? Nothing tastes more? No more breathing for breathing? An infection with the new coronavirus is not the same for all people. For the one it feels like a cold, for others it will be life-threatening or even deadly. General statements on the typical disease course are not possible, explains the Robert Koch Institut (RKI) in Berlin. About half of the people who have infected, they would not notice that recently RKI boss Lothar Wieler said, \"We do not see them at all.\" About the complaints of the recognized infected infected are now from several countries and increasingly from Germany data before. Some affected also report themselves how they are with SARS-COV-2. An overview of the characteristics: rather mild courses without hospitalization: from the infected, which remember something, according to RKI four of five mild courses. Cough (54 percent) and fever (40 percent) included data from more than 22,000 patients in Germany to the most common symptoms as Wieler said. \"It is a rumor that a SARS COV-2 infection definitely does not cause a cold,\" says Martin Witzenrath from the Clinic for Infectiology and Pneumology of the Charit\u00e9 Berlin, where, according to his information, more than 20 patients with differently serious progressions are treated . The FDP politician Alexander Graf Lambsdorff said the Heidelberger \"Rhein-Neckar-Zeitung\", the disease was wavy with him. He had a cold for some time, then cough was added. The symptoms he described as \"little spectacular\". How about 100 people in the particularly affected Kreis Heinsberg in North Rhine-Westphalia in domestic isolation, teams have asked for the Bonn virologen Hendrik Streeteck: \"The most commonly described symptom was dry irritants with 70 percent, before the loss of taste and Odder with 68 percent and fatigue with 68 percent, \"he says. But also many of a \"running nose\", head, muscle and sore throat and fever reported many diseases. \"Some were very beautiful K.o.,\" says the scientist. Even diarrhea was not rare, so Streeck. According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO), mild disease courses last two weeks. The disease will start after the previous experiences with gross scratches or pain and often fever, so Streeck. And how many colds. Are there any signs that you can clearly differentiate Covid-19? \"The only thing that does not cause flu, is this taste and odor loss,\" says Streeck. Otherwise, with mild progresses: \"It's like a flu infection. The affected people would not have noticed the infection with SARS-COV-2 at all. \"Chief physician Clemens Wendtner from the Clinic for Infectiology in Munich Clinic Schwabing, the first infected in the end of January \nGermany also reported that, for example, ill people could not smell and taste a few days and taste the taste of food - although their desired dish - found as metallic or bitter. According to Wendtner, the impairment can occur right at the beginning and a first indication of a disease. Also at SARS one was assumed that the virus also refers to smell receptors in the nose. Heavier courses with hospital treatment: how many people in Germany are or were in the hospital overall for Covid-19 in the hospital, is not yet known. At just under 56,000 cases recognized in China, 14 percent was difficult. At six percent, the course was critical to life-threatening, for example due to lung failure. Like WHO, serious courses can take on average between three and six weeks. In patients with symptoms of upper respiratory tract permanently, there are four to eight days after the previous experiences to decide if the disease also fails the lower respiratory tract, Witzenrath says about the Charit\u00e9. But there are also patients who directly get a pneumonia without previously affected the upper respiratory tract. Illuminated lung tissue means that the oxygen uptake is not working so well anymore. Italian doctors portrayed that there are partly patients in the strongly affected country, which will visit a clinic too late. RKI boss Wieler said on Wednesday, when you feel increasing breathlessness, it applies to consult a doctor. The disease in CovID-19 differs significantly from the previously known pneumonia, Witzenrath says. \"The special thing about it is, the patients have a little bit of air, not dramatic, they have the impression that is not particularly ill. Then you look at the lungs in the CT and that looks very bad. It's something we do not know so far. \"For example, more than half the lungs could be damaged by the virus. The course can then deteriorate rapidly. The physician calls alarm signals: \"If you go up a staircase that you otherwise cope with loosely, and remember after half, you will not get any air anymore, should that be thoughtful. Especially if you are older, pre-existing patients. \"Relatives could keep an eye on the respiratory rate of suffering: while the patient lies in front of the TV, one can - best of this unnoticed - observe how many times the chest lifts. \"If the number is in peace over 20 or 22 per minute, this is definitely a warning signal.\" Some Covid-19 patients could first be treated on normal stations, says Witzenrath. \"For example, people who support some oxygen supporting a small plastic tube under the nose, and patients whose pre-disease deteriorates under pneumonia,\" explains the physician. Meaning patients even more oxygen, get up \nIntensive stations also used a certain oxygen therapy (high flow). If that is no longer sufficient, a ventilation is necessary by a hose in the trachea, but patients are put into the coma. \"However, it can come to complications with the duration of intubation,\" says Witzenrath. According to previous data, it is assumed that those affected must be ventilated on average 17 days on intensive care stations. \"That's very, very long.\" How high the proportion of patients who need to be breathing, experts can be said, even because of the dark figure of unpressed infections, so far. The RKI calls for China: 2 to 6 percent. (DPA) ", "label": 1}, {"content": "arizona man dies after taking chloroquine for coronavirus.

Actionism in the Great laminates that there is a lack of activities in the small one: the other five men, in any case, who shared a room with David, are said to be the Moscow Times of the \nDoctors have been asked to tell anyone about that they had to divide a room. Other patients with corona suspicions complain according to reports of the Russian Radio Echo Moskwy about Miese states in said hospital for infectious diseases: suspected cases and already patients ran around in the same corridors, they share a dirty toilet, it lacks breathing masks. All the more amazing are the official information on the spread of the virus: since the end of January in two Chinese in Russia Corona has been demonstrated, the number of patients are supposedly hardly increased: so far only seven people have been positively tested. Although the border has been closed to China, but the state airline Aeroflot continues to fly to China, South Korea and Italy, if not so often. Meanwhile, the economy suffers immensely: the oil price falls, the rubles thus too. If the euro still cost 70.85 rubles on 3 February, it is 74.4 rubles a month later. A permanently low oil price would be a tremendous problem for the state budget, the Russian economy and the many promises that Putin had recently made the Russians. Panic is still little felt. In the always overturned metro, a few people wear breathing masks, which is initially not untypical and secondly can also associate with the flu wave. In the shops, the shelves are full as always. There is nothing missing. Really nothing? A small self-experiment in a few pharmacies in the Moscow city center results: breathing masks are all out of print. But there is enough disinfectant. In Spain, the Coronavirus has a growing fan base - at least on social networks like Twitter. There is an anonymous fun bird among the Twitter account @ coronavid19 Comments on the general location - from the view of the virus: \"This week I put sick write-offs on Tenerife\" or \"no desire to work? Here is my PayPal account\". Founded in a good week, the account, which introduces itself in the short biography with \"I am pandemic\", is already on a scared half million followers - and flushes on Twitter with half a dozen other so-called viruses: the lack of attention suffering \"Ordinary flu\" @Gripe_com - for example. Tasteless, such jokes hardly find someone in Spain. On the contrary: fatalistic humor is considered a proven recipe of crisis management. At least in Barcelona is a little felt of hysteria in everyday life. While disinfectants are silent and mouthguard masks sold out in many Spanish pharmacies, but the Ramblas, the main shopping street in Barcelona, \u200b\u200bare just as full as the restaurants - still. After now 229 infections and two deaths are known, the government has slightly tightened the prevention measures: football and basketball games with teams from risk zones find behind \nClosed door instead, doctors congresses were canceled for the time being to protect the medical personnel from infection. For light illness, the authorities also prescribe on the Iberian peninsula domestic isolation, heavier and the first known cases will continue to be stationary. A prominent case is Nil Monr\u00f3: The 22-year-old Influencer from Barcelona was tested after visiting the Milan Fashion Week with a slight fever and sore throat on Covid-19. Result: positive. Since then, he has reported via social media regularly from the university hospital about his disease history. He warns not to steal facial masks, always nice to wash their hands and to give up racist statements related to origin and spread of the virus. So he is almost something like an embedded coronavirus rapporteur - and fulfills this role as prudent and untrained that there was already explicit praise from the Spanish Ministry of Health. Also with @ coronavid19, the fake account of the corona pathogen, had Nil Monr\u00f3 direct contact - and briefly retired his self-confident \"I am viral\" with the comment: \"And I am, I'm that now?\" While the streets of Beijing continues to be blurred, most of the shops are closed and public events are prohibited, the supermarkets of the 20 million metropolis are already back to the usual busy normality. With vastly exciting full bags, most customers leave the shops, especially younger Chinese cover themselves with dozens of bags and cans. Since the end of last year, the Coronavirus has already been ratting in China, but off the most affected with more than 90 percent of all cases the most affected province of Hubei, the country seems to have the epidemic - if one can believe the official figures: the number of healed patients is already significantly higher than that of daily new infections. Nationwide, the number of infected in China is currently currently 80,270 people, 2,981 died of the virus. Nationwide, the authorities have announced only 119 on Wednesday, a total of 80,151 people suffered from the pathogen. In Beijing, on the other hand, according to official numbers, 115 people carry the virus in themselves. However, the population must continue to pay the price for this epidemiological success. No other country has made such strict quarantine measures as China. According to estimates, half of the Chinese population lives under restrictions of different severity: millions can not see their families and life partners, may not leave their own four walls over weeks, suffering from loneliness, loss of earnings and unhealthy diet. Especially Millennials, due to long office hours, usually feed from Fastfood supplies, the virus outbreak has been forced to cook experts in recent weeks \nbe. The popular recipes app Xiachufang has been flooded by innumerable new court ideas since February, with the too much time with simultaneous lack of ingredient diversity a separate subgenre: quarantine cooking. It is amazing how basic the everyday life has changed in the Chinese cities: for example, nightclubs stream DJ sets over Tiktok. Fitness studios offer online courses or give your training equipment right to your customers home. But at the same time, the demand for psychological help has also increased. Several universities and governmental organizations have offered online consultations in which the Chinese tell about their fears of coronavirus. \"I left only one mouthguard mask,\" says the owner of a small tree mark in the northwest of London. \"People can not get enough of it right now.\" No panic is still buried in the UK, but people start preparing for a larger health crisis. Meanwhile, 87 cases of coronavirus diseases are known, less than in most of the Western European countries. But the government already warns that it could soon come to an escalation. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson presented a plan to which the spread of the virus should be damaged. The government reserves the right to arrange the closure of schools and restrictions in public transport or forbid larger gatherings. She also launched a public information campaign to help citizens to protect themselves. Particular concern is the great and internationally important London financial sector, which has already affected the spread of the coronavirus. The FTSE, the most important British stock index, lost about 200 billion pounds last week. After the announcement of the British central bank, to grab the economy with all available means under the arms, the financial markets recovered again easily at the beginning of the week. What could be the consequences for other industries showed over the weekend in Northern Ireland: After a first Corona case became known, the authorities told the rugby game between Ireland and Italy. The gastronomy association then complained of losses in the amount of hundreds of thousands of pounds because people remain the pubs where the games are otherwise broadcast live. The British is likely that those skilled in the art are hardly trusting in the ability of the health system to get clarified with a greater outbreak: according to a survey, more than 1,600 doctors are just eight physicians, the NHS is prepared for such crisis. Fixed at the grid of the middle school La Fontaine in Cr\u00e9py-en-Valois hang bouquets in the windy drizzle: past week here a 60-year-old teacher died at the coronavirus. The small town - around 60 \nKilometers northeast of Paris located in the Department of Oise - is one of the centers of the epidemic in France. 47 infections are now counting the authorities. The school was closed like 107 more in the region, but much time to mourn these days does not remain. To connect the virus, the local authorities preached students, their parents and the teaching staff. Experts question each individual, how close to he or she came to the deceased teacher. Ironically, the mayor of the city can not help with the mammary task. \"My test was positive, so I am now the wearer of this mess,\" wrote Bruno Fortier on Facebook. Although he himself has no symptoms, but could infect other people. \"We come to a difficult phase,\" he wrote: \"Let's be solidarically!\" According to official numbers, France currently has 285 infected persons. Four people are so far took the virus. The last case was a 92-year-old man in Brittany, which the authorities announced on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the neighboring country increasingly becomes a lack of incomprehension over the often conflicting security measures. In many places, schools were closed, but Kitas remain open. While the Parisian Book Fair was canceled, football matches could take place in the great stadiums at the weekend. The Eiffel Tower and Disneyland Paris are also open. In the Louvre, the largest museum of Europe, the staff from fear of their own health is in strike. In the overseas part of Martinique, panic islanders seized unusual measures to express their fears: France's television broadcasters show pictures of the weekend, on which an angry crowd attacks a coach with tourists from Germany and Italy, shot the windows and shatters the tires. The virus does not stop before the overseas parties: Guadeloupe has already reported three cases of infected. Very relaxed is the Lord in the citizens, who speaks down in the courtyard of the block of flats with the neighbor. \"So 100,000 infected worldwide - at seven billion people. That's a clack!\", He finds. That's no comparison, for example, with malaria, he continues, and the neighbor nods. So quite Rome these days: There are hardly a few people together, the word Coronavirus falls. Whether on the road, in the bus or at the counter of the espresso bar, there is no escape. But that too is Rome: almost everyone trying to demonstrate serenity. Not the only one of the passengers in the bus towards the city center carries a facial mask, only very occasionally passengers shamed the jacket collar pushed up in front of his mouth or hold a transparent envelope in front of the face. But one is definitely different than ten days ago: The bus is clearly empty. The same applies to the center of Rome. even tourist \nHotspots like the Pantheon seem to have lost their magnetic effect. On the square in front of the ancient Roman temple, on the otherwise always crowd rummages, just lose a few dozen figures. Even in the espressobar Tazza d'Oro right around the corner, in the opinion of connoisseurs the best of the city, you do not have to be at the cash register and then fight for a place at the counter. No tour group pushing in to taste \"The Best Coffee of Rome\". 3,089 Infected there are officially available in Italy, 107 people died of the virus. In the capital, two positive tested patients were reported on Monday, but the virus is already full of dramatic numbers. In the meantime, the Italian government is apparently plans to close all schools and universities in the country because of the Corona epidemic. But even if the tourists stay away, the captains are again greater: a large restaurant with Chinese and Japanese cuisine in a residential area outside the center is almost open to the last place on Saturday night. \"We had a burglary four weeks ago, but now the sales go up again,\" says the owner. Even empty pasta or canned rods are also available in the supermarkets in vain. Rome preserves the socket, with small restrictions. A well-known wants to celebrate her birthday in the restaurant in the city center, she is afraid of the Foreign Award, the front of the Chinese. The foreigners are barely there - they are now afraid of the Italians. No hamster purchases, no excessive mask presence and only a confirmed corona case in the city. Still in New York City everything goes to its regulated gear, but after now 80 demonstrably infected and nine confirmed deaths in the US, some uncertainty is noticeable. This is evident mainly at Wall Street, where the Dow Jones fell by over 4,000 points last week. Even though President Trump tries to push the crash on the stock market on \"market-mindful\" statements of the democratic presidential candidate - the analysts are in agreement: the main responsible for this is the coronavirus. Since the economic consequences are not yet approximately predictable, the markets are increasingly reacting nervous - extreme price fluctuations are the logical consequence. Unlike the markets, the American population of Trump's \"Corona Taskforce\" around Vice President Mike Pence seems to trust. People on airports and subway stations have hardly changed, also facial masks are only found in exceptional cases. In conversations and social media, the virus of many Americans is even smiled rather. Particularly often it is pointed out that a \"stink normal flu\" has a lot of worse effects and would also have survived H1N1 and Ebola. Whether these statements are all meant serious? probably not \nAll and everywhere. Why else would the otherwise popular quarters of Chinatown since the outbreak of the virus with revenue losses of up to 80 percent? The district dominated by the Chinese community named flushing acts as well as extinct in comparison to other neighborhoods, but what also has missing tourists from China. Although so from a panic can not be talked, the Americans are nevertheless careful. Despite all expressions. The Austrian Federal Government is trying to spread peace. For panicmakers, the boulevard, which has been reporting on the \"emergency status\" for days. Federal Chancellor Sebastian short as well as domestic and health ministers inform several times a day: We are prepared for everything, so their message, but currently no drastic measures would have to be taken. The schools remain open, with the exception of the private Vienna International School, in which two trainers have been positively tested. Also large events continue to take place so far. More than 3,000 people have meanwhile been tested, 37 infections confirmed. The first infected, an Italian couple in Innsbruck, are now healthy and allowed to leave the hospital. But over and over again, the tactics seem to come to reassurance to their limits. Although a scarce majority of the population is not troubled, but again and again it comes in various supermarkets to hamster purchases. Longer durable foods are especially in demand. At the border with Bavaria, the entry to Austria was denied on Saturday of a student group from Aachen. A teenager had contact with a coronavirus patient. The bus had to turn around, the student was treated in a hospital in Fussen, the rest of the group spent the night on field beds in a gym. Not quite so rustic ended the journey of an Austrian in Iran: Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg, who flew to Tehran on 22 February, was tested for an infection with the Coronavirus after his return at the Vienna Kaiser-Franz Josef hospital. After all, with him, as in his delegation, the results were negative. Since Monday in Switzerland: Level Red. This means, for example: no shaking hands and stay home with fever and cough. So it recommends the Federal Office of Health. A little distance to other people is important to protect the most vulnerable, Health Minister Alain Berset said late Wednesday night in Bern in front of the media. So far (Stand Thursday morning), 90 Corona cases were confirmed throughout Switzerland. And at night on Thursday, the first Swiss, a 74-year-old woman, died in the Canton of Vaud, in the University Hospital Lausanne at the new lung disease. The virus also has far-reaching consequences for the Swiss economy. The Swiss Stock Exchange recovered on Monday. But in the previous week, the Swiss Market Index had lost so many points \nLike never since the financial crisis, and that after he had achieved a record high beginning of February. Alone the major bank Credit Suisse lost almost a fifth of her value within five days. But not only the financial markets suffer, even the real economy does that. Since then in China, the most important Swiss trading partner after the EU and the US, entire regions have been set in quarantine, Swiss companies are partly massive decline in sales - because they did not get their goods from China still in China. Large corporations like ABB, Schindler, Georg Fischer or Sulzer are just as affected as numerous medium-sized companies. In Switzerland itself, the tourism industry feels the Corona effect. The tourists from China remain out, which is why Lucerne, in the Valais and in the Bernese Oberland already some entrepreneurs already asked for short-time work. Even more serious are the losses in the conference and event business. Since last Friday, all events with more than 1,000 participants are prohibited in Switzerland. Therefore, among other things, the autosalon was canceled in Geneva, the watch and jewelery Fair BaselWorld as well as all great sporting events. And because the event ban is calculated in the crucial phase of the ice hockey and football championship, it is quite possible that the leagues can not be a Swiss master this year. Ghost Games - So Which without an audience - are no option for the officials, too big would be the financial damage. In two and a half weeks, the State Secretariat for Economy will publish its economic forecast, and already today the people say they counted with a \"clear correction\". The unions have therefore asked the Federal Council to act. You float a stimulus program with which the state not only relieve economic corona fever, but should invest massively in climate protection at the same time. Economics Minister Guy Parmelin has once again called a round table with the social partners on this topic. In a way, the Brazilians are used to dealing with epidemics. In 2019, 1.5 million people infected with the dengue fever, more than 700 died. The Influenza A Grip Virus called in 2019 on average two fatalities per day. And the Zika virus, many of the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, should be a term, cost 92 Brazilians last year. There are also diseases like yellow fever (more than 700 dead since 2016), Chikungunya (48 dead 2019) and Sarampo (15 dead 2019). It is therefore understandable that the coronavirus in Brazil has so far no panic triggered. Millions of people, including tourists from all over the world, participated in carnival removals in Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo, Recife and other cities. defiantly ignored the warning of the World Health Organization WHO before larger \nhuman gatherings. lightly dressed, crowded and more intimate interpersonal contacts not averse again this year, pulled the Brazilians two weeks long through the streets. whether there will be a corona-receipt for it, must be awaited. yet are paid by corona-infected but still very low: three confirmed cases there are in Brazil, as well as cases of suspected fraud 531st infected the two are men, they live in S\u00e3o Paulo and have been infected on a italy journey. from the rest of Latin America so far 17 cases reported, seven from Ecuador, five from Mexico and one each from Chile, Argentina and the Dominican Republic. for brazil Ministry of Health is the moment to take no reason, drastic measures. the somewhat frivolous reasoning of the authorities: both infected have been infected abroad, and there is no give indications that the coronavirus continue expanding in Brazil. (The editorial sus is the Brazilian health system, anm.) Contributes - still has brazil government launched an app that the name \"sus coronav\u00edrus\". there you will find hygiene tips and addresses, can suspicion falling to contact you in. some infektologen also advised to be vaccinated as a precaution against the normal flu. they hope that characterized the hospitals in the event of a drastic expansion of the coronavirus would relieved. so slowly they seem so wake up. Rio de Janeiro plans to device a small infirmary for coronavirus-infected - beds with 75th from S\u00e3o Paulo, the most cosmopolitan city of the country, it is reported that the drugstores respiratory masks the inventories and out disinfectant gel. and the always well-attended religious services of the country thinks about it the expiration of the measure: so the people are in our dear father no longer the hands rich.

in small ways, it is already doing so.   each of 54 african nations, for instance, will receive 20,000 test kits, 100,000 masks and 1,000 protective suits for medical use from the jack ma foundation, raised in the name of china's richest man.   chinese medical teams are already on the ground in italy.   but these are, at best, temporary salves that are easily forgotten. what, for instance, are 20,000 test kits and 100,000 masks for a nation the size of nigeria, \nwhich has a population of 200 million?   what's needed is a more sustained effort, and perhaps the route to that would be to build a massive component of public healthcare facilities into china's vaunted belt and road initiative (bri).   since the bri is president xi jinping's signature project, it would, in some ways, have an impact on the way history will view him.   it will also help erase some of the misgivings about bri as a mercantilist enterprise that condemns recipient nations to debt traps even as it oils the wheels of china's wheezing state-owned enterprises.   nations, after all, are but the sum of their individuals. there have been instances in history where powerful men have self-corrected and turned to good work.   remember how former us defence secretary bob mcnamara - who relentlessly threw men, machines and explosives into the vietnam war in the kennedy and johnson administrations - atoned for his actions later by his sincere, committed work as president of the world bank, an institution whose official name is the international bank for reconstruction and development?   on a national level, the us helped japan rebuild after destroying it in world war ii. today, the two have one of the tightest relationships in the world.   japan, for its part, has erased a lot of the bad memories that stem from its aggression in world war ii with its overseas development assistance, not to speak of the investment capital that seeded the east asian economic miracle.   building healthcare as an integral part of the bri is an idea that has been around for a while, but i heard its most impassioned exposition from the mouth of the public health expert priya balasubramaniam, who was a fellow panellist at a seminar held last october in guangzhou, organised by the guangdong university of technology.   dr balasubramaniam argued persuasively that with the rapid pace of globalisation, health problems are no longer issues for a single nation. collective action by multiple countries is necessary to combat global health crises such as infectious diseases, non-communicable disease lifestyle risks, and health inequity beyond state borders.   as we are witnessing, disease threats originating from china - after the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003 and the avian influenza pandemic in 2014, we now have covid-19 - could quickly affect neighbouring countries. china itself has had to confront diseases that spread from elsewhere, such as the 2011 polio outbreak and the zika virus in 2016.   and that is on top of more permanent diseases, including lifestyle-related ones such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. today, non-communicable diseases contribute to 62 per cent of asia's disease burden.   a bri that builds capacity to handle public health emergencies will need to balance preventive and interventionist methods, as well as training of healthcare professionals.   china has the means to do it. one startling revelation during the onset of \nthe wuhan outbreak was the presence in the city of hundreds of foreign medical students. in the subsequent stages, the world witnessed china's impressive ability to respond to a health crisis, including the swift ramping up of the manufacture of medical equipment such as ventilators.   it has also been made aware that china is the world's dominant producer of apis, or active pharmaceutical ingredients, the basic raw material for drugs.   combine that with its leadership in artificial intelligence and its growing strengths in emerging technologies such as blockchain, and you have a powerful force waiting to be unleashed in everything from disease detection to preventing counterfeit medicine.   to its credit, there are indications that beijing is beginning to think in this direction. in a recent conversation with italian premier giuseppe conte, mr xi reportedly spoke of a \"health silk road\".   recent analyses by the beijing-headquartered aiib, which in so many ways complements the bri but with less diplomatic baggage attached, highlighted a direct correlation between overall infrastructure quality and health security, indicating that infrastructure development is a key part of health security and epidemic preparedness.   the bank says it is poised to announce a number of public health infrastructure financing options for its members in the coming days and weeks.   the trick is not just to make health security a function of good infrastructure but to recognise it as a parallel virtue that could even stand on its own.   given asia's demographic trends, the number of asians aged 65 years and above is projected to nearly double - from 412 million currently to 802 million within 20 years.   in absolute numbers, much of the increase will be driven by china, india, indonesia, bangladesh and vietnam. it is clear that healthcare infrastructure will need to be expanded.   the covid-19 crisis only makes the case more urgent.

Since the Chinese city of Wuhan announced the first cases of Coronavirus on December 31, 2019, the figures already exceed 23,000 people infected and 490 dead worldwide, and the number of affected countries round the twenty. On a global scale, the number of deaths follows well below other viruses such as seasonal flu. However, seeing that the transmission of the virus pierced the Chinese borders, the World Health Organization (WHO) ended up declaring a global health emergency last Thursday.\nMeanwhile, scientists try to understand against clock how this virus works, how our cells infects and how it is transmitted between humans. In the last 20 days, more than 50 reports have been published on the Coronavirus, according to Nature magazine. Of these, more than half are in \"pre-print\" repositories, that is, servers that allow sharing scientific articles in open while they are reviewed for publication in academic journals.\nIn an unprecedented agreement, more than 70 organizations (including large publishers such as Nature, Cell or The Lancet and Institutions such as the British Medical Sciences Academy or the US National Institutes) have committed themselves to make public all their work, without waiting for them to be reviewed for their formal publication. Thus, not only are they sharing all the discoveries about the coronavirus with WHO, but are also available for those who want to read them from anywhere in the world.\nBiorxiv is a repository that these days is publishing numerous studies on the nature of Coronavirus (20 during last week), while its Medrxiv counterpart addresses the most health-related aspects (and has published 14 reports on this virus in the same period ).\nIn addition, scientists are putting the genetic sequences of the Coronavirus available to the international community in real time. This collaborative impulse, which was already key years ago with the SARS outbreak or the beginnings of influenza A, is also crucial today to evaluate the situation and guide political actions. To date, the coronavirus is less lethal than the SARS, for example. However, a determined mutation in its genome could dramatically increase its virulence.\nIn emergency situations it is a priority to inform politicians and health rapidly. The publication of an article in academic journals is a demanding process that supposes months or years of work, which delays the arrival of the findings of a research group to the rest of the community. Now, the possibility of sharing them before their formal publication allows reacting to epidemics in a coordinated manner and as developed. \"Quick access to information is essential to contrast everything that is happening worldwide,\" explains Esther L\u00e1zaro, which investigates on virus evolution at the center of Astrobiology. That the publications are free access, in addition, it allows the entire scientific community to evaluate the work, whether or not they are subscribed to the journal. \"These repositories eliminate access barriers in addition to reducing delays, so they are a fantastic way to accelerate scientific advance,\" says Thomas Faust, from the Hindawi scientific publisher.\nThe Achilles heel of the \"Pre-Print\" repositories is their reliability, because the works have not been previously examined by other scientists, unlike those published in journals. From Biorxiv and Medrxiv remember, with a note above each item, which is preliminary reports pending revision. \"These repositories are an extremely valuable resource, but should be used with caution and responsibility,\" Faust warns. \"Readers should be aware that these studies have not been proven with the rigor of usual peer review in academic journals,\" he adds.\nBioxiv itself published a study on the similarity of the coronavirus with the AIDS virus containing serious technical failures. However, several scientists quickly detected these errors and the article is already removed from the server, shows that the \"pre-print\" repositories are subjected to the intense scrutiny of the scientific community. \"The immediate access to what other researchers are doing and being able to comment their articles in a fluid form seems to me the most important advantage [of these repositories],\" Lazaro defends.

On Tuesday, when Wuhan's eleven million metropolis was already a great health crisis, the province's pending party cadre celebrated a gala dinner in wine, dance and vocals. Those politicians prescribing respiratory protective masks and prohibiting public gatherings, greeted the Chinese New Year with a rushing party - the occurrence of coronavirus. Beginas like these gala are lamented as scandalous in social networks. You can feel the rage of young Chinese on the local government. In the press or on television, it is by no means reported, after all, the media in China are under control of the government. But on Weibo or Wechat items especially Millenials short videos from Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus. In it, crowded emergency recordings are visible in which nurses desperate people send home. Or doctors who ask for frustration to be fired. On Saturday, the number of infected quasi had doubled overnight. Meanwhile, according to official information, there are almost 1,400 infectances, over 40 dead and around 240 patients in critical condition. For the Chinese New Year festival, the families all over the country come together to extensive dinner and celebrate together. But now the media of hamster purchases in food and medicines report. In social network, young Chinese make relief that their families have canceled the meetings with relatives at the New Year - for fear of contacting the coronavirus. On the first day in the \"Year of Rat\", Beijing was gently spooky: The streets are empty, temples and palaces for tourists closed, the public celebrations canceled without exception. The few passers-by on the road all carry respiratory masks. According to official statistics, 15 physicians have already infected with the coronavirus in Wuhan, one of them died. The dark figure was much higher, said a doctor of South China Morning Post from Hong Kong. Accordingly, the employees of the hospitals have not been informed at first that the virus is also disseminated via human contact. In addition, they were still missing protective equipment and test kits. In the Chinese state media, such statements were not reported on Saturday. In the evening news on CCTV, from the importance comparable to the Tagesschau, the spokesman with stone expression mentioned only in the fifth post and only briefly the virus. The People's newspaper, the propaganda organ of the Communist Party, also glanced at the health nightstand on its front page. On Saturday night, President Xi Jinping turned to the public. The strong leader of the People's Republic is always considered for social stability and control, but this time his words sounded less than alarming: China is with one \n\"Serious situation\" confronted, cited him the state news agency Xinhua. The novel virus would spread \"with increasing speed\". The recent nationwide measures are radical: Almost all regions of mainland Chinas have proclaimed the highest level of public health, which allows them to enforce quarantine measures at any time. Tour groups from abroad will be banned from Monday, Beijing caps all remote buses. For the first time in China's history, Hubei has made a whole province de facto under quarantine. Her capital Wuhan has since been in the date of emergency: From Sunday, private cars are banned on the streets, the subways do not drive anymore. In social media, users complain empty shelves in the supermarket, which sell only scattered salad heads - for converted five euros per piece. On Twitter, Qinqing Chen, the Chief Reporter of the State Global Times, wrote about the inhabitants of Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province: \"Many of them did not understand that the Coronavirus is a major health crisis - although the first infections already in mid-December have done. \" But just the information policy of the central government in Beijing is with you to blame. On the one hand, it is rightly praised that compared to the SARS epidemic of 2002 transparent operates and more openly cooperates with international health organizations. In addition, there is no doubt that the government takes virus propagation seriously: Within ten days, a hospital with 1,000 beds is currently being built in Wuhan in order to finish with the onslaught of patients. On Saturday, the health commission decided to send 1,200 experts to Wughan in Beijing. 24 General hospitals are converted exclusively to virus control. At the same time, however, it shows that an authoritarian-run system comes without free reporting for transparency issues to its limits. The authorities have warned relatives of infected ones to talk to media or post online about the virus. The censors in Beijing hunt \"sensitive contributions\" in social media. Already in early January, some inhabitants of Wuhans had complained to the Internet spread over the spread of a lungseeing. However, the accused were arrested then - because of the dissemination of rumors.

", "label": 1}, {"content": "explainer: how human body fights infection and how you can boost your immunity. singapore \u2014 while scientists continue to learn more about the covid-19 coronavirus, a question that is often asked is this: why do some people die from an infection but then there are others\u00a0such as singapore\u2019s 76th patient \u2014 a one-year-old baby who recovered in just two days \u2014 who have mild or no symptoms?\u00a0 \u00a0   the answer, experts said, might possibly hinge on a person's immune defences.   researchers are still unclear exactly how this new coronavirus interacts with the human body's immune system, but from reports that have come up, around 80 per cent of the infected cases recover but the rest grapple with severe or critical symptoms.   an estimated 2.3 per cent die from it, based a new study published in the chinese journal of epidemiology that looked at more than 72,000 cases of covid-19 infection\u00a0in china as of feb 11.\u00a0   the\u00a0study by the chinese centre for disease control and prevention showed that for those aged 80 and above, the fatality rate is harrowing \u2014 at 14.8 per cent.   how does the immune system work?   our immune system kicks in when it encounters a threat, such as a virus, bacteria or parasite. yet, it is common to see differing immune responses to the same microbe \u2014\u00a0even among family members.   paediatric immunology specialist liew woei kang is\u00a0the medical director of the paediatric allergy immunology rheumatology centre at mount elizabeth novena hospital. he\u00a0said that there is\u00a0an interplay between a person's\u00a0genes and environmental factors that determine the\u00a0immune system and its response to infection.   this means that lifestyle factors such as how you live, what you eat, how much exercise you get and your medical history could possibly make a difference between life and death in the face of an infection.   the\u00a0immune system is made up of a complex network of\u00a0organs such as the spleen and lymph nodes, immune cells as well as molecules that can be activated to defend against threats to the body.   associate professor liu haiyan said that\u00a0the body\u2019s first line of defence in response to an infection is the barrier function, which includes the skin and mucosal surfaces \u2014 the inner lining of some organs and body cavities such as the nose, mouth, lungs, stomach and intestines.   assoc prof liu is from the department of microbiology and immunology at\u00a0the\u00a0yong loo lin\u00a0school of medicine in the national university of singapore.   like many respiratory infections, covid-19 is believed to be spread mostly through\u00a0droplets emitted from an infected person, such as when the person coughs or sneezes.   someone may become infected if the droplets come into contact with the mucous membranes in the eyes, nose or mouth. transmission may also occur when people touch their eyes, nose or mouth by hands exposed to the virus.   this is also why medical experts have been saying that\u00a0good personal hygiene is important in preventing infections, because\u00a0viruses would have to \nget into the body to cause disease.   the immune system then initiates an early response (called innate immune response), during which immune cells can be activated within a short period of time. however, this early response is usually not enough to deal with an infection, assoc\u00a0prof liu said.   \u201cwe need the activation of our adaptive immune response, which takes about three days (after the early response is initiated).   \u201clymphocytes (one of the types of white blood cells) are the main cell types responding at this stage. some of them can kill viral infected cells and some can make antibodies that help clear the infection.\u201d   what is a healthy immune system and how does it develop?   assoc\u00a0prof\u00a0liu\u00a0said that there are no known medications or vaccine for new pathogens\u00a0such as covid-19 for now, so people would heavily depend on their immune systems to fight the infection.   she\u00a0defines a healthy immune system as one that is\u00a0\u201cbalanced and targeted\u201d and\u00a0can generate a specific response to infections. and it does this without\u00a0inducing much damage to the body\u2019s own tissues and organs.   \u201cpeople who can generate a more efficient anti-viral immune response have milder symptoms when they encounter an infection,\u201d she said.   she explained\u00a0that\u00a0the immune system starts to function from birth but also goes through different stages in a lifetime.   expanding on this, dr liew said: \u201cat birth, babies are partly protected by antibodies from their mothers, transferred via the placenta in the last few weeks of pregnancy. premature babies have lower immunity levels.\"   after birth, the immune system \u201cgets educated\u201d by encounters with various microbes, including infections, probiotics and vaccinations, he said.   the immune system is possibly most primed \u2014\u00a0or ready for \u201cbattle\u201d\u2014\u00a0in childhood and then matures in adulthood, he added.   why do children have 'milder' covid-19 infections?   if a\u00a0young immune system is not fully matured, why do children seem to have less severe forms of covid-19 infection?   associate professor thoon koh cheng of kk women\u2019s and children\u2019s hospital (kkh) said that the effects of the new coronavirus on children seems to share some similarities with the one that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) in 2003.   \u201cin our previous experience with sars, patients who are 12 years of age or younger had milder disease. the younger children were also less likely to be admitted to an intensive care unit or receive supplemental oxygen.\u201d   assoc prof thoon, who is head and senior consultant of infectious disease service at the hospital\u2019s department of paediatrics, said that based on what doctors know so far, if the virus infects a healthy child, he or she should make a good recovery with good medical support.   \u201cmilder symptoms are also observed in children infected with the coronavirus compared to older people.\u201d   dr liew offered several possible hypotheses for this. one of them may be due to children\u2019s many recent encounters with \ninfections including the common human coronavirus, which offer some cross-protection.   for instance, it is common for children to get one to two infections a month in the first six months of starting school \u2014 due to a combination of poor hygiene habits (such as children sneezing and coughing into one another) and viruses circulating within air-conditioned confined spaces, he said.   there are several common human coronaviruses already known that cause symptoms such runny nose, sore throat, headache, fever and cough.   dr liew explained: \u201cwhile a child\u2019s immune system is young, the \u2018soldiers\u2019 are ready. in contrast, an adult\u2019s immune system may have experience with previous infection encounters, but because\u00a0the last illness may have been a while back, the immune system may not be as battle-ready.\u201d   an adult\u2019s immune system may also be senescent (ageing) or dysregulated (not functioning normally), causing an exaggerated immune response.   \u201cthe severe covid-19 cases in intensive care and deaths are often not due to the\u00a0virus, but an exaggerated response to the virus. this results in excessive inflammation in the lungs,\u201d dr liew said.    a computer illustration of viruses coated with white antibodies\u00a0that fight infection. photo: image team/canva   what makes the body\u2019s defences less efficient?   the immune system slowly declines with age and becomes less efficient in dealing with new infections. this is why old people are vulnerable even to common infections.   furthermore, adults usually also have other medical conditions such as ischaemic heart disease or diabetes, which puts them at a higher risk of complications from infections, dr liew said.   assoc prof liu said that as a person ages, there could be a\u00a0reduced number of infection-fighting lymphocytes that respond to the new infection, or pre-existing conditions that dysregulate immune responses. however, it is impossible to specify an age in which the decline happens.\u00a0   other factors such as the person\u2019s lifestyle habits, nutrition and mental health status matter, too.   dr melvin look, a consultant gastrointestinal and laparoscopic surgeon at\u00a0panasia surgery, pointed out that old\u00a0people tend to also have micronutrient malnutrition, which can affect their ability to fend off infections. \u00a0   at a media talk on gut health and immunity on tuesday (feb 18), dr look said that research has found links between the immune system and the gut, which contains 70 per cent of the cells of an immune system.   \u201cthe immune system requires a healthy gut to provide nourishment,\u201d he said.   \u201cwith ageing, the gut is less able to absorb micronutrients from food consumed. because of the lack of these essential micronutrients, the immune system becomes less efficient.\u201d   there is also evidence to show that mental health has a big impact on physical health, dr look added.   psychological stress of any duration, from several days to the chronic types that lasts for years, can cause immunity to go downhill.   in some \ncases, the immune system may also go awry, and over-react to perceived threats when it should not.   assoc\u00a0prof liu said: \u201cif our immune system is over-reactive to some environmental agents that are not harmful to us, such as dust mite and pollen, we can have allergies.   \"autoimmune diseases are caused by an activated immune system targeting our own tissues, resulting in inflammation and damage.\u201d   how do we\u00a0improve the immune system?   while some factors\u00a0such as\u00a0genetics or age\u00a0cannot be changed, the medical experts said that making certain lifestyle changes might be able to improve a person\u2019s response to illness. \u00a0   \u201cpeople who have a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise, balanced nutrition and less stress tend to have a more efficient immune system fighting infections,\u201d assoc\u00a0prof liu said.   support your immune system with the following tips:   1. cut out junk food   dr look said that processed food\u00a0\u2014 refined carbohydrates, sugar, processed meats, fat \u2014\u00a0disrupts both the gut and immune system.   \u201cthe first thing you should do at a time when you might be prone to infections is to stop taking so much sugar. this is\u00a0because\u00a0bacteria, viruses thrive on sugar. the more sugar you keep, the easier it is for them to gain a foothold on your defences,\u201d he said. \u00a0   2. ensure a well-balanced diet with nutritious foods   dr liew, who sees more infections in fussy eaters with a low vegetable and fruit intake in his practice, emphasised the importance of a balanced diet with adequate water intake. he said that vitamin c supplementation has the strongest evidence in reducing recurrent infections.   dr look advised increasing the intake of plant-based whole foods that\u00a0are packed with micronutrients\u00a0such as zinc, iron, copper, folic acid and vitamins a, b6, c and\u00a0e. these\u00a0are required for the body to fight infections.   the general rule of thumb for healthy eating is to \u201cfollow the rainbow\u201d, he said. eating a wide range of vibrantly coloured fruit and vegetables provide a variety of nutrients needed\u00a0for good health. these may include vegetables such as tomatoes, berries, pumpkin, oranges, spinach, eggplant and broccoli.   3. consider intermittent fasting   dr look said\u00a0it has been proven that intermittent fasting, a form of time-restricted fasting, promotes autophagy. this is a process whereby the white blood cells clean out the unhealthy, damaged cells in the body.   there is no hard and fast rule as to how often one should fast, but dr look said that beginners can try a 16-hour fasting, followed by consuming food during an eight-hour window, several times a week.   all other rules of healthy eating and maintaining adequate\u00a0nutrition\u00a0still apply when it is time to eat.   4. get regular doses of sunshine or vitamin d   a person who is\u00a0deficient in vitamin d is likely to be more susceptible to\u00a0infections.   vitamin d, which is produced by the body when exposed to sunlight and in small quantities in food such as salmon, egg yolk, fortified orange juice and \ncereal, could boost the immune system, dr look said.   exposure to sunshine also elevates mood and improves sleep at night, which are also important in maintaining a good immune system.   the world health organization states that getting five to 15 minutes of sunlight on the arms, hands and face twice or thrice a week is sufficient.   5. exercise regularly, but do not overdo it   one of the basic tenets of healthy living, regular exercise has been linked to fewer colds and infections.   a study published in the american journal of lifestyle medicine in 2011 found that moderate exercise of walking improved immune response and reduced incidence of upper respiratory\u00a0illness.   people who engaged in regular moderate exercise \u2014 such as five days a week of walking 45 minutes each\u00a0session over 15 weeks \u2014\u00a0reduced their number of sick days by up to half, compared to sedentary people.   however, too much intense exercise, such as more than 90 minutes of high-intensity endurance training, has been linked to reduced immunity.   6. manage stress   numerous studies have shown the relationship between physical and mental health. stressed out, isolated people tend to have poorer immune functions, the american psychological association said, and recommended stress-relieving tips such as:   adopting good lifestyle, sleep and dietary habits   cultivating\u00a0strong social support to improve resilience   relaxing muscles through stretching, massages or warm baths   meditating\u00a0for five minutes a day or similar calming activities   taking\u00a0a moment to notice nature   reframing\u00a0thinking to manage emotions   seeking professional help   7. take\u00a0protective measures\u00a0   even if your immune system is in tip-top condition, taking steps to avoid infection is still important in preventing infections. this is because viruses would have to get into the body to cause disease, assoc\u00a0prof liu said.   assoc\u00a0prof thoon of kkh said that while there are very few cases of covid-19 infection reported among children, people of any age are susceptible to infection.   here, again, are the necessary protective measures against this new coronavirus:   avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness   observe good personal hygiene   wash\u00a0hands\u00a0with soap and do not touch the eyes, nose or mouth after touching\u00a0surfaces that are commonly used   cover the mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing\u00a0and dispose of the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately   seek medical attention promptly\u00a0if feeling unwell and wear a mask   children who are too young to comply with strict hand hygiene should be guided\u00a0by parents and caregivers   avoid crowded places ", "label": 1}, {"content": "philippines wants to postpone asean para games amid virus scare. kuala lumpur (bernama) \u2013 the philippines may postpone the 10th

to 40,000 people the world over has arguably become one of the worst international health crises of this century. the covid-19 infection (earlier known as 2019-novel coronavirus or 2019-ncov) started in early december last year in china's wuhan city. according to the latest update from the world health organisation, people in at least 25 countries have been infected by covid-19 so far.\nwhile the increasing spread of coronavirus outbreak has put all sections of society at risk, the risks associated with covid-19 infection for pregnant women need special attention.\nin a recent study published in the lancet, an internationally renowned health journal, researchers said available evidence so far indicates that the risk of vertical transmission (mother-to-child) of covid-19 infection might be low or equal to that seen during the sars-cov-1 outbreak years ago.\nthe study, published on february 12, was based on an analysis of nine pregnant women who were infected with covid-19 and delivered babies.\nthe researchers wrote, \"as the covid-19 outbreak unfolds, prevention and control of covid-19 infection among pregnant women and the potential risk of vertical transmission have become a major concern.\"\nanalysis of the nine pregnant women infected with covid-19 and their newborns showed that only two newborns contracted covid-19 infection after birth.\nthe first case was confirmed 17 days after birth. the child had a history of having close contact with two people who were infected with covid-19-the mother and maternity matron.\nin the second case, the covid-19 infection was confirmed at 36 hours after birth. in this case as well, researchers said possibility of a close contact with an infected adult after birth could not be ruled out.\nthus, in the limited study of nine infected pregnant mothers who delivered babies, there weren't any cases of newborns with covid-19 infections at birth. this indicates that transmission of the infection from mother-to-child did not take place during the pregnancies.\nthe researchers have however cautioned that this is a limited study and though its findings are valuable in the present context, more evidence needs to be gathered.\n\"although the study analysed only a small number of cases (nine women with confirmed covid-19 pneumonia), under such emergent circumstances these findings are valuable for preventive and clinical practice in china and elsewhere,\" the study said.\nbesides this, all the nine deliveries in this study were caesarean. thus, the study cannot comment on whether vertical transmission of covid-19 is possible during vaginal birth.\nthe other limitation that the study faces is that it focuses on women in late stages of pregnancies. more evidence is needed to comment anything on the risk of mother-to-child transmission or other risk factors associated with women who contract covid-19 in early stages of pregnancy.\nthe study found that symptoms of covid-19 infection among pregnant women are similar to those noticed among other adults.\nhowever, no reliable evidence is as yet available to support the possibility of vertical transmission of covid-19 infection from the mother to the baby.\nthe lancet study said pregnant women are susceptible to respiratory pathogens and to development of severe pneumonia, which possibly makes them more susceptible to covid-19 infection than the general population.\nthis is especially if they have chronic diseases or maternal complications.\nhere are the general precautions that who has advised to prevent covid-19 infection: ", "label":

covid-19 outbreak, all eyes are on the budget this year, specifically the \u201cstrong\u201d relief package that the government had promised.   analysts are expecting the relief package to be at least s$500 million, more than double what the government doled out back in 2003, when singapore was going through an outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars).   deputy prime minister heng swee keat will deliver his budget speech on tuesday (feb 18).   mr heng, who is also finance minister, said in a message to singaporeans on sunday that he will unveil a set of \u201cbroad-based\u201d measures to support viable companies and help workers stay in their jobs, with more given to sectors that have been harder hit, such as food and beverage (f&b) as well as retail.   \u201cwe will also support firms and workers to make the best use of this period to restructure, train, and upgrade so that we emerge stronger when the eventual upturn comes,\u201d said mr heng.   there will also be a package for households to help with their cost of living.   mr heng's assurance came days after national development minister lawrence wong said in an interview with bloomberg that singapore will roll out a \"strong\" economic package to mitigate the fallout from the covid-19 outbreak.   with singapore still reeling from the effects of a trade and tech war between the united states and china, in addition to being battered by the virus, mr liang eng hwa, the chairperson for the government parliamentary committee (gpc) for finance, as well as trade and industry, said that budget 2020 is \u201cthe most important budget to have in recent times\u201d.   \u201cwe are in extraordinary times. we need an extraordinary budget to deal with both short-term and long-term challenges,\u201d he told today.   the covid-19 disease originated in the chinese city of wuhan and has spread to 29 countries and territories, including singapore.   the city-state has confirmed 75 cases of the covid-19 virus, the highest number outside of china.   prime minister lee hsien loong said on friday that the economic impact from the covid-19 virus is already greater than sars and he does not rule out a possible recession to hit the city-state.   while the covid-19 virus is deemed less deadly than sars and more similar to the h1n1 swine flu outbreak in 2009, dbs economist irvin seah said: \u201cbut because of the weak economic fundamentals at present, the travel ban being imposed, as well as the heavy reliance on china, the impact of covid-19 will be deeper than sars\u201d.   as the first h1n1 case was confirmed only in may 2009, months after the budget was delivered, budget 2009 was focused on countering the impact of the global financial crisis then.   \u201cby the second quarter of 2009, the economy had recovered strongly from the financial crisis. hence, there was no need for a relief \npackage for the h1n1 outbreak,\u201d said mr seah.   a s$500 million package, at least   in view of the challenges that the singapore economy is undergoing, analysts say that the relief package this time should be bigger than sars, since the city-state\u2019s economy is now a lot more dependent on china than in 2003.   besides chinese travellers forming a bigger portion of singapore\u2019s tourist arrivals, many singapore companies have production facilities in china.   china\u2019s contribution to singapore\u2019s economy, as well as the southeast asian region, has more than doubled compared with 2003, analysts say.   mr seah told today that the size of the covid-19 relief package this time would likely be more than double the s$230 million sars relief package, while ms selina ling, ocbc bank\u2019s head of treasury research and strategy, said it would be at least s$500 million.   in a research note published on feb 7, mr seah said: \u201cwe expect the upcoming epidemic relief package to pack more punch and certainly more comprehensive than the previous one. this will form a significant portion of the overall budget plan.\u201d   the s$500 million estimate, some analysts say, is conservative.   it is assuming that the government would be carving out roughly the same percentage out of its gross domestic product (gdp) for the relief package, just like it did in 2003.   the s$230 million sars relief package accounted for about 0.13 per cent of singapore\u2019s s$170 billion economy back then.   the s$500 million estimate is about 0.1 per cent of singapore\u2019s economy in 2018, which stands at about s$491 billion.   however, cimb economist song seng wun said that a relief package worth more than 0.1 per cent of singapore\u2019s gdp could be a possibility, given that businesses today are far more entrenched with china.   \u201csomething closer to 1 per cent of gdp may be needed,\u201d said mr song.   that would amount to about s$5 billion.   any difference from the sars relief package?   with the tourism and transport sectors the worst hit during this crisis, just like how it was during sars, analysts expect the package this time to also target these same sectors and offer similar kind of reliefs.   this means that businesses in these sectors could be provided with property tax rebates and have their licence fees waived, while small- and medium-sized companies could be offered a bridging loan to tide through cash flow problems.   to tie in with singapore\u2019s long-term goals of getting companies to digitise and transform, analysts expect the retraining of workers to still take centre stage in this year\u2019s budget, much like in previous ones.   mr liang, who is also member of parliament for holland-bukit timah group representation constituency (grc), said that direct assistance is needed to incentivise companies to hold on to their staff.   some examples of direct assistance he cited are wage subsidies, support for enterprise financing and training support.   \u201cit\u2019s a way to incentivise employers to keep employees and \nsend them for training rather than ask them to take no-pay leave,\u201d he said.   tax rebates and offset packages do not provide immediate relief, which is what companies are in need of now.   \u201call in, it\u2019s a grim picture. it\u2019s really bad because of how the virus came suddenly,\u201d said mr liang.   while the sars relief package was targeted at the tourism and transport sector, some analysts say some differences this time would be that help could be provided to a greater number of sectors.   the gaming sector, for one, may be receiving some support, said ms ling, as the two integrated resorts did not exist back in 2003.   mr seah said the relief package may also lend a hand to the wholesale trade, financial services and construction sector, due to their heavier reliance on china\u2019s economy.   in 2003, wholesale trade and financial services were two sectors that did not suffer during the sars outbreak, he noted.   how about those who are self-employed?   another difference would be how assistance is calibrated to support full-time workers and self-employed staff differently.   the manpower ministry told the straits times that workers who are on leave of absence but can continue working through telecommuting arrangements should not apply for the daily s$100 allowance.   \u201cthere is that kind of segregation, so it\u2019s such that not everybody can have a free ride,\u201d said ms ling.   the difference can already be seen in the s$77 million support package for transport workers, where most taxi drivers would automatically receive s$20 in their hiring account every day, while only private hire drivers who have completed at least 200 trips a month from october to december last year are eligible for this relief.   the rest can tap a s$2.7 million fund set up by the government and the labour movement national trades union congress (ntuc).   transport economist walter theseira, who is an associate professor at singapore university of social sciences, said that policymakers back in 2003 did not have to deal with designing relief for such self-employed workers.   \u201chow do you differentiate who is doing it for a living and should qualify as taxi drivers, and who isn\u2019t\u2026 the problem when it comes to providing relief is how do you take care of the drivers? should it be pro-rated? it\u2019s not clear what is the correct solution,\u201d asked assoc prof theseira.   while platform operators such as grab and gojek would have the data on how much time their drivers are spending on the roads, they do not have visibility on what these drivers are doing for the rest of the time.   for example, a driver may be driving four hours a day for grab, but also spending another four hours driving for gojek. but the platform operators would only know how much that driver is driving on their own platform and may not classify him as someone who drives for a living.   possible to dip into the reserves?   most analysts and also mr liang agree that it is not necessary for the government to dip into the past \nreserves to finance the virus relief package.   based on the ministry of finance budgeting for the financial year of 2019 and 2020, it is estimated that the current term of government would have a surplus of about s$15 billion by the end of this financial year.   \u201cthe last time when they used the reserves, that was during the global financial crisis. we were in an outright recession. this time, there are downside risks but no recession yet. they have s$15 billion plus to spend first,\u201d said ms ling.   however, mr song from cimb said that it is a possibility for the government to tap the reserves, depending on the size of the package they are providing.   \u201cthe government always said that the reserves are for rainy days. it\u2019s about as rainy as it gets for many businesses right now,\u201d said mr song.   support for health workers   as singapore grapples with the escalating covid-19 outbreak, much attention has been on the healthcare workers, who are on the frontlines caring for patients infected with this virus.   dr chia shi-lu, chairperson for the gpc for health, said that he hopes there will be some financial support for the nurses and doctors who have had to work longer hours, and may be getting a smaller bonus this year as public hospitals have had to shelve revenue-generating cases to deal with this outbreak.   \u201cat least, so that their work is not shortchanged\u2026 they are not worse off,\u201d he told today.   while healthcare workers are expected to cast aside whatever prior-made plans in times of an emergency, he hopes at least that their basic salary will not be affected.   \u201cespecially those in the lower earning categories, like nurses, i hope they also get bonuses and so on, depending on how the hospital does,\u201d said dr chia, who is also mp for tanjong pagar grc.   it was announced on thursday that healthcare workers working in public institutions will get help defraying the cost of their cancelled travel plans, if they cannot get a refund from their travel agent or insurance companies.   but dr chia hopes that healthcare workers who have had to cancel holiday plans will also be able to get some form of compensation.   \u201cnow a lot of travel companies are hurting, unlikely they can refund. but for healthcare workers, they don\u2019t have a choice, they have to do it,\u201d he said.

bleak. nearly 500,000 people have been infected, and more than 21,000 had died as of thursday (march 26).   the international system has reverted to every country for itself, as borders have gone up and globalisation has come down. the world as we knew it is unlikely to be the same, but regions as they were remain relevant.   the association of southeast asian nations (asean), as the region\u2019s grouping, must face up to the crisis together or risk being torn apart by it.   having gone through the thick and thin of international affairs for more than 52 years, asean's resilience is self-evident.   its first two decades were beset by ideological divisions between indochina and the rest, but since then asean has managed to make itself the centre of a broader asian regionalism, playing an architectural role to promote regional peace and stability by setting up a host of cooperative vehicles and mechanisms \u2014\u00a0 from the asia-pacific economic cooperation in 1989 to the east asia summit and asean defence ministers' meeting plus more recently.   but asean has never faced anything like covid-19. this is a fast-spreading public health crisis in a region with weak healthcare systems. case numbers in southeast asia so far appear suspect with a lot of downside risks.   thailand's infections have surged past 1,000, while malaysia's is approaching 1,800. a country of 270 million, indonesia has reported fewer than 800 infections thus far.   the philippines, with its population of 110 million, also have reported well below 1,000, and only a handful of cases were reported in cambodia, laos and myanmar.   mortality rates have remained under international benchmarks of 3-4 per cent, based on established numbers of infections.   what is troubling for asean is that these numbers likely stem from under-reporting, and will probably rise alarmingly in the weeks ahead.   to asean, as a region of 660 million with an aspiring economic community, the coronavirus is an existential danger. based on known facts, figures and trends, it is not far-fetched to estimate that many millions of people across asean will come down with the disease.   too many could perish in the process, as healthcare systems in less developed asean countries, such as cambodia, laos and myanmar, become overwhelmed.   for thailand, these three mainland southeast asian countries are particularly crucial, because the thai economy relies on their migrant labourers.   asean has banked itself on its development potential and its geostrategic location straddling northeast asia, south asia, and the asia-pacific, and europe.   it is the fastest-growing region in the world, with a growth trajectory of more than 5 per cent.   its internal market comprises relatively young demographics and rising middle classes with increasing purchasing power.   although \ndomestic politics are contentious in almost all asean countries, the region is devoid of cross-border conflict.   what asean aspires to be can come to naught if the covid-19 pandemic is not contained. the disease is making its rounds in waves through countries, with potential reruns.   the public health crisis is just the beginning, as its impact will spill over into the socio-economic realm \u2014\u00a0from social re-adjustments due to increased mental and physical isolation to economic recessions and possibly an outright depression, depending on how wide and deep the pandemic runs and how governments responses around the world respond to it.   compared to the devastating 1997-98 economic crisis in southeast asia, covid-19 may actually be much worse.   back in the late 1990s, southeast asian economies, especially thailand and indonesia, could find a lender of last resort in the international monetary fund and turn to external demand for economic recovery.   this time, the global market will not be ready and demand won't be enough to prop up asean's growth and recovery.   at the minimum, what asean needs is transparency and coordination. asean member states must come clean about their number of cases and roll out wider testing.   some asean countries, such as malaysia, the philippines and thailand, have imposed virtual lockdowns to slow the coronavirus' spread, but this should be considered for the entire region for a limited period. if not, asean's pronouncements on health sector cooperation as part of the asean vision 2025 will be rendered moot.   singapore has led the way by biting the bullet early on and imposing travel restrictions and social distancing measures. in fact, its vigilant handling of the covid-19 outbreak is being used as an example for other countries.   thailand and malaysia, behind the curve until recently, are following suit. vietnam, as asean chair, also has tried to stay on top of the outbreak, having come up with and exported affordable covid-19 test kits.   once asean's more medically-equipped members manage to contain their outbreaks, they should start helping their other asean neighbours, as the disparity and inequality between asean's members are well-known.   covid can do a lot of damage across southeast asia, but unless asean responds as a region, the pneumonia-like disease will keep circulating among its 10 members for much longer.   while asean has to treat covid-19 as a regional challenge, the 10-member grouping also has to avoid being further divided by the geopolitics of the coronavirus.   china appears to have seen the worst of the outbreak and is now extending assistance to other afflicted countries. to

time is of the essence when it comes to curbing the spread of the coronavirus (2019-ncov) that has infected more than 30,000 people worldwide in the span of a month.   identifying those who may be infected with the virus is especially critical.   yet, since those infected exhibit pneumonia-like symptoms such as fever and cough - symptoms that could have been caused by other viruses or bacteria - it may not be possible to identify all of them by sight or clinical examinations and routine laboratory tests.   a diagnostic test that can quickly and accurately detect the presence of the virus in a patient is crucial, so that he or she can be quarantined and treated before the disease spreads.   yet, because so the virus is so new, there has not been a widely implemented test for its detection.   nations and companies, including those in singapore, are now working to develop such a diagnostic test kit.   one of them is home-grown biotech company acumen research laboratories.   its director and chief scientist, dr\u00a0ong siew hwa, said current testing procedures require initial screening and verification steps, in a process that could take up to a day for every one patient sample.   \"the latest policy protocol is that all patients exhibiting pneumonia-like symptoms will be tested for the novel coronavirus. this could cause a bottleneck in diagnosis of the patients using the current method,\" said dr ong.   the prototype of a diagnostic test developed by her company has two advantages over the current method, she said.   first, it can analyse at least 24 patient samples at a time. two, it reduces the time required for sample analysis from about a day\u00a0to just about two hours.   said dr ong: \"if this prototype is scaled up and produced on a mass scale, it will allow doctors to quickly sieve through all suspected cases, as well as those exhibiting symptoms of pneumonia, from patients who have the virus.\"   in the conventional testing method, samples such as of lung fluids are first taken from the patient and sent to the clinical testing lab.   next, lab technologists process the sample using a method known in molecular biology as the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to determine if the sample contains any detectable genetic material of the coronavirus. this could take up to four hours.   if the results test positive for the coronavirus, the sample will be sent for genome sequencing, to confirm the findings. the initial screening and confirmation by genome sequencing can take up to 24 hours, said dr ong.   but the prototype can shorten this process to just about two hours, she said.   key to its development was the availability of the genome of the virus, which is unique to it, and can serve as a \"fingerprint\" that helps scientists distinguish it from other viruses.   the genome of the 2019-ncov was made publicly available last month by scientists \nin china, where the first patients were identified. this allowed scientists to determine that the new virus was closely related to the virus that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) in 2003.   dr ong told the straits times: \"but even though the genome of 2019-ncov is about 80 per cent similar to the sars virus, there were many parts in the genome where they differed.\"   these differences could function as \"red flags\" for doctors, if a diagnostic test could highlight them.   in essence, that is what such diagnostic test kits, including the one from acumen research laboratories, can do. such test kits often differ in the part of the genome they highlight as \"red flags\".   similar to conventional methods, doctors collect samples from a patient's lungs or cough mucus (such samples are known as sputum), and process the sample via pcr.   through the use of the kit and by programming the pcr machine to recognise these \"red flags\", subsequent analyses would be able to determine if they could be detected.   this reduces the need for additional genetic sequencing, although this could be done if additional verification was required, said dr ong. she added that the next step was to try out the test using actual samples of the pathogen collected from patients.   separately, dr ong's firm last september received a $600,000 grant from the chinese government to develop a kit that would allow doctors to identify patients who have infections, such as pneumonia, and are at a greater risk of developing sepsis.   sepsis refers to a life-threatening condition caused by the body's response to an infection.   the body normally releases antibodies and chemicals into the bloodstream to fight an infection, but sepsis occurs when the infection-fighting chemicals turn against the host, damaging multiple organ systems.   these sepsis kits are now ready, and can be deployed to china when hospitals there call for it, said dr ong. she added that the kits will be sent to hospitals there at cost, as part of the firm's national service to fight the outbreak of the disease.

At the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities of the World Health Organization WHO reported an accumulation of pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause in the Central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the diseases. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days then a group released a group of the virologen Christian's premier from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 the first diagnostic test for the new virus, the researcher provisionally call 2019-NCOV. With the test, the virus can be detected in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, on which, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as well as Mers (MIDDLE East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses which have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more than 750 died. With the MERS virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronaviruses. Many of them relate to respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example.\nIn China, several thousand persons are suffering from them, some of them - most of them with pre-existing conditions - have died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first infection cases outside of China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been in Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection with a tourist, who came back from Wuhan, on January 24, the first cases were known in France. Meanwhile, first cases were confirmed in Germany. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. The virus can cause pneumonia that can endally end. Since it is a viral illness, antibiotics do not help.\nMeanwhile, it is clear that the virus can be transferred from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transfers after a dozen cases were known in medical staff. Medizors assume that the virus is transmitted above all over droplet infection. The World Health Organization calculates, as announced on January 24, at the moment that an infected one cuts 1.4 to 2.5 other people. Contest these numbers, the virus is less contagious than SARS and also the viral flu. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThat can not be said yet. The World Health Organization said on 28 January that about one-fifth of the reported cases through the virus will be seriously ill, so in case of doubt must be treated intensive care. According to reports, the first death pots were patients who had some severe pre-existing conditions. Even with other infectious diseases, people with pre-existing diseases are particularly endangered - for example at the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so change their genome. This can cause you to become more dangerous for people in the course of an outbreak - but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) expects no similar mortality to the current time as the outbreak of SARS.

foreign worker levies to cushion the impact of\u00a0the covid-19 outbreak because\u00a0it wants to focus on preserving\u00a0jobs for singaporeans and to encourage\u00a0restructuring, manpower minister josephine teo told parliament on wednesday (feb 26).   ms teo spoke after two labour members of parliament (mps) made speeches calling for foreign worker levy cuts, similar to those implemented during\u00a0the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) outbreak.   the mps are mr seah kian peng of\u00a0marine parade group representation constituency (grc)\u00a0and nominated mp arasu duraisamy, who is a member of the national trades union congress\u2019 central committee.   nominated mp douglas foo, president of the singapore manufacturing federation, said that business operators are\u00a0hoping\u00a0for the government to \u201cextend a further helping hand\u201d by suspending or waiving levy collection for existing work permit holders during this uncertain period.   ms teo, however, said that the government\u2019s priority\u00a0in supporting businesses is\u00a0to \u201cpreserve local employment\u201d, adding that a levy waiver or a cut \u201cwill not benefit the many employers who only have local employees\u201d.   waiving or cutting levies will\u00a0also \u201cblunt the motivation\u201d among businesses to restructure, improve job quality and become leaner in manpower, she pointed out. \u201cwe would not have seen how industries can rise to the occasion.\u201d   ms teo cited the example of the hotel industry that\u00a0has shown resolve and creativity in overcoming their manpower constraints.   for instance, housekeepers at copthorne king hotel on havelock road no longer waste time knocking on doors to figure out which room should be cleaned and are now notified through a mobile application, which\u00a0is linked to an in-room control unit that also turns off electrical power when guests have left.   and andaz hotel in the beach road area no longer has a team of confectioners in its kitchen and instead keeps its customers happy with supplies from tiong bahru bakery and cleverly brands this as part of the heritage experience for guests, she pointed out.   \u201cas much as we want to help businesses, measures to deal with the short-term fallout should not negate longer-term efforts for companies to become less reliant on foreign manpower for growth,\u201d ms teo said.   \u201clevy waivers or reductions would\u00a0run counter to both objectives.\u201d   the tourism, food-and-beverage and retail\u00a0sectors, for example, have been hit hard\u00a0by the covid-19 outbreak.   ms teo reminded the house of the budget this year where\u00a060 per cent of the s$4 billion stabilisation and support package\u00a0would go to the jobs support scheme and enhanced wage credit scheme, which would benefit firms with singaporean\u00a0staff members.   on the upside, she noted that the government has not raised levies this time round. they had stayed the same since 2017 for the construction \nsector, and since 2016 or earlier for other sectors.   the levy rates for workers in the marine shipyard and process sectors were supposed to go up\u00a0by between s$50 and s$150 in 2018 and 2019, but those increases\u00a0were deferred.   the levy rate for the basic tier of s-pass holders is at s$330, while the levy rate for other s-pass holders is s$650. levy rates for work permit holders are between s$250 and s$950.   while there is no change to these levy rates, ms teo said that the government had acted to waive levies for employers whose foreign workers are required to serve quarantine, leave of absence or stay-home notices after they have recently travelled to china.   alternatives to no-pay leave and layoffs   ms teo said that companies with excess employees should consider other options instead of getting their workers to go on no-pay leave or laying them off.   she highlighted that the tripartite advisory on managing excess manpower and responsible retrenchment recommends redeploying the workers to other work areas, giving them shorter work weeks, implementing job-sharing, or introducing adjustments to certain wage components.   \u201cthese options would at least maintain most, if not all, of the workers\u2019 past incomes,\u201d she said.   for employers with excess foreign workers, the singapore business federation will administer a temporary scheme to help transfer the workers to employers with manpower shortages, she said.   this will help employers whose workers from china\u00a0have not obtained approval to return to singapore and employers who cannot hire new\u00a0workers ho are chinese\u00a0nationals due to suspended approvals.   ms teo said that\u00a0companies are already proactively considering such sensible measures that do not just cut costs but save jobs and she is heartened by their efforts.   some are asking their workers to clear their annual leave or time off, and others are exploring shorter work weeks while getting\u00a0their workers to for for training to for upskill themselves.   the disease outbreak has\u00a0sparked a \u201cviral interest\u201d among workers in using technology for alternative work arrangements, she said.   even mature workers who were struggling to pick up digital tools had found ways to work virtually \u201calmost

For the first time since the outbreak of the coronavirus, a person outside China has died of the consequences of novel respiratory disease. As the World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Sunday, a Chinese from Wuhan died in the Philippines, where the Coronavirus has emerged in people for the first time in December. Since then, it has since spread to almost 30 countries. \"This is the first reported death outside of China,\" said WHO representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe in Manila. He added, however, one must take into account that the man did not infect himself in the Philippines. The dead is a 44-year-old man who first came into the hospital on 25 January with fever, cough and sore throat, said the Philippine Ministry of Health. Later, the man was suffering from pneumonia. He had found himself in a stable state and show signs of recovery, it continued. Surprisingly, his condition had deteriorated again in the last 24 hours and he had died in a hospital in Manila. At the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities of the World Health Organization WHO reported an accumulation of pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause in the Central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the diseases. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days then a group released a group of the virologen Christian's premier from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 the first diagnostic test for the new virus, the researcher provisionally call 2019-NCOV. With the test, the virus can be detected in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, on which, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected. Both the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as well as Mers (MIDDLE East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses which have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more than 750 died. With the MERS virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronaviruses. Many of them relate to respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example. In China, several thousand persons are suffering from them, some of them - most of them with pre-existing conditions - have died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first infection cases outside of China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been in Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection \nA tourist, who came back from Wuhan, on January 24, the first cases were known in France. Meanwhile, first cases were confirmed in Germany. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. The virus can cause pneumonia that can endally end. Since it is a viral illness, antibiotics do not help. Meanwhile, it is clear that the virus can be transferred from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transfers after a dozen cases were known in medical staff. Medizors assume that the virus is transmitted above all over droplet infection. The World Health Organization calculates, as announced on January 24, at the moment that an infected one cuts 1.4 to 2.5 other people. Contest these numbers, the virus is less contagious than SARS and also the viral flu. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals. That can not be said yet. The World Health Organization said on 28 January that about one-fifth of the reported cases through the virus will be seriously ill, so in case of doubt must be treated intensive care. According to reports, the first death pots were patients who had some severe pre-existing conditions. Even with other infectious diseases, people with pre-existing diseases are particularly endangered - for example at the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so change their genome. This can cause you to become more dangerous for people in the course of an outbreak - but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) expects no similar mortality to the current time as the outbreak of SARS. As the Philippine Health Minister Francisco Duque announced, the man had traveled to the country on the side of a Chinese woman, which had also been positively tested on the virus. The woman is currently getting in the hospital of the infection. Shortly before the death, the Philippine Government had closed the national border for all foreign travelers from China. Other countries, including Australia and the US, have imposed similar entry bans. In the People's Republic, the number of infected and death victims is increasing despite massive safety precautions. According to authorities, 304 patients have previously died in the virus in China. More than 14,300 people infected in the country. Nine cases are known in Germany. Spain also reported that a German tourist on the coronavirus was ill. A passenger aboard a Bundeswehrmaschine, with which more than 100 Germans returned from the Chinese city of Wuhan on Saturday, is suspected that \nVirus in itself. The Central Chinese million metropolis Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, is considered the center of spread and is under quarantine. Currently, it is assuming that wild animals virus was transferred to people on a market. Because of the rapid distribution of the virus, a city outside the province of Hubei has now massively restricted the freedom of movement of its inhabitants. In the nine-million-inhabitant Metropolis Wenzhou on the East Coast of China, only one person per household may only be on the road every two days to shop for life, shared the local authorities. The city also closed 46 motorway sites. The Chinese government also called on the weekend to postpone weddings and to hold funeral celebrations in a small framework.

highest chances of dying from infection of all age groups, according to the largest study since the highly contagious outbreak began in china, with details of nearly 44,000 cases. the study, published on monday in the chinese journal of epidemiology, revealed that a total of 1,023 deaths have occurred among 44,672 confirmed cases as of february 11, for an overall case fatality rate of 2.3 per cent. the novel chinese coronavirus, or covid-19, has so far killed over 1,800 individuals and infected more than 72,000 people, chinese health officials said on tuesday. according to the clinicians from the chinese center for disease control and prevention, majority of the patients were aged 30-69 years (77.8 per cent), male (51.4 per cent), farmers or labourers (22 per cent), and diagnosed in hubei province (74.7 per cent). the study noted that people with ages 80 and above had the highest case fatality rate of all age groups at about 15 per cent. it said the death rate from the disease for males was 2.8 per cent and that for females was about 1.7 per cent. in terms of occupation, patients who reported being retirees had the highest case fatality rate at about 5 per cent, and those in hubei province had a fatality rate that was more than seven-fold higher at nearly 3 per cent compared to patients in other regions of china, the study noted. the researchers reported that patients with comorbid conditions had much higher fatality rates -- 10.5 per cent for those with cardiovascular disease, 7.3 per cent for diabetes, and 6.3 per cent for chronic respiratory disease, 6.0 per cent for hypertension, and 5.6 per cent for cancer. the fatality rate was about 50 per cent for cases categorised as critical, the study noted. assessing the cases as they emerged over the weeks, the scientists found that in december 2019 only 0-22 cases/day began to experience symptoms with the peak onset of symptoms for all cases overall occurring on february 1, 2020. since then, the researchers reported that the onset of illness has declined. the researchers noted that the virus is highly contagious. \"it has spread extremely rapidly from a single city to the entire country within only about 30 days,\" the researchers reported in the study. \"moreover, it has achieved such far-reaching effects even in the face of extreme response measures including the complete shutdown and isolation of whole cities, cancellation of chinese new year celebrations, prohibition of attendance at school and work, massive mobilisation of health and public health personnel as well as military medical units, and rapid construction of entire hospitals,\" they said. overall, the scientists said the viral infection has been mild for nearly four-fifths of the patients and has a very low case fatality rate. among the 1,023 deaths, they noted that a \nmajority have been of age 60 years or older and/or have had pre-existing, comorbid conditions like hypertension, heart disease, and diabetes. \"moreover, the case fatality rate is unsurprisingly highest among critical cases at 49 per cent, and no deaths have occurred among those with mild or even severe symptoms,\" the clinicians wrote in the study. the scientists also suspect that the virus may have jumped from animals at huanan seafood wholesale market in wuhan to humans at several times in the past. this, they believe, may have allowed the novel coronavirus to be transmitted from a still-unknown animal into humans and, due to its high mutation and recombination rates, they speculate it adapted to become increasingly efficient at human-to-human transmission. the study also noted that some strategies used to curtail the spread of the outbreak may have worked. \"the downward trend in the overall epidemic curve suggests that perhaps isolation of whole cities, broadcast of critical information (e.g., promoting handwashing, mask-wearing, and care-seeking) with high frequency through multiple channels, and mobilisation of a multi-sector rapid response teams is helping to curb the epidemic,\" the researchers wrote in the study. one limitation pointed out by the authors of the study is that a large proportion of the 72,314 cases reported in the study were not confirmed by the sensitive nucleic acid testing as this process is slow, labour intensive, and requires specialised equipment. however, all the cases were diagnosed clinically and investigated by trained epidemiologists, they said. according to the authors, while the actions taken by the chinese government has slowed down the epidemic in china, and curbed its spread to the rest of the world, there may be more challenges ahead. \"huge numbers of people will soon be returning to work and school after the extended new year holiday. we need to prepare for a possible rebound of the covid-19 epidemic in the coming weeks and months,\" the researchers warned. ", "label": 1}, {"content": "WHO monitors the progress of the new virus that from China has already crossed two borders. Scientists begin to call him the Wuhan virus, in reference to the Chinese city where he was born. There, in a market, it is suspected that the microorganism jumped for the first time of an animal to a person. Since it was discovered, the last day of 2019, has caused at least 41 infections, two lives has been charged (the second Thursday), and has already crossed two borders: first that of Thailand and, on Thursday, has come to Japan in the agency of a 30-year-old man who had been in the Chinese town, but not in his market. This begins to draw as possible a scenario that the researchers considered unlikely: that the virus is able to be transmitted between humans. The World Health Organization (WHO) works with expert and researchers networks to coordinate surveillance, epidemiology, diagnosis, clinical care, treatments and transmission pathways of this virus, from the SARS family. This, also originated in China, caused the death of more than 700 people in 2002. It was deadly in approximately 10% of the cases, although it varied a lot between population groups: among the youngest there were almost no death, while among those over 65 they reached 50% of the infected. Although in principle, \"does not seem as worrisome as SARS,\" in the words of Virologist Volker Thiel, scientists work in unraveling the complete sequence of the new microorganism to know all their characteristics and prepare an answer. The international medical community knows that at any time a new virus or its mutation can cause a serious pandemic in the world, which call \"X disease\". It does not seem to be the case: WHO has cataloged the risk of expansion as high within the country, moderate in the region and under globally. \"But we must be prepared in case the outbreak expands,\" says Thiel, researcher at the University of Bern. The first case that came out of China was recorded last Monday in Thailand: a 61-year-old woman staying stable and who assures that she was not in the market either. Dozens of people in Singapore, South Korea and Hong Kong who have fallen ill after visiting Wuhan are or have been under surveillance, although for now none has given positive for the new Coronavirus and his ailments were due to other pathogens. In the case of Japan, the patient spent four days hospitalized and was discharged on Wednesday. WHO has indicated that \"it is not surprising\" that there are cases were China and that \"there may be more in the future\", so it has called all countries to improve coordination and extreme prevention measures. According to Carrie Lam, head of the Hong Kong Executive, a team of territory experts visited Wuhan to obtain first-hand information about the outbreak, \"at the invitation of the National Health Commission\". Your latest data encrypt the total number of positives \nTo date at 41, five of them serious condition and 12 already high, with 119 people who are being carried out medical follow-up. The first mortal victim was a 61-year-old man who died on Saturday as a result of complications derived from infection. The second death is a 69-year-old man who presented serious inflammation of myocardium, renal failure and damage to different organs. Those affected have shown symptoms similar to those of pneumonia, with fever and difficulty breathing. Local authorities in Wuhan ensure that there have been no new positives in Patrio soil since January 3. The task is now double. On the one hand, on the ground, closure the market where the outbreak occurred, it is intended to cut new transmissions. It is also necessary to track other potential spotlights, which would be a possible cause for contagious that did not step on this scenario. On the other hand, in the laboratories, after sequence the virus, it is necessary to study its chain of 30,000 nucleotides to compare them with existing viruses and know their differences and similarities. It is known that it is a coronavirus of the family of SARS and MERS-VOC (respiratory syndrome of the Middle East) that since 2012 has caused 858 deaths, but not a mutation of these. Of the latter, ported by camels, there is a trickle of cases since then, always transmitted from these animals to humans. The epidemics are much more complicated to stop if they can get involved among people, something that is still not clear in this case. This, says Isabel alone, a researcher at the CSIC National Biotechnology Center, depends on mutations that suffer viruses, which are initially in animal reservoirs, very often of bats. \"The Coronavirus have a RNA sequence, which gives them a great genetic variability, and changes by mutations and recombinations that give them new properties. If a change appears that gives you ability to infect an intermediate animal, that virus will jump. And the same goes between these and humans. But it is not enough that it is mutated, there must be contact, an opportunity to give that leap, \"she explains alone. Recent doubts with respect to virus transmission mechanisms have fueled social concern. Even more taking into account the proximity of the Chinese New Year, celebration that will take place on January 25. On the occasion of this national festival is tradition that people return to family home - although many others choose to travel outside the country-, as involved in the world's greatest human migration with more than 3,000 million displacements. In 2002, the Chinese government already opted to reduce a week's vacation to only one day, to restrict movements and reduce the possibilities of spreading SARS. Experts point out that the authorities of the region have learned the lesson, so the developed protocols have already begun to \napply. While in 2002 the reaction of the Chinese government was to hide the epidemic, on this occasion they have reacted quickly, starting a research team and applying insulation measures from the first moment. Preparations for the Exodus of next week have already begun. Chinese hospitals accumulate protective material and many have raised insulation cameras. Countries like Thailand - which during this festival is usually 800,000 Chinese tourists, Indonesia, Australia, Malaysia or Singapore, all of them usual destinations, have launched their own security measures. These include the establishment of controls at all airports that have connections to Chinese cities and the installation of scanners terms to monitor the temperature of travelers.

There are at least 571 people infected only in Chinese continental territory and cases were already detected in Macao, Thailand, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan and the United States. Chinese authorities consider that the country is at the \"most critical\" point in terms of prevention and control of the virus and placed quarantined, preventing entries and exits, three cities where more than 18 million people live - Wuhan, the neighbors Huanggang And Ezhou. In an unprecedented effort to try to lock the propagation they also canceled the Chinese New Year celebrations in various locations including the capital, Beijing. The first cases of the virus \"2019 - NCOV\" appeared in mid-December in the Chinese city of Wuhan, capital and largest city in the Chinese province of Hubei, when they began to reach people with a viral pneumonia. The symptoms of these coronavirus are more intense than a flu and include fever, pain, general malaise and respiratory difficulties, including lack of air. The World Health Organization Emergency Committee (WHO) returns today in Geneva in Switzerland to decide whether it declares an international public health emergency the outbreak of the new coronavirus. ", "label": 1}, {"content": "The Bulles of the Coronavirus, a dangerous sprout of confusion and distrust. A similar situation was experienced during the Ebola epidemic of 2014. A global health crisis appears, with great uncertainty about how it will evolve, which causes concern in society. A perfect growing broth to appear Bulles, misinformation and distrust towards the health authorities. Six years ago, mistakes were made in government communication by Spain that were corrected by facing Fernando Sim\u00f3n, director of the Health Alerts and Emergencies Coordination Center, which is now responsible for reporting the evolution of Coronavirus. However, then, the scenario of propagation of lies and half truths was not as complex as the current one. A good example is what happened on Thursday and this Friday with statements by the prestigious Medical Pedro dugs to the public mirror program, antenna 3. Cavadas is a surgeon, not expert in virus or epidemics, but said, in reference to Chinese authorities: \"If they recognize a number of deaths and contagious, huh, it is not necessary to be very ready to think that there is about ten or a hundred times more.\" The alarming message of this video spread massively by social networks, such as WhatsApp and Facebook, and later many media collected these statements and spread them among its readers. Apart from the doctor's intentions, they would undoubtedly be good, it does not seem like the indicated voice to inform about this outbreak. \"In this case, several things come together, because dugs has a great prestige and authority in their field and among the public, but at times like this you have to be very cautious with what is said, especially if you are not a specialist and do not count With direct information, \"he warns Carolina Moreno, a professor at the University of Valencia and expert in scientific and health disorder. \"It's an opinion, but people do not take it as one more opinion because he is a very respected doctor, and does not help reinforce confidence in the authorities, so necessary in these cases,\" she adds. Not any misinformation is malevolent or deliberate. The Coordinator of the #Saludsinbulos initiative, Carlos Mateos, believes that in situations like the current one, with 19 Spaniards returning from the area affected by the virus, speculation should not be disseminated. \"And if it is necessary to speculate, that they are people or institutions with knowledge on the subject, which is a reference in that field. If someone has to doubt China's opacity, which is the perfect seed for disinformation, who are experts, workers On the ground or WHO itself, \"he says. Mateos has identified numerous Bulos that are circulating by all types of channels from the hatching of the crisis in the media. Above all, those related to difficult images to locate, but of great impact. \"You have to have precaution, distrusting someone who appears with mask, for example, that can be any site or \nany year. However, they propagate very easily and very fast, \"regrets Mateos, Vice President of the Association of Researchers in ESALUD. Above all have circulated Bulles and misfortunate with an origin outside of Spain, encouraging all kinds of conspiracies about the cause, the reasons and The \"Hidden Truth\" on the outbreak. But with the repatriation of the Spaniards from Wuhan, many more Spanish invoice will appear, according to Mateos, giving closeness to the hospital or the returned. For example, on the fact-checking platform damn It has denied a tuller that ran through mobiles that ensures that the \"Ministry of Health\" (in Spain is Ministry of Health) has made public a \"emergency notification\" in which it informs that \"the crownbreak of coronavirus this time It is very serious and deadly. \"Everything false. In his last appearance, Fernando Sim\u00f3n has pointed out that\" the epidemic has the chance to start remitting soon. \"In addition to the press wheels that has been giving Simon, the Minist Health ERIO has agreed with Twitter for the platform to refer to your official account when users consult about this matter. To avoid confusion, specialists ask to attend only authorized voices or official accounts of agencies involved. Otherwise, noise can generate confusion and distrust towards the management of the epidemic. Two days ago, the country ensured in its publisher that \"you have to maintain an attentive surveillance, but without falling into alarmisms that can aggravate the consubstantial damage to an epidemic of this nature.\" In the same way, The New York Times warned in its editorial that distrust in science and institutions can be a serious problem if the outbreak gets worse: \"Another important problem is the lack of public confidence: control measures only work if People comply with them. And it is much less likely that people follow orders when they do not trust the authorities. \" and remembered again the case of Ebola: \"Trust can be as important as technology and financial resources to keep coronavirus outbreak at bay, as world health workers learned during recent Ebola outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \".

At the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities of the World Health Organization WHO reported an accumulation of pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause in the Central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the diseases. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days then a group released a group of the virologen Christian's premier from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 the first diagnostic test for the new virus, the researcher provisionally call 2019-NCOV. With the test, the virus can be detected in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, on which, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected. Both the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as well as Mers (MIDDLE East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses which have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more than 750 died. With the MERS virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronaviruses. Many of them relate to respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example. In China, several thousand persons are suffering from them, some of them - most of them with pre-existing conditions - have died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first infection cases outside of China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been in Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection with a tourist, who came back from Wuhan, on the 24th. \nJanuary the first cases were known in France. Meanwhile, first cases were confirmed in Germany. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. The virus can cause pneumonia that can endally end. Since it is a viral illness, antibiotics do not help. Meanwhile, it is clear that the virus can be transferred from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transfers after a dozen cases were known in medical staff. Medizors assume that the virus is transmitted above all over droplet infection. The World Health Organization calculates, as announced on January 24, at the moment that an infected one cuts 1.4 to 2.5 other people. Contest these numbers, the virus is less contagious than SARS and also the viral flu. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals. That can not be said yet. The World Health Organization said on 28 January that about one-fifth of the reported cases through the virus will be seriously ill, so in case of doubt must be treated intensive care. According to reports, the first death pots were patients who had some severe pre-existing conditions. Even with other infectious diseases, people with pre-existing diseases are particularly endangered - for example at the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so change their genome. This can cause you to become more dangerous for people in the course of an outbreak - but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) expects no similar mortality to the current time as the outbreak of SARS. The Coronavirus named 2019-NCOV opened for the first time in December on a market in the eleven million inhabitants of Wuhan. Much of the infected patients in China lives there. Meanwhile, there are infections in France and the USA, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam and also in Australia. Diseased suffering from coughing, fever, breathing difficulties, to a pneumonia. The president of the Robert Koch Institute, Lothar Wieler, despite these numbers no major health hazards in Germany. \"The danger to the German population is very low,\" said Wieler in ZDF and also appreciated the risk of a worldwide spread of the virus beyond single cases as \"currently low\". This also displays on the pure mortality rate. This is compared to the number of infected \"not very high\". Wieler also sees Germany \"absolutely well prepared\". At airports where the virus could be introduced, one was \"very well prepared\" thanks to steady exercises, the RKI president. \nIf the virus should be introduced, it is important to recognize this morning. Generally, there are still many open questions, for example, as dangerous the pathogen is indeed. Especially in China, the virus had spread rapidly in recent days. As the authorities announced, the total number of registered united illnesses is now around 2,750; At least 81 patients died of the consequences of the infection. The Chinese authorities are trying to stop the spread of the virus by means of drastic travel restrictions, while the World Health Organization (WHO) has not yet speak of a \"health care of international scope\". Among other things, the UN organization's experts refer to the small number of cases abroad. Currently, WHO General Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus is in Beijing to personally inform about the latest findings to the virus.

hopes they will abide by 15-day lockdown. it\u2019s now impossible to ignore the ever-growing threat of the covid-19 pandemic, especially after singapore has shut its doors to countries that are hardest-hit by the virus and sent out a call for citizens to minimise travelling where possible.   over in europe, which is arguably the current epicentre of the covid-19 outbreak, france has become the third eu country after italy and spain to be on lockdown in a bid to contain the rapid spread of the virus.   former mediacorp host sharon au, who moved to paris in 2018, has become one of the many singaporeans who have been affected by the lockdown, although the 44-year-old sounded as cheery and collected as ever when she spoke to 8days.sg over the phone from her home in the french city.    \u201cit\u2019s been like\u2026 over an hour since the lockdown came into effect?\u201d she quips as we ask her how she\u2019s dealing with being cooped up at home. \u201cthey only announced it last night, so it hasn\u2019t quite sunk in yet.\u201d   this isn\u2019t her first brush with having to deal with a crisis, as she recounted how she was in japan in 2011, when the tohoku earthquake and tsunami, and the subsequent fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster occurred. perhaps that\u2019s why she has taken everything in her stride, or perhaps, she chuckles, she\u2019s adapted to the french c'est la vie (or 'taking life as it comes') mindset.    having said that, sharon is still very much singaporean and admitted that she couldn't help but feel a tiny bit compelled to return to singapore, especially after her friends and family texted her to come home following french president emmanuel macron's lockdown announcement.   she mused: \u201clife still goes on. even if i wanted to come home, i can\u2019t because of the lockdown. for now, it\u2019s in effect for 15 days, but realistically speaking, it could last for way longer than that if you look at how quickly the number of patients is increasing. honestly, i might be safer staying in my apartment than being at the airports right now. i\u2019m aware that a lot of cases now are imported as people making their way home or away from the hotspots, so i think less traveling is better for now.\u201d   8 days: what's going through your mind now?sharon au: there\u2019s actually a sense of normalcy because everyone outside is so calm. (laughs) it\u2019s definitely not as exciting as my friends thought [it would be]. i went out for a walk before the lockdown came into effect. i went to the bakery and had a stroll along the seine river since i knew it might be a while before i could do that again.   are you not allowed to go out at all?if you have to go out for emergency purposes such as seeing a doctor, going to the pharmacy, or you need to buy food, you need to download an approval form from the government website. after filling in the details, you need to print it out and carry it with you when you go out. it\u2019s a bit extreme and if you\u2019re found without the \nform, or without your identity card, they can fine you. oh, one of the possible reasons for you to leave the house is to walk your dog. (chuckles)   that doesn\u2019t seem too bad.it\u2019s alright for us because we have access to news all the time, but i expect it to be very hard for tourists. the singapore embassy has been posting a lot of information and asking us to spread it on social media. tourists might not be privy to announcements, so they might not know that they need to fulfill those requirements in order to step out of wherever they are staying at. that being said, the french are very flexible so even if they do catch the tourists, they might just fine them the minimum of 38 euros and explain the current situation to them.   are there still a lot of tourists around?even before the lockdown, i went to the champs-\u00e9lys\u00e9es and it was completely empty! it was like a ghost town. i anticipated that stricter measures would come soon, because the situation felt very grave and people are taking travel advisories very seriously.   you went to the bakery, but not the supermarket, before the lockdown was announced. why?even before the announcement, i\u2019ve been going to the supermarket regularly to buy food and ingredients to cook at home. we dine out less often these days because of the current health issues. but that day, i wanted to get my favourite pain au chocolat to munch on as i strolled down the river, and i also got two traditional desserts to eat after dinner.   have there been instances of grocery hoarding?the panic shopping hasn\u2019t really manifested. of course, there were queues in front of the supermarket and bakery, but it\u2019s not extraordinarily terrible. people don\u2019t hoard products. i see people coming out with bags full of stuff, but they just buy what they need for a week.   that's great. i think it also helps that people feel assured. for example, two days ago, i went to buy eggs and the entire shelf was empty. but when i went the next day, it was refilled and there\u2019s no shortage whatsoever.   so you\u2019re set for the next 15 days, right?(laughs) i\u2019m going to overeat for sure. i just keep opening stuff to eat when i'm at home and it's worse because it's all snacking! i can imagine myself reaching out for nutella while i\u2019m doing my work, so that\u2019s not very healthy either. my pilates classes are obviously cancelled so i\u2019m going to turn the carpet into my yoga mat for now.   is it still possible to get food delivered to you?definitely. my friend pearl owns the one and only singapore food restaurant in paris. it\u2019s called the hood and she\u2019s converting her kitchen to one that is fully delivery-based right now. restaurateurs need to survive because people can\u2019t go to them any more, so they have to do deliveries. there\u2019s an italian restaurant just below where i live that i go to very often. the owner saw me and gave me his number, telling me to call him anytime i or anyone in the building needs food and he will get it delivered to us. i think it\u2019s very \nimportant to help each other out wherever we can, especially in times like these.   have there been queues for masks?even when i went down for a walk just now after the president\u2019s very serious declaration, nobody wore masks. i was one of the three people who was wearing one. it\u2019s quite strange and i\u2019m not sure why.   is it because they\u2019re sold out everywhere?(pauses) ah. i'm looking it up on the internet right now. masks are by prescription, so you have to go to a doctor or pharmacist to get a prescription to get masks. even then, people are just not used to wearing masks. they might use their scarves to cover their faces so you can only see their eyes, and that\u2019s about it. if you see people wearing masks, it\u2019s probably me or other tourists. (laughs)   how much does it cost to get masks right now?hmm, let me check. wow. the ffp2 mask, which is really high end, is \u20ac9.90 (s$15.50) each. wow. (pauses) there are the regular surgical masks too, which are \u20ac4.90 (s$7.70) for 50 masks. i\u2019m checking the prices online now, but you can\u2019t just order it on the internet. currently, they\u2019re reserved only for hospitals and healthcare workers.   does that mean that people can\u2019t get masks now?even if they were available, the people here still wouldn't wear masks. that\u2019s why i think the lockdown is really necessary in this instance. the french don\u2019t really take advice or instructions very well. when we were told not to gather in big groups, you walk past the bars and restaurants and they\u2019d be packed and you'd see people partying. (laughs)\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b french people in general are very chill. during the lockdown announcement, the president sounded very exasperated that people didn\u2019t heed the advice and instructions and he mentioned that it\u2019s really frustrating for the government. they're very unlike singaporeans. once our government says something, we will do it.   but they\u2019ll stay indoors now that the lockdown is in place, right?wow. actually, i have no idea! it\u2019s been less than two hours, and since i\u2019m at home, i don\u2019t really know what it\u2019s like outside. i hope they do listen, though. the president kept saying that we\u2019re at war and it\u2019s really surreal to hear such announcements. i hope that the people who have been underestimating and mocking the virus will sit up and realise that it\u2019s all our responsibility to be non-spreaders.   non-spreaders?yes! there have been so many instances where people were complacent because they didn\u2019t display any symptoms, so they think that they aren\u2019t carriers, but ended up spreading it to others. it's terrible.   asians all over the world have told stories of being treated unfairly since the outbreak began. have you personally encountered any incidents?i\u2019ve heard a lot of unpleasant experiences from my friends. fortunately, i haven\u2019t personally encountered such treatment, even when i traveled to london for work and to babysit my godchildren. there were a lot of negative displays towards chinese people there, but i was very lucky. that \nbeing said, i\u2019m sure encounters like that exist. people don\u2019t just lie about bad experiences like that. even in paris, some of my friends had pretty bad experiences.   such as?i won\u2019t go into specifics, but i\u2019m guessing that might be because of where they live and hang out. i live in the office area and it\u2019s very cosmopolitan here. my residential area is mostly made up of elderly folk and they\u2019re just very sweet.   there have also been viral videos on social media of italians singing from their balconies. has anyone in the neighbourhood done that yet?(chuckles) i\u2019ve watched those videos and i\u2019m just so encouraged by them. it shows how passionate the italians are. in paris, it\u2019ll probably differ according to which district you\u2019re living in. i used to stay in the 4th district. i can imagine that people will party and sing in the balcony because it\u2019s a very flamboyant and joyous district. here, however, the age range is a lot more skewed towards the older folk and i\u2019m not sure if they will appreciate noise. (laughs) i\u2019m not sure how they\u2019ll react if i start singing from my balcony.   you could always go with a classic that they would love.people might join in if i pick the french national anthem. or you might just end up seeing a video of me singing to the eiffel tower with everybody trying their best to ignore me. (laughs)   are you really going to do that?i seriously might, because it\u2019s going to get so boring after day three of the lockdown. i\u2019ll send you the video if i really do it.   once the lockdown is over, will you have enough masks to wear?i brought a packet of 10 when i came back from singapore, and my friends gave me some when they came to visit. i\u2019d say i have like 20 right now. i guess that\u2019s okay since we won\u2019t be going out anytime soon.   did you wear one all the time before the lockdown?(hesitates) i came back in the middle of february and because i was back home, we were trained and conditioned to wear masks. but when i landed in france, i immediately took off my masks because people would look strangely at me if i was wearing one. then, it was still viewed as an asian virus and i didn\u2019t have the courage to wear it because i felt uneasy about the way people might look at me. i was also worried that they might even beat me up. on hindsight, i think i was pretty cowardly.as i carried on with my day-to-day life, i didn\u2019t wear a mask on the subway or on the bus. i had an internal struggle between feeling uncomfortable having people stare at me if i wore a mask versus just walking to where i wanted to go, and i ended up just walking, because i wouldn\u2019t be in an enclosed space with so many people if i were outside.   that must not have been easy.yes, but now it seems like the tables have turned! when i was on my walk just now, people were looking at me as though they wanted to take my mask away from me. personally, i feel that we should\u2019ve gotten prepared long ago. the outbreak started in china late last year, and while china was having \nto deal with the widespread effect of the virus, people on this side of the world were were just looking at them thinking that it would never happen to them. some of the western press were mocking how wuhan went into lockdown 'cos they felt that it was too drastic, but now they have to resort to the same measures.   we're glad to hear that you're doing okay.(pauses) i can only say that everything feels normal because i'm healthy. i can\u2019t imagine having to face uncertainties of whether i\u2019m able to have access to healthcare when i need it. it\u2019s also a very timely reminder that we should respect regulations and rules and not take things lightly. i hope the people here now have that drilled into their minds.c'est la vie \u2014 that\u2019s their culture. the french are very chill and laugh things off very easily. i think it\u2019s cool, but not when there\u2019s a health war going on. the gravity of this issue needs to be addressed as how the asian countries have done so. i\u2019m really so proud of singapore and taiwan for coping with it as well as they have. even in south korea, it was like a bomb went off there two weeks back, but when you look at it now, the mortality rate is so low and their numbers are under control.   in europe, it\u2019s almost as though healthcare can\u2019t cope because their mortality rate is through the roof. it\u2019s time for everyone to face reality.    photos: sharon au's instagram ", "label": 1}, {"content": "Italy returnees in Germany with coronavirus infected. After the outbreak of a coronavirus epidemic in Italy, the novel virus has been demonstrated in Germany with an Italy vacationer. It deals with a 25-year-old who probably infected during an Italy trip in Milan, the Ministry of Health in Stuttgart said. For the first time in North Rhine-Westphalia, a person is demonstrably ill at the novel virus. The infection was diagnosed with a man from Heinsberg, as NRW Ministry of Health and Kreis announced. The person concerned was recorded on Monday afternoon with symptoms of severe pneumonia in an Erkelenzer hospital. \"The patient is in a critical condition and is currently isolated on the intensive care unit.\" According to DPA information, it is in the middle of 40 and suffers from a pre-disease. The patient's wife will also be treated stationary with symptoms of a viral disease. Your condition is currently stable. The diagnosis, whether you have also infected with the virus, stand out. The diseased man had had contact with a friend, according to the local Landrats Stephan Pusch, which had been held in China for business lately. That reported the \"Aachen Zeitung\". Whether this man had to go in treatment, Pusch could not say first. First, the \"Rheinische Post\" had reported on the first case in NRW. The Heinsberg district called a crisis rod. The health department is currently investigating all sorts of contact persons. The crisis staff had already taken first measures - schools and kindergartens in the district area should remain closed on Wednesday as a precaution. The district administration Heinsberg will not open for the public traffic. \"We had to assume at the latest since the first cases in Bavaria, that even in North Rhine-Westphalia with an import of infection cases and other transmissions and infection chains is expected,\" said NRW Health Minister Karl-Josef Laumann. The authorities went to the cases with high pressure to prevent further dissemination of the coronavirus as possible. Healthcare is \"well prepared for such diseases and prepared\". The Universityikum D\u00fcsseldorf shared, expecting the two patients from Erkelenz over the night with a transport of the D\u00fcsseldorf fire department. They would be isolated and treated according to the specifications of the Robert Koch Institute. In Germany, there are now more than a dozen proven infections with the novel coronavirus. So far, the cases stood in a direct connection with the outbreak in China. Experts assume that there are very probably undiscovered infections in Germany. The 25-year-old from the district of G\u00f6ppingen was ill for his return from Italy with flu-like symptoms and have contact with the \nRecorded local health department, it was said from the Ministry of Health in Stuttgart. He should be brought into a clinic on Tuesday evening and be housed and treated insulated there. Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg's Health Minister Manne Lucha (Greens) breaks his vacation and wants to inform the case together with experts on Wednesday. He warned at Tuesday evening for prudence: \"Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg has set itself early on this case. All involved jobs work closely and intensively, \"said the minister. It will now be determined who had contact with the patient. Meanwhile, more and more European countries report evidence of the pathogen. Austria, Croatia, the Spanish mainland and Switzerland reported on Tuesday of Covid-19 cases. In Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg there is the first confirmed case. On the Spanish holiday island Tenerife, after a confirmed disease, a large hotel with around 1000 tourists - including Germans - was placed practically under quarantine. In the Golf Region, the virus threatens to spread. Cross-border rice barriers are not an adequate answer in view of the Coronavirus outbreak in Italy, in view of the Coronavirus outbreak. The German Health Minister Jens Spahn said in Rome after a crisis meeting. \"We jointly believe that at this time, now, travel restrictions or even the closing of borders would not be adequate, proportionate measure,\" explained the CDU politician. Health Ministers from Italy, Germany, Austria, Slovenia, France, Croatia and Switzerland had discussed the situation together in Rome. Many of the new evidence in European countries are related to the most recently severely affected Italy. In Tenerife, a visitor from Lombardy was positively tested for the virus, as the Spanish Ministry of Health announced. The region is the most strongest area affected by the virus in northern Italy. In the evening, it became known that the wife of the tourist was also positive. Both patients are isolated in a hospital on the Canary Island. The hotel, where the couple had vacation for almost a week, has been quarantined since Tuesday morning. According to a report by the TV station Antena 3, guests were asked to stay in their rooms until further notice. Doctors should investigate people. Even on the Spanish mainland, the pathogen has now been demonstrably arrived. In Barcelona, \u200b\u200ba woman was positively tested for the Spanish Ministry of Health. She should recently returned from a trip to northern Italy, the newspaper reported \"La Vanguardia\". The novel coronavirus has also reached Austria. A 24-year-old woman and her equal friend had been positively tested on the virus, reported a spokesman for the clinic in Innsbruck. both \nStammed from the room Bergamo in Italy. Meanwhile, both are in good condition and already fever free, so the director of the university clinic for internal medicine, G\u00fcnter Weiss. The search for possible contact persons is in progress. In the course of this, a hotel in Innsbruck was blocked in which the sick woman worked. To what extent guests were affected, was initially unclear. In Croatia, the first infection was demonstrated by a man who had previously been a few days in Italy. The first proof in Switzerland occurred according to the Federal Office of Health in the Canton Ticino. In Italy, the spread of the pathogen is proven in more and more regions. Meanwhile, 322 people were infected, of which eleven had died, said civil protection chef Angelo Borrelli. How it could come to such a rapid outbreak is not yet known. In Lombardy, ten communities in the province of Lodi were explained to blocking zones. There control security forces who may be in and out. The risk of infection with the virus is currently \"low to moderate\" after a new ECDC assessment for Europeans. The spread of the virus meets the German economy in the middle of the lull. Because economic growth stagnated in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the previous quarter, Europe's largest economy goes without any significant tailwind to the current year. The German economy sees development in Italy - the third largest euro economy - with concern. \"Germany's strongest trump card has become a weak spot: the openness and dependence on exports and global trade,\" explained Carsten Brzeski, Chief Volkswirt of the ING Germany. In South Korea, the number of new evidence continues to increase: within 24 hours of 144 cases to now 977. The number of deaths rose to ten. The US government wants to provide $ 2.5 billion for the fight against the novel coronavirus. The virus is \"very under control\" in the US, but the government wants to act as a precautionary, US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday in New Delhi in front of journalists. According to US media reports, around a billion dollars of funds are to be put into the development of a vaccine. The congress must only be approved. In Iran, the number of reported deaths from 12 rose from 12 to 15, as the spokesman of the Ministry of Health in State television explained. According to him, there were now 95 people - 34 more than the day before, from different parts of the country have been positively tested on the virus. Iran's regional neighboring countries Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain and United Arab Emirates (UAE) reported several new cases of patients who had previously traveled to Iran. Some countries in Arabian tried to prevent propagation by reduced travel connections with Iran. Also in China the situation remains tense. Like the Beijing Health Commission \nannounced, another 71 people came to life. The total number of deaths in China rose to 2663, the number of proven infections climbed by 508 to 77 658.

important lesson for other governments in fighting the disease\u00a0\u2014 be prepared to pay so that patients won't let costs deter them from getting tests and treatment.   the coronavirus\u00a0\u2014 which causes a disease called covid-19\u00a0\u2014 has spread to more than 100 countries, with italy, iran and south korea emerging as growing epicentres of the epidemic.   italy has reported more than 10,000 cases of infection, overtaking south korea as the worst affected country outside china. the united states has also begun to report more confirmed cases as health authorities cleared some restrictions that had limited the availability of testing for the contagion.   but in china, where the disease was first reported, the epidemic is waning, with 24 new cases of infection reported on wednesday (march 11).   a coronavirus test reportedly costs about 370 yuan (s$74) in china. and in the southern city of shenzhen, the average cost of treating the disease ranged from 23,000 yuan for elderly patients to about 5,600 yuan for minors, the chinese hospital management journal reported on feb 28.   some of the country's treatment methods such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation \u2014 which artificially oxygenates a patient's blood for a limited period of time\u00a0\u2014 are expensive but they are all covered by the government, which has earmarked 110.48 billion yuan for treatment, subsidies for medical staff and medical equipment.   in the us, where there have been 25 deaths among 696 confirmed cases, public anxiety is growing over the cost of testing.   the us government does not charge for coronavirus confirmation tests at designated laboratories but a trip to the hospital will incur other hefty expenses, in one case over us$3,200 (s$4,448). insurance lobby group america's health insurance plans said individuals needed to check their insurance providers for coverage of costs related to covid-19.   as of monday, only 1,707 people had been tested by the us centres for disease control and prevention. more tests may have been conducted at lower level public health laboratories but the number of infections could also be bigger, according to a new cedars-sinai study, which estimated that between 1,043 and 9,484 people in the us may have been infected by march 1.   south korea, with more than 7,700 covid-19 patients as of wednesday, announced in january that the government and insurance companies would cover the expenses associated with examination, isolation and treatment for coronavirus patients. the country has greatly expanded testing stations to include drive-through services and tested about 15,000 people a day.   japan designated covid-19 as an infectious disease in february, making it the government's responsibility to pay inpatient bills related to the coronavirus infection.   in britain, about 18,000 people have received free \ntesting since last month, and 382 have been confirmed as infected as of wednesday.   professor dirk pfeiffer, chair professor of one health at city university's jockey club college of veterinary medicine and life sciences, said affordability would hinder the epidemic control efforts.   \"clearly, wherever you have to pay for health care, individuals with mild symptoms in the lower-income groups will hesitate to visit a health care facility, and that may also be the case in some individuals with severe disease. these behaviours will extend the epidemic,\" mr pfeiffer said.   but he said aggressive testing was not realistic in most countries and social distancing would continue to be the most important risk mitigation measure.   \"i don't think large-scale testing is realistic in most countries because of the sheer number of tests required. and even where it is feasible, it will not eradicate the virus from the population. therefore, testing would have to remain risk-based, focusing, for example, on those in contact with known cases,\" he said.   mr pfeiffer said that in western democratic societies, social distancing would be based mostly on voluntary compliance in contrast to china where tests were mandatory under the country's infectious disease control regulations.   \"the consequence of this difference will be that the epidemic will take longer in the countries where social distancing is voluntary,\" he said.   mr ni feng, director of the institute of american studies under the chinese academy of social sciences, said china and the us had different conditions and it was understandable they used different strategies, but china's success in bringing the epidemic under control could be a good opportunity for both countries to work together.   \"this is the least-sensitive area. there are many fields where the two countries can cooperate. we saw some solid cooperation in the past with sars, h5n1 and h7n9 aviation influenza outbreaks, but not this time,\" mr ni said. south china morning post ", "label": 1}, {"content":

", "label": 1}, {"content": "trust in age of covid-19. on monday (march 16), leaders of the group of seven (g7) announced a slew of measures to address the covid-19 pandemic.\u00a0the g7\u2019s emphasis was distinctively on coordination and cooperation, with the measures covering information sharing, global economic relief, and public health.   this can be seen as a lift for the multilateral system, amid the rise of divisive unilateralism among those who do not trust the global governance architecture.\u00a0but the success of the g7\u2019s actions will depend on how much the world trusts its capacity to handle the crisis.   indeed, if there is one word that encapsulates the governance challenge as covid-19 wreaks havoc globally, it would be the word \u201ctrust\u201d.   covid-19 has disrupted every aspect of life in affected countries, raised fears, and sparked uncertainties. yet how people respond reduces to a crucial factor: trust \u2014\u00a0or lack thereof \u2014\u00a0in their neighbours, their healthcare or welfare systems, and their authorities.   when panic-buying or store runs broke out around the world, a familiar pattern played out over and over: people, facing uncertainty and fear, sought safety in stockpiling.   economists who study bank runs are familiar with this pattern: it illustrates an underlying logic of self-preservation amid uncertainty \u2014\u00a0and a lack of trust in the system to prevail.   yet individually-rational actions can lead to systemically-irrational outcomes, or in laymen\u2019s terms: panic.   making sure that a system is fit to meet people\u2019s needs in a crisis \u2014\u00a0and then persuading them of such \u2014\u00a0must therefore be one of the major aspects of tackling the covid-19 outbreak.   domestic trust   leaders need stocks of legitimacy to be trusted in a crisis when so many unknowns abound, and they build these stocks outside of the crisis period.   approval of united states president donald trump\u2019s handling of the crisis follows partisan political lines.   according to aggregate surveys by statistical website fivethirtyeight.com, between 10 and 16 per cent of democrats trusted his handling of the crisis while 75 to 87 per cent of republicans approved of it.   because mr trump domestically has only played to his base, non-republicans simply did not trust him and a litany of his missteps were carefully documented, which will make it harder for him to carry out interventions that are needed.   a leader who senses he lacks trust may also be overly concerned with optics rather than overcoming the situation.   experts also need stocks of legitimacy in order to be heeded.\u00a0unfortunately, this is not as obvious as it should be.   britain\u2019s brexit process had poisoned the well (the british public infamously had had enough of experts, according to british cabinet minister michael gove) and far too much of the population were eager to dismiss expert advice, especially when that advice would be disruptive to everyday life while the virus still appeared distant.\u00a0   put together, there has been a trust deficit that has \nhampered the effective addressing of the crisis.   the turmoil on global stock markets suggests most firms and investors have no trust in the management of the outbreak in major industrialised economies and are pricing in for a hard recession.   international trust   international cooperation also requires trust \u2014\u00a0between countries and with international organisations. when the crisis in wuhan unfolded in january, the us offered to send expert assistance but was rebuffed. one wonders if the reverse will hold true should the crisis escalate in the us and china offers its help.   countries have always devised foreign policies that support their domestic interests and public opinion but doing so is a delicate matter when it comes to close neighbours whose reactions also have domestic impact.   when one country trusts that the other is handling a problem effectively, things are fine.   but when that trust does not hold because of insufficient information, it may be forced to take preventive measures, even at economic cost to itself, if only to assuage domestic pressure.   in the early days of the outbreak in wuhan, several countries risked chinese ire as they announced travel bans from china. yet today, it is china that is now following this logic to place travel restrictions on other countries.   attempts to cover up cases, the slow rollout of testing (and thus lack of information), or ineffectual responses make it difficult for neighbours to trust that others have a handle on the situation. lower trust \u2014\u00a0and therefore raised defences \u2014\u00a0will be inevitable until they come to grips with the situation.   multilateral trust   multilateral cooperation had been brought to its lowest ebb just prior to the outbreak of the crisis.   international organisations such as the world trade organisation are teetering on the verge of collapse, with its dispute settlement mechanism broken.   the us-china trade war, which had only just begun to show signs of abating, had led many countries to hedge against both superpowers.   britain chose to go with huawei in its 5g infrastructure against the us\u2019 wishes, while erstwhile chinese partners were reviewing infrastructure projects on the backs of debt and sustainability fears. a lack of trust in the multilateral system preceded the covid-19 outbreak.   on covid-19, the world health organization was initially criticised in asia for not declaring an emergency earlier in january, sparking a petition with half a million signatures. it did eventually declare an emergency on jan 31, followed by a pandemic on march 11.   however, the emergency declaration on jan 31 seemed to be ignored by those outside asia, and many countries are now paying the price for this. yet one must ask why the who\u2019s warning went unheeded: did it have enough legitimacy and trust to be taken seriously immediately?   rebuilding fractured trust   whatever the case, the pandemic is now upon all of us. national interests around the globe have converged over \ncovid-19 and will require multilateral cooperation to effectively address it, so the g7\u2019s coming together is welcome, though only a first step.   countries large and small, rich and poor, all have the same interest: to quash this disease as quickly as possible. it is also fundamentally a public health issue that can, like pandemics before, be defeated without politicisation.   we are now seeing demonstrable success in singapore, china, and south korea that have effectively nullified the domestic threat of the virus \u2014\u00a0they now appear most impacted by importing it from countries where the virus is still uncontrolled. they have managed systems that are effective and trusted to contain their outbreaks.   while many countries still need to put domestic control measures in place urgently, this is also a rare opportunity to strengthen a troubled multilateral system and should not be wasted.    about the

China's National Health Commission announced this Sunday that the new coronavirus is contagious even during the incubation period, which can last up to 14 days. It is one of the characteristics that makes it difficult to contain the virus that has already killed 56 people in China and infected more than 2000 worldwide (1975 of them in Chinese territory). \"The speed of spreading the outbreak is increasing. I fear that this continues for some time and that the number of cases of infected people still increase \", admitted the Minister of the National Health Commission, at a press conference on the outbreak this Sunday. According to MA Xiaowei, patients with disease without symptoms during the incubation period are making cases multiply more quickly. \"The incubation period rounds at ten days. The lowest detected period was one day and older than 14 days, \"the minister explained, advancing that he is still very little about the functioning of the virus and the risks of possible mutations are not known. The symptoms associated with infection caused by new coronavirus are more intense than a flu and include fever, pain, general malaise and respiratory difficulties. Although there is no healing or vaccine, healthcare can help patients' immune system to fight against the virus. According to data shared by Chinese state television CGTN, there are 49 cases of healed patients, China, so far. Despite the similarities with SARS, another type of coronavirus that appeared in China and killed more than 900 people between 2002 and 2003, the two coronaviruses differ in the fact that SARS only be contagious after incubation and because, apparently, this new coronavirus has a lower mortality rate. According to the information provided by Sunday by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), 31 December 2019, 2026 cases of infection by the new coronavirus, including 15 health professionals were reported and confirmed. Scientists around the world are working on creating a vaccine that can protect from this outbreak, originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan. CEPI, a non-profit global coalition dedicated to develop vaccines to combat new epidemics, is funding three distinct programs to develop vaccines against the new NCOV-2019 coronavirus. Modern and innovative pharmaceutics Pharmaceuticals, USA, and chemistry and molecular bioscience faculty of Queensland University in Australia will receive up to $ 11 million (9.9 million euros) to create vaccines. The new coronavirus represents the first case of an epidemic on a global scale since CEPI was established in Davos in 2017. Researchers are studying the genetic code of the virus that was made available by the Chinese authorities shortly after the outbreak of the New Coronavirus still in December. the first \nVersions of virus vaccines may be ready for human testing within a few months, although the approval for widespread use take longer. In addition to trying to create a vaccine, scientists' work goes by testing if existing antiviral drugs can treat this coronavirus. According to information published in China Daily, Official Journal of the Chinese Communist Party, the country's prevention and control center team has managed to \"successfully isolate the first strain of the virus.\" The news comes at a time when the Chinese authorities warns that the country is at the \"most critical\" point as regards the prevention and control of the virus. At least 13 Chinese cities were placed in quarantine. Bus services were also suspended in several provinces such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Xian, while Shanghai announced the suspension of the train line linking the city center to the Anting district on the border with Jiangsu province. For now, France is the only country in the European Union with confirmed cases. The European Disease Control Center (ECDC) considers the possibility of secondary transmission in the area of \u200b\u200bthe European Union, \"provided that practices for prevention and infection control related to any imported case\" are complied with.

In the past few years, the world survived the world for the civilian in the past few years: Ebola fever, bird and swine flu and, finally, the notorious coronavirus. It turned out that in addition to doctors, the military should now be struggling with him. In New York, according to New York POST, the Army Engineering Corps plans to adapt 10 thousand hotel rooms, rooms in hostels and other similar premises to provide medical care, since the number of infected in the city continues to grow. In general, in the United States, the fighters of the National Guard help to process the territory from possible infection and deal with various manifestations of the epidemic. From last week, the Spanish military came to the streets in Catalonia. They were not attracted even in the midst of the political crisis caused by the desire of autonomy to get out of the country. In Barcelona, \u200b\u200bthey spent disinfection of the airport and seaport. The Egyptian troops of the chemicals are also engaged in sanitary processing of space, streets, metro stations and government agencies Cairo. The Egyptian army is already lossed - Major General Chalated Shaltut, which was part of the General Staff of the country, died of complications after infection with coronavirus. The French army is mainly engaged in ensuring the Commandant hour introduced in a number of cities, quarantine norms and evacuation of heavy patients in Mobile Hospital in Alsace. And this is justified. President Emmanuel Macron says that the country is in a state of war. The German Bundeswehr helps the police and local authorities, and will also contribute to the care of patients. This was promised by the Country Defense Minister Annegeret Krampt Carrenbauer. But in the Italian Bergamo, the military were attracted for sad events: Army trucks took out the coffins in the crematorium.

Military ready \nProvide civilian service products, medical and diet reserves and transfer two military holiday homes and military sanatorium to the Ministry of Health. Experience - the son of mistakes difficult for the Russian army The situation with COVID-19 is not so unusual. In 1959, the efforts of military doctors were stopped by an outbreak of smallpox in Moscow. Forces of specialists of the 15th administration of the Ministry of Defense, which was engaged in the development and testing of biological drugs, a mass vaccination of the population was carried out. For 19 days it passed almost 10 million people. This was the first and most large-scale use of the army in the reflection of biological danger in the USSR. In 1979, the military fought with an outbreak of Siberian ulcers in Sverdlovsk (Yekaterinburg). Subsequently, they actively worked in Afghanistan. As representatives of the Office told, during its existence, about 40 samples of diseases are deadly for human causative agents were studied. They have never been considered as a weapon. Store expensive, because bacteria should be \"feeding\", and you will not get driving a pipette with a pipette. Yes, and the effectiveness of such ammunition is very low - against the background of nuclear weapons, you will get bored until the enemy fell. Nevertheless, work with Siberian ulcers, Tularerey, Chuma and various fevers allowed to create in the USSR, and then Russia Bank \"Antidotes\". However, in 1992, on the wave of democratization, Boris Yeltsin abolished an independent structure that was responsible for biological safety in the country. The only polygon in the Aral Sea on the island of Renaissance was closed. There are no unique virological specialists, which do not first know what epidemics and how to deal with them, transferred to the new structure - the troops of radiation, chemical and biological protection (RHBS). Today, it is them in the Russian army to unite specialists who know how to fight radioactive and chemical pollution, as well as cope with outbreaks of particularly dangerous viral diseases in both military and peacetime. For this, there are special techniques in their composition, as well as research institutes. Such structures are in the US and UK armies. It would seem that Rome could seek help from Washington or London. But allies in the North Atlantic Alliance were self-injured, in fact, giving understanding that Italy would have to deal with their problems independently. One of the reasons is that antidotes are peculiar markers by which the level of biotechnology and those opportunities that have military medicine has a view. In 1991, the Americans asked for a Vaccine from Siberian ulcers before the operation of the \"storm in the desert\". At that time, Iraq was the only country that publicly demonstrated the action of a combat strain of this infection in humans and animals. Moscow refused. Subsequently, the Americans did not give us samples of Ebola fever. By the way, the only country of the world, who refused and actually buried the version of the refined Convention on the Prohibition of Biological Weapons. President George \nBush - the elder called 37 points of the document specifying biolated, types of research testifying to its creation, as well as the equipment necessary for this completely unacceptable for the United States. As a result, the Convention on 210 pages has sunk in the fly. This allows today to do with viruses literally everything. This is evidenced by how they declare in the Ministry of Defense of Russia, the rapid development of American secret biologics in a number of countries in the world. For example, in Ukraine and in Georgia. The front edge of the defense flight to Italy for our virologists is not just a goodwill gesture in the fight against New Chuma. This is an important decision to start fighting on the farthest approaches. In the same way as we did, providing Syria in the fight against terrorists, without allowing the overwhelming infection to our territory. According to Russian biologists, the \"European\" version of COVID-19 is significantly different from the \"Chinese\" option. Its study will allow you to find a means of opposition. By the way, thanks to the interaction with Beijing, we created a system of early diagnosis of the disease. Now it is necessary to find an effective formula of the vaccine for the final victory against the new plague of this century. The head of the troops of radiation, chemical and biological protection, Lieutenant-General Igor Kirillov says that we sent just one brigade out of 15 existing radiation, chemical and biological protection in the troops. These are 20 cars for conducting special processing from more than 2 thousand available at the disposal of the Ministry of Defense, and 66 people from about 20 thousand troops of RHBS troops. Therefore, this will not affect our own combat readiness and safety. \"The sending of military personnel of the troops of radiation, chemical and biological protection and technology in Italy will not have an impact on the combat ability of troops. On the contrary, the servicemen will have extensive experience in eliminating the consequences in another settlement, another area for the benefit of a whole state,\" Kirillov said. According to the Minister of Defense Sergey Shoigu, the Russian army is ready to fight the epidemic of COVID-19 not only on Apennines, but also at home. The Ministry of Defense has already taken a number of preventive measures to counteract the spread of coronavirus. In all medical institutions of the department, specialized infectious offices and laboratories were prepared, interaction with territorial healthcare organizations in the points of permanent dislocation of troops were organized. Precautions affected both existing servicemen and their family members. \"In the Armed Forces, a supply of necessary drugs and drugs was formed, as well as personal protective equipment for the operational provision of qualified medical care. Daily in all military units and compounds measure the temperature in military personnel and civilian personnel. Polls are conducted for early detection of infectious diseases,\" ministry. In addition, our military spent a special teaching to combat the proliferation of coronavirus. They began on the border with China and \nThey will affect the Amur region, Primorye and the Khabarovsk region. In addition to the military attracted police officers, Rospotrebnadzor, firefighters and civil doctors. \"Profile services worked out the interaction in identifying, the transportation of a potentially infected person, the evacuation of passengers, disinfection of premises and transport,\" the press release of the military department says. Something similar passed on the main military airfield - Chkalovsky. Here, as a rule, military transport aircraft with evacuated from abroad by Russian citizens arrive. Shoigu says that the actions of the reception and evacuation of citizens, special processing of aircraft and transported goods were also worked out in the suburbs, the organization of quarantine and disinfection of military unit facilities were decided to normalize epidemo-installations. In addition, on the instructions of the President, the army from March 25 will check the preparedness of units to combat the coronavirus epidemic. \"The purpose of the verification is to increase the level of readiness of the units to solve if necessary to combat coronavirus infection,\" said the Ministry of Defense, emphasizing that all activities will be carried out only on the landfills of Russia.

", "label": 1}, {"content": "What if the solution goes by adapting to the new virus?. Day after day, news bring new cases of infection by the SARS-COV-2 virus confirmed worldwide and remember that the list of deaths also does not stop increasing. But meanwhile, it also gains the discussion among the experts about the possibility of (more day, less day) to adapt to this new reality and learn to live with the new coronavirus. As with seasonal flu, can the next winters come to include Covid-19 as a common disease of the time? Like the virus itself seems to be making its way, the discussion about this international public health problem seems to have reached the point where scientists and experts begin to question whether it will be possible to lock the new coronavirus. \"You will probably have coronavirus\" is the title of a long article published this week in The Atlantic magazine where you advance with the hypothesis that the \"season of colds and influenza can become the time of colds, flu and covid-19 \". Epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch, Harvard University, USA, is one of the experts mentioned in the news and, among other ideas, argues that \"the most likely outcome [of this epidemic] is that this is not something possible to contain.\" The epidemic that has already reached more than 40 countries should soon gain officially gaining the size of a pandemic, believe various experts although it does not use (still) the word \"pandemic\", also the World Health Organization already speaks in \"epidemic in various parts of the world \"that is basically the same as pandemic. Marc Lipsitch estimates that next year between 40 to 70% of people in the world will be infected by the virus that causes Covid-19. So is it a case to panic? not. Incidentally, there are more and more experts to defend precisely otherwise. In the article of The Atlantic magazine experts consider that the new coronavirus can come in the routine of our winters and even, who knows, to have a vaccine as it exists for the seasonal flu that changes every year to respond to virus mutations and to exceed the fact that many people are not able to develop a lasting immunity after an infection. \"Coronavirus seems unstoppable - what should the world do now?\" It is the title of another article published this Tuesday on the SCIENCE magazine website. Recalling the calculations presented by a working group of the Imperial College in London, it refers there that researchers estimate that about two-thirds of China's exported cases have not yet been detected. Christopher Dye, an epidemiologist at the University of Oxford, in the United Kingdom, assumes to be pessimistic and, cited in the article by Science, considers that it is now time to rethink the public health response to this problem. \"The fight now must be to mitigate, keep the health system working and not panic,\" adds Alessandro Vespignani, a specialist in diseases \nInfectious from the University of Northeastern, in the US. \"There is a range of possible results from the equivalent of a bad flu season until something a little worse than that.\" In fact, efforts to contain the outbreak that began in China in December are more than evident in several countries around the world. There are surveillance at airports, borders are open but there are already some reports of supply problems and services in some regions affected by the outbreak in China and even in Europe. For several reasons, many scientists want to keep boundaries open and coach an increase in travel restrictions, defending better use of resources. Why investing so much time and resources to prevent an infected person from entering the country if that country already has several confirmed cases of the disease? We can only postpone the inevitable. But on the other hand, we can also be giving time for science to find some kind of response. If we could choose to now have an infection by this coronavirus and be infected only in six months, when scientists may have found some kind of response, we are able to guess what most people chose. Marc Lipsitch responds in Science's article (where he is also quoted) who chose the second option, although he underlines that travel restrictions can make sense today, but will no longer be a major containment measure. About advances in laboratories Here there are two versions. On the positive side, there is a collaboration at international level never before seen. It is difficult to follow scientific production on the new coronavirus with dozens of articles published every week and open access. The list of companies and laboratories trying to find a vaccine or other type of response is increasingly long. But on the other hand, there are also those who criticize an alleged disinterest of large pharmaceutical companies that hesitate to bet on the long and costly vaccine process at a time of emergency that can stop being at any time (as happened with SARS and MERS ).

Some time ago that experts and public health authorities emphasize that this new coronavirus has (according to available data) a mortality rate of only 2%, which is far below registered with other coronavirus as SARS (9 , 5%) and MERS (34.5%). So what does this virus have special? For already, it has been shown to have the ability to infect a much higher number of people when compared to other coronaviruses. Like seasonal flu, it affects more seriously the elderly and with other associated pathologies. Then, besides the inconvenience of being a new virus with a lot of things unknown to scientists, it still has the disadvantage of having nothing special. that is, \nThe symptoms of the disease (CUVD-19) are especially light and, according to we already know, can not even manifest themselves in infected people.

At the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities of the World Health Organization WHO reported an accumulation of pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause in the Central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the diseases. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. A few days then a group released a group of the virologen Christian's premier from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 the first diagnostic test for the new virus, the researcher provisionally call 2019-NCOV. With the test, the virus can be detected in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, on which, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as well as Mers (MIDDLE East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses which have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more than 750 died. With the MERS virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronaviruses. Many of them relate to respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example.\nIn China, several thousand persons are suffering from them, some of them - most of them with pre-existing conditions - have died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first infection cases outside of China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been in Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection with a tourist, who came back from Wuhan, on January 24, the first cases were known in France. Meanwhile, first cases were confirmed in Germany. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. The virus can cause pneumonia that can endally end. Since it is a viral illness, antibiotics do not help.\nMeanwhile, it is clear that the virus can be transferred from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transfers after a dozen cases were known in medical staff. Medizors assume that the virus is transmitted above all over droplet infection. The World Health Organization calculates, as announced on January 24, at the moment that an infected one cuts 1.4 to 2.5 other people. Contest these numbers, the virus is less contagious than SARS and also the viral flu. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThat can not be said yet. The World Health Organization said on 28 January that about one-fifth of the reported cases through the virus will be seriously ill, so in case of doubt must be treated intensive care. According to reports, the first death pots were patients who had some severe pre-existing conditions. Even with other infectious diseases, people with pre-existing diseases are particularly endangered - for example at the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so change their genome. This can cause you to become more dangerous for people in the course of an outbreak - but also to the exact opposite.

journalists at three u.s. newspapers, intensifying a bitter fight between the world\u2019s top two economies that has widened to include the coronavirus outbreak and media freedoms. beijing announced on wednesday what it said was retaliation against u.s. restrictions on chinese journalists that includes revoking the accreditations of american correspondents with the new york times (nyt.n), news corp\u2019s (nwsa.o) wall street journal and washington post whose credentials expire by the end of 2020. the move is a sharp escalation of a dispute that saw washington last month force chinese state media firms to register as foreign embassies. beijing then expelled three wall street journal correspondents - two americans and an australian - following an opinion column by the newspaper that called china the \u201creal sick man of asia.\u201d washington then slashed the number of journalists permitted to work in the united states at four major chinese state-owned media outlets to 100, from 160 previously. it cited a \u201cdeepening crackdown\u201d on independent reporting inside china. beijing said the expelled journalists would not be permitted to work in mainland china, hong kong or macau. it said they must hand back their press cards within 10 days. the expulsion is expected to affect at least 13 journalists, according to the foreign correspondents club of china, which said it \u201cdeplores\u201d china\u2019s decision. china\u2019s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment on how many journalists are affected. beijing also said the china branches of the three papers plus the voice of america broadcaster and time magazine must \u201cdeclare in written form information about their staff, finance, operation and real estate in china.\u201d the latest development follows a war of words between washington and beijing over the outbreak of the new coronavirus, which causes a highly contagious, sometimes fatal, respiratory illness covid-19. the virus originated in the chinese city of wuhan late last year and has so far killed 7,400 people globally, bringing normal life in many parts of the world to a standstill. u.s. secretary of state mike pompeo told reporters at a state department news conference that beijing\u2019s move on wednesday would deprive the world and the chinese people of information in \u201cincredibly challenging\u201d times brought about by the coronavirus. \u201ci regret china\u2019s decision today to further foreclose the world\u2019s ability to conduct the free press operations that frankly would be really good for the chinese people,\u201d he said. \u201cthis is unfortunate... i hope they\u2019ll reconsider.\u201d media executives denounced the move. \u201cwe unequivocally condemn any action by china to expel u.s. reporters,\u201d washington post executive editor marty baron said in a statement. \u201cthe chinese government\u2019s decision is particularly regrettable \nbecause it comes in the midst of an unprecedented global crisis, when clear and reliable information about the international response to covid-19 is essential.\u201d dean baquet, executive editor at the new york times, also condemned the decision. \u201cit is a grave mistake for china to move backwards and cut itself off from several of the world\u2019s top news organizations,\u201d he said. matt

deeply on china is unchanged.\u201d time editor in chief and ceo edward felsenthal said: \u201cwe oppose any effort by the chinese government or any other government to expel reporters or intimidate those whose job is to provide accurate information, especially during this crucial period for the world.\u201d a representative of voice of america was not immediately reachable. a striking aspect of beijing\u2019s move was its decision to bar the journalists from working in hong kong and macau, two semi-autonomous territories of china with their own media accreditation rules. in the past, foreign journalists kicked out of china were allowed to work in hong kong. that raised questions about hong kong\u2019s autonomy under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d agreement that still prevails between the territory and the mainland. \u201cthere\u2019s no precedent for china dictating who can and can\u2019t report from hong kong openly,\u201d said steven butler, the committee to protect journalists\u2019 asia program coordinator. \u201cit very seriously erodes hong kong\u2019s autonomy and freedom of the press.\u201d the foreign correspondents\u2019 club in hong kong said it was alarmed at the decision to expel the journalists and even more concerned that they would be banned from working as journalists in hong kong. it said hong kong must provide assurances that foreign journalists working in hong kong and those applying to work in the city will continue to be issued employment visas without interference from the chinese government. beijing said on wednesday that its actions \u201care entirely necessary and reciprocal countermeasures that china is compelled to take in response to the unreasonable oppression the chinese media organizations experience in the united states.\u201d pompeo said he did not think beijing\u2019s latest move was a balanced response. \u201cthis isn\u2019t apples to apples,\u201d he said, charging that the chinese journalists who had faced restrictions were part of \u201cpropaganda outlets.\u201d china has repeatedly denounced the wall street journal\u2019s \u201csick man\u201d column as racist and, after the newspaper declined to apologize, revoked the visas of the three reporters in beijing. another reporter with the paper had to leave last year after china declined to renew his visa.

It was more or less inevitable than one of the most popular false news in the world released by Twitter about Covid-19 involved Chinese and Americans. To believe in the news, the virus responsible for the pandemic was not originated in China, but in the US. This information is at the top of a total of 3180 tweets produced last week and identified as suspected of disclosing coronavirus-related lies by a Fake News Automatic Extraction System designed by the Faculty of Port Sciences and the Systems Engineering Institute Computers, Technology and Science (INESC TEC).\nAccording to Nuno Guimar\u00e3es, a researcher who proposed to develop this system, the increase of Fake News on the pandemic on Twitter has been exponential. The preliminary results show that there was a jump of 157 suspicious tweets in the first week of February to 658 between February 16 to 23 and 3180 already last week. And the trend is to continue to rise.\nStatistics refer to tweets produced in English around the world. In development since the end of 2018, it is the first time that this software is applied to a specific event. Initially, the system managed to detect Fake News also on Facebook, but began to limit twitter after Zuckerberg's social network blocked the possibility of extracting these data in a massive way. Also WhatsApp was out of the radar because it is a private medium, only accessible to those who are directly involved in the exchange of messages. To work around the problem, a Medialab team, on iL-IUL, specializing in Fake News, created a number of whatsapp on purpose for this purpose and started receiving messages as if it were an individual user. A last week report on the results of the centered analysis on the first days of the pandemic concluded that audio files are most popular in WhatsApp. \"They are very effective because there is emotion contained in the intonation as the information is transmitted,\" says researcher Gustavo Cardoso. A fact-checking made by the team to the 10 most shared files concluded that seven of them contained incorrect facts.\nIn the experience made with Twitter, \u00c1lvaro Figueira, a professor at the Faculty of Sciences of Porto, explains that although it is not possible to guarantee 100% that all situations identified by the system correspond to false information, the degree of probability is very high, A complex combination of parameters, including measuring the emotion level associated with each tweet. \"Fake News have a very own record. They usually use stronger adjectives and are more alarmist. \" But the most reliable criterion is related to the sites for which tweets refer and that have been referenced as \"unreliable\" because they present a false news history.\nAmong the most popular fake news posts running on Twitter is the idea that vitamin C has been used in high doses as effective remedy; The thesis that coronavirus is a combination of several viruses, including HIV, or that there is no limit to the number of reinfections.\nIn the case of the revelation that after all the virus originated in the USA, the Tweet (refurbished after 782 thousand times) was associated with a link that refers to a supposed research center in Canada, where an article presents alluded evidence, including New York Times News of 2019. The thesis: coronavirus is a biological weapon of American manufacture. Days later, Buzzfeed released that one of the people who had released Tweet was the spokesman's owner of the Chinese Foreign Minister. \" ", "label": 1}, {"content": "Like the new coronavirus in Germany foot touched.\nThe team refers to Camilla Rothe from the Universitylinikum M\u00fcnchen in the \"New England Journal of Medicine\" (\"NEJM\") on two peculiarities: On the one hand, the Chinese employee, which caused the outbreak, felt at that time at most nonspecific symptoms. On the other hand, there is the possibility that people could still be infectious even after their recovery.\nThe source of the pathogen was - as known - a woman from Shanghai, who visited the automotive supplier Webasto in Bavaria from 19 to 22 January and participated in company meetings. A later survey revealed that she felt a little warm on January 20, but not feverish. To be fit the next day, she took a tablet. On the 21st she was tired afternoon and had light muscle aches on pressure. On the day of their departure, they shivered in their light business clothes until they dressed a scarf.\nOnly on the evening of January 23, she felt really ill, and had a temperature of about 38 degrees, which rose to 38.7 degrees until the evening of the next day. According to the authors, she was positively tested on the pathogen on 26 January. On the 27th, she informed the company about her illness, whereupon your contacts were checked - even in Bavaria.\nMeanwhile, the first German patient had noticed a 33-year-old Webasto employee, according to the report on 24th January sore throat, shivering and muscle aches. One day later, cough and 39.1 degrees fever followed. On the evening of the 26th of January he felt better and returned to work on the 27th before the pathogen was proven to him.\nOn January 28, three other employees of the company were tested positively - but only one of them had had contact with the Chinese in the study. The other two employees would have infected with the 33-year-old, writes the team to which in addition to Munich physicians also the Coronavirus expert Christian Riding is counted by the Berlin Charit\u00e9. In addition, the 33-year-old genome of the coronaviruses had been proven when he felt healthy again.\n\"The fact that persons without symptoms were possible sources of 2019-NCOV infection may justify a new assessment of the transmission dynamics of the current outbreak,\" writes the team. \"In this context, the proof of 2019-NCOV and a high virus load in sputum in a recent patient is ensured by a spread of 2019-NCOV after recovery.\"\nHowever, the functioning of the proven viruses must be shown in the laboratory, emphasizes the team. The researchers report that the four German patients described in the study had only a slight symptom. They were only treated for concern for public health in hospitals. In total, 13 cases were demonstrated in Germany by Friday: Eleven of it in Bavaria are related to the departure described. Two more people brought back from China are treated in Frankfurt / Main.

  wages account for a significant portion of \nbusiness costs and serious consideration should be given to reducing the central provident fund (cpf) contribution rates.   while unpalatable to many singaporeans, such a measure was taken during significant economic\u00a0downturns in 1986, 1999 and 2003 before the cuts were gradually restored.   another tool is the lowering of the salary ceiling for cpf contributions from the current s$6,000 to a lower sum. this would again help reduce overall wage costs.   again, there was a precedent for this. it was cut from s$6,000 to s$5,500 in 2004, then s$5,000 in 2005 and s$4,500 in 2006, before being restored to s$6,000.   finally, in 2010, for 1.5 years, the government used past reserves to help pay 9 per cent of employers\u2019 cpf contribution rate. this helped to prevent a drop in overall income for employees yet\u00a0provided relief to employers.   we think that it is a matter of time before the government will again use past reserves to pay for part of employers\u2019 cpf contribution rate as an enhancement to the job support scheme.   freelancers and gig workers, largely left out of the original budget, should stand to gain some income support as well.   another issue we would like to discuss is making good use of excess labour during downturns by sending these workers\u00a0for training and skills upgrading.   today, a company can tap the skills redevelopment programme to defray the wage cost of 80 \u2013 95 per cent of workers for certain training.   however, these are subject to wage caps. increasing the wage cap or removing it altogether for a fixed period of time would greatly incentivise employers to send their excess workers for training rather than retrenching them.   that said, the singapore government should also ensure that there are sufficient training resources to absorb the increase in training demand.   we feel that this is also a good time to think about our strategy on wage reform. in the aftermath of the 1985 recession, the national wages council (nwc) had urged firms to move from a seniority-based wage system to a flexible wage system.   following the 1997 asian financial crisis, nwc urged firms to move from a flexible wage system to a monthly variable component (mvc) and annual variable component (avc) system.   but the mvc seldom exceeds the recommended 10 per cent of the wage cost on a monthly basis as employees generally resist having a high percentage of their pay based on variable components.   the basic idea of a mvc is that when there is a downturn, employers can remove the mvc to protect jobs.   currently, the most employers can remove is 10 per cent of the wage cost. this is not enough to deal with the current covid-19 crisis.   going forward, we should continue to urge firms to adopt the mvc/avc system and to increase the mvc/avc proportion of salaries.   this would enable the government and the nwc to reduce labour cost by recommending the removal of part or whole of the mvc during a crisis.   we believe that the experience of covid-19 would \nnudge employees to accept a higher percentage of mvc to prevent retrenchments in future crises.   nowadays, we seldom talk about wage reform, perhaps because employees and employers believe that in a major crisis like the present one, the singapore government would save jobs through rebates and wage support schemes.   with the last significant report on wage restructuring in 2003, it may be a good time to rethink ways of wage competitiveness and factor in safeguards in view of the rise of freelancers and gig workers in the economy.   there is no easy cure to the impending global recession and singapore would need drastic measures to ride out the storm but doing more to save jobs is the correct first initiative.   it is very important for employers to maintain\u00a0employment now as singapore\u2019s fundamental economic structure is sound.   once the covid-19 situation is over, we believe that demand for our goods and services will be restored rapidly.   employers who keep their workforce intact will reap the benefit of a fast economic recovery. investing in wage cuts and sending workers for training on absentee-payrolls will ultimately pay good dividends for singapore.   \u00a0   about the authors:   chew soon beng is adjunct senior fellow at the s. rajaratnam school of international studies, nanyang technological university (ntu), where he was previously professor of economics and industrial relations. wong kuo yheu keith is pursuing a masters of public administration at ntu\u2019s nanyang centre for public administration.

A few days then a group released a group of the virologen Christian's premier from the Berlin Charit\u00e9 the first diagnostic test for the new virus, the researcher provisionally call 2019-NCOV. With the test, the virus can be detected in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, on which, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected. Both the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as well as Mers (MIDDLE East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by coronaviruses which have their origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more than 750 died. With the MERS virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronaviruses. Many of them relate to respiratory tract and can cause colds, for example. In China, several thousand persons are suffering from them, some of them - most of them with pre-existing conditions - have died of pneumonia as a result of the virus. The first infection cases outside of China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travelers who had previously been in Wuhan. On January 21, US authorities reported the first infection with a tourist, who came back from Wuhan, on January 24, the first cases were known in France. Meanwhile, first cases were confirmed in Germany. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. The virus can cause pneumonia that can endally end. Since it is a viral illness, antibiotics do not help. Meanwhile, it is clear that the virus can be transferred from person to person. Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transfers after a dozen cases were known in medical staff. Medizors assume that the virus is transmitted above all over droplet infection. The World Health Organization calculates, as announced on January 24, at the moment that an infected one cuts 1.4 to 2.5 other people. Contest these numbers, the virus is less contagious than SARS and also the viral flu. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals. That can not be sure yet \nto say. The World Health Organization said on 28 January that about one-fifth of the reported cases through the virus will be seriously ill, so in case of doubt must be treated intensive care. According to reports, the first death pots were patients who had some severe pre-existing conditions. Even with other infectious diseases, people with pre-existing diseases are particularly endangered - for example at the flu. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so change their genome. This can cause you to become more dangerous for people in the course of an outbreak - but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) expects no similar mortality to the current time as the outbreak of SARS. The virus has not only spread within China. In numerous other countries in the East Asian room, cases have meanwhile registered in mostly single-digit altitudes. The US also recorded an infected person, on Friday three infected people were registered in France. In Australia, the number of infected most recently has increased from one to four people. Numerous countries now carry out controls at airports, some countries also prepare evacuation measures. According to the Chinese authorities, Russia speaks to the Chinese authorities to bring Russian citizens from Wuhan to safety. In Russia, no infections have been found so far.

The National Microbiology Center (CNM) has confirmed this Friday the first positive in Spain for the Wuhan Coronavirus, which has already left 259 dead and more than 11,000 affected around the world. The Ministry of Health has reported that it is one of the five samples it had received from the Gomera. The patient is entered and isolated at the Hospital Our Lady of Guadeloupe on the island. The protocol was activated after an alert from the Ministry of Health so that two tourists who had been in contact in Germany with a patient diagnosed with CORONAVIRUS 2019-NECOG. Once located it extended to three other people with whom they were living on the island, according to the Canarian government, which has added that the symptoms of all of them are mild. Until now, the CNM had analyzed a total of 12 samples, plus the five that came from the Canary Islands. They had all given negative. The fact that there is a positive case falls within the possible scenarios with which the Ministry of Health was. It was likely that some infected traveler develops symptoms, as has already happened in 19 other countries. This fact, pointing sources of the ministry, does not represent a greater alert in the country and the risk that the epidemic is extended by Spain remains very low. Since the disease was detected in China, at the end of December, it began to jump to other regions. The vast majority of cases and deaths (90%) have been located in Hubei, Wuhan Province, outbreak epicenter, declared quarantine. Later, on January 13, the virus was detected in Thailand, the first case abroad. From there, positives have been detected in Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, United Arab Emirates, Philippines, India, Australia, United States, Canada, France, Finland, Germany, Italy and, now, Spain. The rapid ascent of the number of cases - in just over a month has surpassed the serious acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the most similar background - and the first contagion outside of China - have already registered Not imported into Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, Taiwan and Vietnam - led to the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the international health emergency on Thursday. This measure allows the body to coordinate actions and make recommendations to countries, although at the moment they have not changed substantially with respect to before the global alarm. It has been ruled out to advise countries that restrict trade or travel to China. In Spain this alert has not modified the measures that were taking. There was already a protocol established in case a person sick to isolate it and avoid possible contagions. Each autonomous community has decided if you select hospitals \nSpecific to treat the patient or do it in any one. In principle, as explained several times Fernando Sim\u00f3n, director of the Emergency Health Coordination Center, all are prepared: \"Ideally a negative pressure room would be, but it is not necessary.\" These are habitats in which the interior pressure is always lower than outside, so that air can never come out of them. Ventilation is done through filters that do not allow any pathogen. This is, however, an extreme precautionary measure. \"Any room well ventilated in a health center can be adequate,\" explains Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Arribas, chief of the Internal Medicine and Specialist in Infectious Diseases of Hospital La Paz. He has not transcended the type of measures that follow in the case of the positive of the Gomera. It is simply known that they are in isolated rooms with restricted accesses, reports Pedro Murillo. The time of convalescence of the patient will depend on the severity of the symptoms. The vast majority of the conditions in China are being mild. Only 20% of those who reach hospitals - are more than likely there are other soments that are not detected - are aggravated. If everything goes well, as happens at the moment with the case of the gomera, the patient will simply have to wait for the disease, without too special care, since there is no treatment against the virus. They can be four to six days of fever and not long after it would receive the discharge, according to arrivals. The problem comes when the respiratory function is affected. \"At that time we need the ability to oxygenate the patient and connect it to a machine that helps him breathe,\" explains the specialist. This is one of the problems with which China has been found, since although the mortality rate of 2019-Ncov is low - it is around 2% and goes down as the crisis advances, while for SARS it exceeded 10 % - ends up being a high number of patients who need this support and can collapse a system. The details that are known from the more than 200 deaths that have been recorded to date are mostly older people who also had previous pathologies. These are the most delicate situations. Care for all serious cases goes by completely monitoring the patient, as in any other disease that requires UVI, with blood pressure control, heart rate, oxygen saturation and other constants that intensate specialists monitor to treat to save the cases that are complicated. In these circumstances an intensivist and a nurse in turn, says Arribas, but \"is not different from the care of any critical [patient], there is nothing special in the case of Coronavirus\". The first positive case of this disease in Spain has coincided with the return to the country of the 21 Spaniards trapped in \nWuhan, who have landed on Friday last Friday at the Torrej\u00f3n de Ardoz airport, in Madrid. All of them have arrived tonight at a bus to the G\u00f3mez Ulla military hospital, dependent on the Ministry of Defense, where they will remain for 14 days at the 17th floor of the center. Health professionals have received a specific course to serve them. To detect the case of the gomera, the previous protocol that exists has been applied to locate potential patients. They are those who have been in the area of \u200b\u200bcontagion or in contact with a person with the disease and, once in Spain, have developed certain symptoms. Health centers and hospitals refer their suspicions to public health, which analyzes the case and decides whether to investigate it. To analyze it it is necessary to take a sample of sputum, which is sent to the National Center of Microbiology in Madrid. There, a polymerase chain reaction test is done, a habitual method for detecting infectious diseases. A machine identifies the pathogen RNA and determines whether the sample is contaminated, as has happened in the gomenera.

(DPA) ", "label": 1}, {"content": "Spanish companies contain the breath before the Coronavirus. One of the characteristics that differentiate the crisis of the Wuhan Coronavirus unleashed at the end of January of the SARS epidemic of the late 2002 is the speed and ease with which it is infected among people. Saving distances, this rapid transmission also affects, indirectly, to the companies present in the Asian country, including the Spanish that operate there. Among the most exposed to the collateral effects of the pathogen, the manufacturers of automobile components, an especially important sector in the province of Hubei, epidemic epidemic, but also suffer their effects of textile, energy, airlines, hotels ... The quarantine to which the zero zone of the outbreak is subjected restricts the movements of people and, thereby, the activity of producing plants, affecting the supply chain of the companies that import merchandise. The only good news for affected companies is that the outbreak has exploded just in the holiday period of the Chinese New Year, one of the most important of the year, during which the manufacturing activity remains at idle. The uncertainty is whether the production can be resumed normally at the end of the holidays - the government has extended them until Monday, February 10 - or if the health crisis lengthens. More information The Coronavirus also threatens the economy in China Portrait of Wuhan, a quarantined city seen from within WHO declares the international alert to the unstoppable coronavirus expansion among the most exposed Spanish companies highlights the case of Gestamp. The manufacturer of components for vehicles has 11 floors, one of them in Wuhan. \"Currently the factories are closed by the Chinese New Year, although the reappearances will depend on how the situation evolves,\" explains sources of the company. Gestamp invoice in China almost one out of every 10 euros of your business and has 4,500 employees in the country. Therefore, each day that the reactivation of the factories is delayed -previsto for February 10, although some companies point out that the Government will prolong it at least five days, it will damage the signature account of the signature. They also have strong presence in China other manufacturers related to the automotive industry, such as the Antol\u00edn Group (18 floors) and CIE Automotive. Sources of the latter explain that they expect the situation to be reconduct. Although they are aware of the difficulty of the crisis and are kept waiting for the decisions of the Asian giant authorities. \"It's still early for us to take some measure because it's still closed for vacation,\" argue spokesmen. The exposition of these firms, therefore, is remarkable. If the risk is taken into account in general, according to the data of the Ministry of Commerce, around the \n9% of the imports carried out by Spain arrive from China (almost 27,000 million until November last year). and around 2% of exports (about 6,300 million euros) have as the Asian giant. \"It's early to have data than it has already affected Spain,\" explains sources from ICEX. Although it is obvious that it will have an impact, especially if the Chinese economy slows down, a blow that should be measured at the time. In terms of transport, Iberia is already suffering. He has had to temporarily cancel his direct route Madrid-Shanghai (three flights a week), while British Airways, also of the IAG group, has suspended all flights to and from mainland China to New Order, as they have finished doing during the Week dozens of airlines (Air France, American Airlines, Delta, Egyptair, Lufthansa, SAS, among many others) and even a country, Iran, which has banned flights from its territory to China. Some of the cancellations are due to the shortage of demand. Few want these days to approach China, if they can avoid it. Amazon has restricted trips to and from China to their employees, except for \"critical reasons\", until further notice, report sources from the Spanish subsidiary, which point out that at the moment it has not seen their operations compromised. The other side of the coin is that of Chinese tourists who want to travel. The impact of the sanitary crisis on tourism is measured on two fronts. On the one hand, that of Chinese travelers who do not come to Spain for the health crisis. Until November, according to the INE, almost 700,000 Chinese travelers had visited Spain, which spent more than 1,600 million euros, according to the China Spain Tourism Association. Although the Chinese New Year is one of the periods in which more Chinese tourists leave the country, not too many Chinese winter (arrived 30,776 in January 2019, compared to 84,000 in August). In this sense, the English Court does not expect to be affected by the outbreak, unless the arrival of Chinese tourists, good clients of their department stores, will be shown drastically or if the crisis extends for many months. On the other hand, there are the effects that the outbreak may have in the Spanish tourism companies present in the country. The Meli\u00e1 hotel chain, for example, manages five establishments in China and admits that they are barely occupied \"as a result of the measures established by the Government.\" All have contingency plans in case the situation is aggravated and the firm has reported that it will not charge for the cancellation of reserves. In any case, it foresees a \"very limited\" economic impact. Nor does it provide great impacts, the Spanish company of ALSA buses, which operates routes in the country. \"Activity in China is independent. There are two societies [La Espa\u00f1ola and China] without relationship, separated \", asserted a spokesman for Alsa Spain, although she prefers not to give details about the possible impact on the Chinese subsidiary. the \nRestrictions on movements and activity Consequence of quarantine Decreed by Chinese authorities in Wuhan Yes they force Inditex to keep closed the seven stores it has in the city (four Zara, two pull & Bear and a Bershka), all of them in shopping centers . Its operative will not be resentful, since, in addition to the holiday paron, the more than 400 Chinese suppliers of the Galician textile giant are mainly of basic garments, whose orders are made well in advance. Also handle has closed its 26 stores and the logistics center that has at least until day 9. With regard to the food industry, it could be thought that it would not have been affected by the virus. However, Santiago Mart\u00edn, president of Ferm\u00edn sausages, tells that some clients are calling for delayed orders in some administrative procedures in customs: \"Every day that a product passes in a port or airport is money,\" he says. \"At the moment, it is only a logistical problem, we hope it does not become a commercial,\" that is, on the cancellation of orders, if the crisis lengthens. Bodegas Torres, with a strong presence in China (there has 180 employees), has declined to respond to this newspaper. Among the energetics, as well as telephone, the impact will be reduced according to the signatures themselves. In the case of the teleco, because its presence is almost testimonial. and the energetics because their exposure leaves them either in a situation of vulnerability. \"Our presence in China is small, it is limited to a chemical plant, in a Joint Venture, and distribution of lubricants,\" explains repsol sources. However, the one that does have a greater exhibition is Siemens Gamesa: it has two factories and 1,320 employees in the country. \"We are following all the recommendations of WHO and the Chinese Government,\" they say sources of the company that they expect the coup to be mild.

", "label": 1}, {"content": "what we don\u2019t yet know about coronavirus. it has been only three months since reports first emerged from china of an unknown virus causing unusual cases of pneumonia, and scientists and public health experts already know more about it and how it works than at the same point in earlier outbreaks.    but there's still a lot they don't know.    as the new coronavirus continues to spread around the world, here are some of the most important questions researchers and doctors \u2013 as well as policymakers and economists \u2013 are still trying to answer:       how contagious is the virus?    the virus spreads from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth via coughing or sneezing, according to the world health organization (who). it can persist on most surfaces up to several days, so in addition to directly inhaling the virus, you can become infected by touching something that has been contaminated and then touching your own nose, mouth or eyes. there is some evidence that virus particles in the feces of an infected person can transmit the disease through contact, but that remains unconfirmed.       how many people are infected, and how many do not show any symptoms?    so far, more than 550,000 cases have been reported worldwide, of which more than 127,000 have recovered and more than 24,000 have died. some researchers estimate that up to 80% of people who are infected show no or only mild symptoms and may not even know they are sick. that would put the number of people who might have been infected in the millions. but we need many more studies and much more testing to close in on a more accurate number.       graphic: tracking the spread of the coronavirus, https://graphics.reuters.com/china-health-map/0100b59s39e/index.html       are younger people less likely to die from the virus?    younger people, while less vulnerable, can still develop covid-19 - the disease caused by the sars-cov-2 coronavirus - severe enough to require hospitalization. just how much safer they are is still unanswered. the who says older people with pre-existing conditions - such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, high blood pressure, diabetes and heart disease - appear to develop serious illness more often than others, while a u.s. health official said the mortality rate in males appears to be twice that of women in every age group. health officials have cautioned that anyone with those underlying conditions, as well as those with weakened immune systems, are at increased risk.       can people be re-infected?    this is a key question \u2013 and we don't yet know the answer. there are a handful of cases of possible \"reinfection\" in recovered patients. but most scientists believe those are more likely to have been relapses. a patient may feel better and test negative for the virus in their nose and throat, while the virus remains elsewhere in their body. fully recovered patients have antibodies in their blood that should protect them from fresh \ninfection, but we don't know how long those antibodies will last. with some viruses, antibodies fade faster. even if they do persist, sars-cov-2 might undergo small changes over time, as flu viruses do each year, rendering the antibodies ineffective.    several academic laboratories and medical companies are looking to produce blood tests to figure out who has been exposed to the virus and whether some people have developed immunity. serological testing will also give a better picture of the full extent of the pandemic.       do we know when there will be treatments or a vaccine?    no. so far there are no vaccines or antiviral medicines specific to the new coronavirus. treatment for now focuses on relieving symptoms such as breathing assistance. companies around the world are racing to develop vaccines. a few have launched early safety testing in humans, but experts say it could take a year or more to develop and test a vaccine. another complication: viruses can mutate quickly. some scientists have already identified subtle changes since sars-cov-2 emerged in wuhan, china, in december. but recent studies show the virus is relatively stable, which suggests vaccines should still be effective when they become available.       does the virus spread more slowly in hot places?    some experts had hoped that the onset of summer will naturally slow the virus. but the european centre for disease control said on wednesday that it is unlikely to diminish its spread. the who has also said that the virus can be transmitted in all areas, including hot and humid climates.       how long will the pandemic last?    we don't know. it will depend on a range of factors, from how long people continue to isolate and avoid group gatherings to when effective drugs or a vaccine become available. president donald trump said this week that he hopes to \"reopen\" the u.s. economy by easter sunday on april 12. but he has faced criticism that such a timetable is too rushed and could lead to more people dying. in hubei province, the epicenter of china's coronavirus outbreak, life has started to return to normal after two months of lockdown. it remains to be seen whether such a return to normal spurs another outbreak.       does the amount of exposure to the virus determine how sick someone gets?    viruses enter the body and infect cells, using them as factories to make many millions of copies of themselves, so the number of virus particles that first enter the body has little effect on the eventual amount of virus in the system. at the same time, more frequent exposure does increase the chance that the virus will enter the body in the first place.       when will the economy return to normal?    the international monetary fund expects the pandemic will cause a global recession in 2020 that could be worse than the one triggered by the 2008 financial crisis. the depth of a recession, how long it will last and the nature of the recovery are a matter of debate. economists say it \nwill largely depend on how long the lockdowns last \u2013 around a quarter of all humanity is currently in lockdown \u2013 and how far government support goes in helping individuals, businesses and markets survive the crisis.       are the trillions of dollars in emergency spending helping?    central bank measures have sought to keep financial markets functioning, including areas that keep the real economy humming, such as the markets where companies go to raise short term cash to pay staff and where cities go to raise money for roads and schools. steps taken by governments, such as the $2 trillion u.s. stimulus package, are expected to further help the economy by putting cash in the hands of individuals and providing additional funding to small businesses and companies. such measures still need to work through the system, however, and it remains unclear whether they will be enough.       is it a good time to invest?    some investors and bank strategists are starting to look at whether people should buy back into the world's stock markets, which have plunged some 25% from their highs in february. u.s. hedge fund manager bill ackman said this week he had turned increasingly positive on stocks and credit and was \"redeploying our capital in companies we love at bargain prices that are built to withstand this crisis.\" but with all the uncertainties, many more analysts and investors remain shy about calling the bottom of the market.       graphic: covid-19 in the united states, https://graphics.reuters.com/health-coronavirus-usa/0100b5k8423/index.html reuters ", "label": 1}, {"content": "new york

invisible threat rather than billowing smoke or blowing snow, new yorkers were still gathering in large groups in parks, playing basketball or having block parties. cuomo expressed exasperation sunday

toll that experts from the world health organization say is almost certainly under-reported. in many parts of the united states, officials were sounding the same not that new york leaders were: stay away from other people. officials called them different things social distancing, sheltering in place, or in the case of \nnashville, tennessee, a safer at home order. we\u2019re all in quarantine

for the poor, for migrants, we need ways to get money to them. but we also need to keep firms alive, firms which have suffered shock aftershock, we need to keep them from closing down, if they are viable. and that decision is a careful one because we can't keep every firm alive given that we have limited resources but we should keep the viable ones alive so that they can reopen, similarly for the large firms,\" he said. dismissing the idea that the indian government should mull rolling out a universal minimum wage to solve the problem, the economic expert said that the government cannot be thinking about long-term measures at the moment. \"temporary income support is possible but beyond that, we don't have the money. this is not the time to discuss universal basic income,\" he said. infuse liquidity  raghuram rajan said that the indian financial system was an impaired financial system which was evident from the fact that the 'central bank is currently unable to provide credit support to businesses'. \"the government should provide partial guarantees to make sure banks continue lending to small and medium business enterprises and to large businesses, but we have to be careful as we have limited fiscal space so there has to be some incentive for the banks to also to take credit risk into account,\" raghuram rajan suggested. rajan said that the rbi should take a cue from the central banks across the world which are contributing to solving the problem by easing liquidity. \"liquidity should not be a constraint, instead the central bank should be \nhelping in credit,\" he said, adding that credit will have to distributed with caution so that india's staggering npas do not rise further. communicate clearly  the ex-rbi chief urged the indian government to communicate with the public clearly that it is a national emergency. \"people must know that it is something that is affecting everyone,\" he said. \"if it has not happened to you right now, does not mean it won't happen to you tomorrow,\" raghuram rajan said, adding that the people must be encouraged to follow the protocol for the safety strictly. additionally, he asked the government to issue correct and detailed data of infections across the country so that timely interventions can be introduced. \"india needs to step up testing and do mass testing and release the data so that state governments can intervene and provide solutions,\" raghuram rajan said. alert young crowd  raghuram rajan said that the most common problem across the globe was that young people were not taking the problem seriously. they are assuming that they are not at risk, but they could be the carriers, he said. \"india must make sure that young people are alert and aware of the risks of possible transmission disease. everyone must be encouraged to follow good hygiene habits to ensure the curb on the spread of the disease. parts of india go under lockdown the central and state governments on sunday announced lockdown in about 80 districts in the country where at least one confirmed case of covid-19 was reported. the districts where lockdown was announced include 10 districts each in maharashtra and kerala, six districts each in uttar pradesh and gujarat, five each in karnataka and haryana, three each in tamil nadu and punjab. meanwhile, s&p global ratings on monday cut its estimate for india's gdp growth for the next fiscal to 5.2 per cent from its earlier estimate of 6.5 per cent, which further worsened the market sentiment that has been already reeling under the coronavirus spread. in the global market, bourses in china, hong kong and south korea plunged up to 5 per cent, while those in japan ended on a positive note. bourses in europe sank up to 4 per cent. the number of global covid-19 infections has shot past 3,00,000. worldwide fatalities topped 14,000. cases in india spiked to 480 with at least nine deaths.

While China intensifies the measures to control the transmission of the Wuhan Coronavirus, which has caused the death of 56 people and infected more than 2,000 in this country, something else is known about the nature of the pathogen. The bad news: the virus's contagion ability seems to become stronger, as the Minister of Health, Ma Xiaowei has pointed out, so the number of affected will continue to grow at the moment. The good news: So far, Chinese scientists have not detected clear signs of mutation (although they do not discard it in the future). And they have already begun to develop a vaccine. In a crowded press conference in the center of Beijing, in which the vast majority of journalists were covered with protective masks, the minister recognized that what he knows about the new Coronavirus 2019-NECOV is still very limited. Unlike the virus causing SARS, with which he is related, he can contagate during the incubation period - from one to 14 days - during which the carrier still does not present symptoms. Another difference with respect to that epidemic of 2003 that left almost 800 dead around the world: then, the infection took between three or four months to become an epidemic. This time you have only needed one month. \"Human beings adapt to viruses and get sick less. They also adapt to us, \"said the director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Fu Gao, also present in the call.

Since the outbreak is not yet under control, China will continue to strengthen and adjusting its control measures against the epidemic, the Minister, one day after the Chinese President, Xi Jinping, took the reins of the crisis and gave orders of Do not repair costs to solve it. A key area will be the cancellation of multitudinarian acts and the limits to transport. The latter is especially important: after holidays for the Lunar New Year is about to start the surge of return trips, which can reach 400 million displacements and contribute to the expansion of the virus. At the moment, the Chinese government has opted to decree a general holiday extension. For all, until Sunday, February 2. And for students, probably even more, although the exact dates back to the classroom will announce at the time the Ministry of Education, as indicated by CCTV state television.

More victims in the epicenter The Autonomous Government of Hong Kong has announced that, as of Monday, it prohibits entry into the city of people from the province of Hubei, whose capital Wuhan is the chicenter of the outbreak. The veto affects people from Hubei and whom they have visited the area in the last 14 days, although the government has nuanced that the restriction is not for its connationals, reports Reuters. The Mayor of Wuhan, Zhou Xianwang, has recognized at a press conference that he expects the number of affected in a thousand more in him in the city in the coming days. The authorities are waiting for the results of the almost 3,000 suspicious cases that have detected in the city, according to EP. The mayor has emphasized the pressure that infrastructure is suffering to respond to the Coronavirus and has announced the construction of a specialized hospital to treat patients infected in this city of 11 million inhabitants. Several large municipalities, including Beijing and Shanghai, have already announced since teaching centers will extend at least two weeks school holidays.

As far as possible, it is recommended to avoid displacement; Transport companies will return the cost of tickets without any penalty. In train stations, exchangers and airports, temperature meters and observation zones will be installed for possible suspicious cases. Added to quarantine blocks of a fortnight of cities in Hubei, including Wuhan, the epicenter of infection, these measures have reduced trips by 28.8% with respect to previous New Year seasons, according to the minister of transportation. In addition to limiting the displacement and closing the most affected area, part of the efforts will also be devoted to the treatment of contagious. Wuhan, where most patients are concentrated and that has publicly recognized the scarcity of protective medical material, will receive reinforcements of all kinds. It has already increased by 2,300 its hospital beds, and it is expected that in the coming days you can count on another 5,000 more. In the last 24 hours, more than 2,000 health professionals from the rest of the 30 Chinese provinces have arrived. More than three million masks have also been sent. One of the great problems, as the minister admitted, is the shortage of protective suits. every day \nWuhan, 11 million inhabitants, needs 10,000, and right now, due to new year holidays, factories are only producing 40% of their capacity. In order to complete the necessary number, it has indicated MA, the reserves of the central government and the provinces will be resorted, and the foreigner will be contacted from the exterior the lacking quota. The authorities also try to locate any resident of Wuhan who has left the city in the last two weeks.

The Wuhanians who are outside should go to the closest medical centers for a physical examination, and maintain a home quarantine of 14 days, as the Minister of Health has urged. The governments of several countries have announced their intention to evacuate their citizens of Wuhan and other cities in quarantine. The United States plans to chartered on Tuesday a plane to move from returning to its territory to 230 diplomats and other citizens.

was first reported, will be banned from entering hong kong from monday as china tries to halt the rapid spread of the outbreak. china\u2019s cabinet also announced it will extend the week-long lunar new year holiday by three days to feb. 2 and schools will return from their break later than usual, state broadcaster cctv said. health authorities around the world are racing to prevent a pandemic of the virus, which has infected more than 2,000 people in china and killed 56. a handful of cases of infection have been reported in other countries, including thailand, australia, the united states,  france and canada. no fatalities have been recorded outside china. the mayor of wuhan, which is the capital of hubei province and at epicenter of the outbreak, said he expected another 1,000 new patients in the city, which was stepping up construction of special hospitals. the newly identified coronavirus has created alarm because much about it is still unknown, such as how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. it can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases. china\u2019s national health commission minister ma xiaowei said the incubation period for the virus can range from one to 14 days, during which infection can occur. the lunar new year holiday, traditionally celebrated by hundreds of millions of chinese traveling around the country and abroad to see family, began on friday but has been severely disrupted by the outbreak. ma said china would intensify its containment efforts, which have so far included transport and travel curbs and cancellation of big events. the virus, believed to have originated late last year in a seafood market in wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife, has spread to cities including beijing and shanghai. alibaba\u2019s taobao online marketplace said it has removed sales of face masks from shops that show \u201cunstable prices or false advertising\u201d, as prices for the products surged. the world health organization this week stopped short of calling the outbreak a global health emergency, but some health experts question whether china can contain the epidemic. who director-general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus said he was on his way to beijing to meet officials and health experts dealing with the coronavirus. chinese-ruled hong kong, which has six confirmed cases, will also ban entry from monday to people who have visited hubei province in the past 14 days, the city\u2019s government said. the rule does not apply to hong kong residents. hubei\u2019s governor, wang xiaodong, said on sunday he felt \u201cagonized\u201d and responsible for the outbreak. he described the situation as severe and said medical supplies were still tight. china confirmed 2,051 cases of infection as of 7 p.m. (1100 gmt) on jan. 26, while the death toll from the virus remained at 56, state broadcaster cctv \nreported. airports around the world have stepped up screening of passengers from china, although some health officials and experts have questioned the effectiveness of these efforts. health officials in orange county, california, said a third case had been registered in the united states in a traveler from wuhan, who was in isolation and in good condition. on sunday, china temporarily banned nationwide the sale of wildlife in markets, restaurants, and e-commerce platforms. wild and often poached animals packed together in chinese markets are blamed as incubators for viruses to evolve and jump the species barrier to humans. the new york-based wildlife conservation society called on china to make the ban permanent. the u.s. state department said it will relocate personnel at its wuhan consulate to the united states, while japan was working with china to arrange a charter flight for japanese nationals to return from wuhan. around 50 italians in wuhan and the hubei region were offered transport out. the outbreak has prompted widening curbs on movements within china, with wuhan, a city of 11 million, on virtual lockdown and  transport links all-but severed except for emergency vehicles. health authorities in beijing urged people not to shake hands but instead salute using a traditional cupped-hand gesture. the advice was sent in a text message that went out to mobile phone users in the city on sunday morning. beijing also postponed the reopening of the city\u2019s schools and universities after the lunar new year holiday, state radio reported. hong kong had already delayed the reopening of schools to feb. 17. china has called for transparency in managing the crisis,  after public trust was eroded by a cover-up of the spread of  sars, a coronavirus that originated in china and killed nearly 800 people globally in 2002 and 2003. but officials in wuhan have been criticized for their handling of the current outbreak. \u201cpeople in my hometown all suspect the real infected patients number given by authorities,\u201d said violet li, who lives in the wuhan district where the seafood market is located. illustrating the extent of disruption to life in china, overall passenger travel declined by nearly 29% on saturday, the first day of the lunar new year, from a year earlier, with air passengers down nearly 42%, a transportation ministry official said. many cinemas across china were closed and cruise ship operators canceled some sailings that had been due to leave chinese ports. in hong kong, disneyland and ocean park were closed on sunday. shanghai disneyland, which expected 100,000 visitors daily over the holiday, has already closed.

'my health is fine' some americans on the diamond princess declined their government's offer. \"my health is fine. and my two-week quarantine is almost over,\" tweeted matt smith, questioning why he should want to leave. forty other us passengers tested positive for the virus and were taken to hospitals in japan, said anthony fauci, a senior official at the national institutes for health. in china, authorities have placed about 56 million people in hubei \nunder quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. chinese health officials on monday urged patients who have recovered from covid-19 to donate blood plasma which, they said, can be used to treat others. new cases outside the epicentre region have been declining for the last 13 days. there were 115 fresh cases outside hubei announced on monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. chinese authorities have pointed to the slowing rise in cases as proof their measures are working even as the total death toll reached 1 770. the apparent drop in new cases \"must be interpreted very cautiously\", world health organisation head tedros adhanom ghebreyesus said on monday. concerns remain about global transmission, but who officials cautioned against \"blanket measures\", when the virus is affecting \"a very, very tiny\" proportion of people outside hubei. fears are mounting over passengers on one vessel, the westerdam, who all received a clean bill of health when they disembarked in cambodia - a staunch beijing ally with a threadbare medical system. an 83-year-old american woman who disembarked was stopped by authorities in malaysia over the weekend when she was detected with a fever and later diagnosed as having the virus. there were more than 2 200 passengers and crew on the ship when it docked in sihanoukville, many of whom have now dispersed around the globe. almost 1 000 were still aboard. battering tourism with the virus battering tourism and disrupting global supply chains, experts are fretting about the toll it could take on a fragile global economy. imf chief kristalina georgieva said there could be a cut of around 0.1-0.2 percentage points to global growth but stressed there was \"still a great deal of uncertainty\". on monday us tech giant apple, citing disruption from the virus, said it did not expect to meet its revenue guidance for the march quarter. the company said worldwide iphone supply would be \"temporarily constrained\" and that demand in china had been affected. apple had forecast revenue of $63bn to $67bn for the second quarter to march.

key u.s. public health agency operating inside china, as part of a larger rollback of u.s.-funded health and science experts on the ground there leading up to the coronavirus outbreak, reuters has learned. most of the reductions were made at the beijing office of the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) and occurred over the past two years, according to public cdc documents viewed by reuters and interviews with four people familiar with the drawdown. the atlanta-based cdc, america\u2019s preeminent disease fighting agency, provides public health assistance to nations around the world and works with them to help stop outbreaks of contagious diseases from spreading globally. it has worked in china for 30 years. the cdc\u2019s china headcount has shrunk to around 14 staffers, down from approximately 47 people since president donald trump took office in january 2017, the documents show. the four people, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the losses included epidemiologists and other health professionals. the material  reviewed by reuters shows a breakdown of how many american and local chinese employees were assigned there. the documents are the cdc\u2019s own descriptions of its headcount, which it posts online. reuters was able to search past copies of the material to confirm the decline described by the four people. \u201cthe cdc office in beijing is a shell of its former self,\u201d said one of the people, a u.s. official who worked in china at the time of the drawdown. separately, the national science foundation (nsf) and the united states agency for international development (usaid), the global relief program which had a role in helping china monitor and respond to outbreaks, also shut their beijing offices on trump\u2019s watch. before the closures, each office was staffed by a u.s. official. in addition, the u.s. department of agriculture(usda) transferred out of china in 2018 the manager of an animal disease monitoring program. reductions at the u.s. agencies sidelined health experts, scientists and other professionals who might have been able to help china mount an earlier response to the novel coronavirus, as well as provide the u.s. government with more information about what was coming, according to the people who spoke with reuters. the trump administration in february chastised china for censoring information about the outbreak and for keeping u.s. experts from entering the country to assist. \u201cwe had a large operation of experts in china who were brought back during this administration, some of them months before the outbreak,\u201d said one of the people who witnessed the withdrawal of u.s. personnel. \u201cyou have to consider the possibility that our drawdown made this catastrophe more likely or more difficult to respond to.\u201d the white house declined to comment or respond to \nquestions from reuters regarding the u.s withdrawal of staff in china. the cdc did not respond to detailed questions submitted by reuters about the cuts. it has insisted its staffing levels did not hinder the u.s. response to the coronavirus. \u201cthere are many factors that go into decisions around staffing,\u201d the cdc said in a statement. some health experts were skeptical that more cdc employees operating inside china would have made a difference in stemming the outbreak. beijing has been widely criticized for silencing its own public health officials who warned of a deadly new respiratory disease emanating from the chinese city of wuhan and surrounding hubei province. \u201cthe problem was china, not that we didn\u2019t have cdc people in china,\u201d said scott mcnabb, a former cdc epidemiologist who is now a research professor with emory university. he pointed to china\u2019s censorship as the main culprit in the spread of the pandemic, which has infected at least 435,470 people worldwide, killed 19,598 and upended the global economy. china\u2019s embassy in washington, d.c. declined to comment. the nsf closed all foreign offices in 2018, according to spokesman robert margetta. he said the agency planned on \u201csending teams on short-term expeditions around the world to find ways to increase international collaborations.\u201d a usaid spokesman said the decision to shutter its beijing office was \u201cdue to significantly decreased access to chinese government officials as well as the agency\u2019s position that the chinese model of development is not aligned with u.s. values and interests.\u201d the usda confirmed that it moved a manager position out of beijing. a spokesman said the department has retained an office in china that employs eight people: five americans and three chinese. the office monitors animal disease and helps resolve \u201ctrade-related issues as they occur at chinese ports of entry,\u201d the spokesman said. reuters first reported about changes to cdc staffing in china on sunday. the news agency revealed that the trump administration had eliminated the position of a u.s. trainer of chinese field epidemiologists, who were deployed to the epicenter of outbreaks to help track, investigate and contain diseases. in a press briefing on sunday, trump criticized the reuters story as \u201c100 percent wrong.\u201d yet the cdc acknowledged the position had been cut. the agency said the decision was made because of china\u2019s \u201cexcellent technical capability,\u201d and said the elimination of that post did not hamper the u.s. effort to respond to the coronavirus outbreak. the cdc staffing documents newly reviewed by reuters show a sharp decline in the overall number of employees at the agency in beijing, with 33 out of 47 positions lost. the documents show the breakdown between american and chinese staffers. the number of so-called american \u201cassignees\u201d declined to three positions from eight at the outset of the administration. positions lost included medical epidemiologists and other experts in infectious \ndiseases. the biggest cuts were to positions filled by chinese employees on the u.s. payroll, down to around 10 from 40 over the same period. many of those local hires included medical and disease experts, according to the people who spoke with reuters. \u201clocal staffers stayed even longer at the cdc and had a real depth of knowledge,\u201d one of the people said. \u201cthere\u2019s a loss of deep expertise and institutional knowledge.\u201d the cdc told reuters the three americans currently on staff in china are a country director, an influenza expert and an information technology expert. a temporary deputy director arrived recently, and that job will be filled permanently, the agency said in a statement. in addition, two chinese staffers continue to work on specific public health areas, including the training program, according to the statement. the shuttered usaid and nsf offices in china also had a role in building scientific relationships and combating global disease, according to the four people familiar with the situation. usaid\u2019s beijing office, which was staffed by a senior u.s. officer and two chinese employees, was working on initiatives including multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and malaria, the people said. the office closed in 2019. the nsf office was once led by nancy sung, a respected american scientist who was a key link between the u.s. and chinese scientific communities, according to the u.s. government official who spoke with reuters. the office also employed two local staffers. \u201cshe had far more contacts than most of us,\u201d said the official, who had been in china at the time and was familiar with her role. \u201cshe could have helped maintain vital channels of communication between the two countries which to this day is greatly curtailed.\u201d sung, who is now with the nsf in the united states, declined to comment about the closure of her office in 2018 and referred questions to the agency\u2019s public affairs office. the changes came amid escalating tensions between washington and beijing. trump has long complained that china has stolen millions of american jobs and intellectual property, charges the chinese government has rejected as baseless. the countries have slapped billions in tariffs on each other\u2019s goods. now their leaders are battling to control the narrative over the pandemic. trump has called it the \u201cchinese virus\u201d to keep the focus on china\u2019s role in unleashing the pandemic. china, meanwhile, is trying to assert global leadership by providing aid to italy and other hard-hit countries. over the last two years, the white house has pushed u.s. agencies with a presence in china to de-fund programs there along with the positions to manage them, according to the u.s. official who spoke to reuters. the source said terry branstad, the u.s. ambassador to china and a former republican governor of iowa, tried to remind the white house of the importance of the u.s. presence in china but was told to \u201cget with the program\u201d by an administration official. \u201cthe \nwhite house saw the relationship as one-sided and without benefit to the u.s.,\u201d the source said. a state department spokesman said in a statement that the u.s. embassy in china is \u201cone of our largest, reflecting the many areas of bilateral engagement.\u201d \u201csince ambassador branstad\u2019s arrival, the u.s. mission to china has maintained robust staffing to advance important foreign policy goals on behalf of the american people,\u201d the statement said. \u201cstaffing levels for the numerous federal agencies and sections have, on the whole, held steady and in some cases increased.\u201d after reuters\u2019 story about the elimination of the key cdc position in china ran on sunday, trump\u2019s re-election campaign seized on it for fundraising. in a mass email to supporters, it accused trump\u2019s critics of \u201csiding with the chinese\u201d and helping beijing with a \u201ccover-up.\u201d the cdc on monday told reuters that redfield had decided to add a global health threats program director to its china staff. \u201cat the request of dr. redfield, cdc is continuing to look long term at possible additions to enhance cdc\u2019s 30 plus year presence

outside china have not sent adequate case reports to the world health organisation (who) on time.   the media, meanwhile, suffered an 'infodemic.' instead of battling the coronavirus disease (covid-19), the who and its chief were targeted.   the greatest virus outbreak concern now is to avoid the emergence of any secondary virus clusters, but this critical task has been complicated recently by misguided media coverage and attacks against the who, china and people of chinese descent rather than the virus.   who director-general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus has urged global leaders to stop any stigmatising and hate amid the virus outbreak.   his comments in munich followed reports that people of asian descent have faced discrimination amid virus fears.   \"we will all learn lessons from this outbreak,\" he added, \"but now is not the time for reclamations or politicisation.\"   at the end of january, the who declared the ongoing virus outbreak a \"public health emergency of international concern (pheic)\".   as the who made clear, the pheic declaration was not motivated by the situation in china but by the possible effects of the virus if it spread to countries with weaker healthcare systems.   at the who, the concern was compounded when terms like \"virus outbreak,\" \"epidemic\" and \"pandemic\" got blurred even in reputable international media.   tabloid hysteria contributed to ugly instances of xenophobia, even racism, against people of chinese and asian descent, while leading to bullying in schools, colleges, even universities.   the misinformation on a global scale compelled the who to declare the covid-19 an \"infodemic\" on feb 2.   since media seemed to be shunning their responsibility to correct myths and rumours, the who had to allocate some of its scarce resources to do the job.   stunningly, it took until mid-february for some of the world's largest technology companies - including google, amazon and youtube - to get together when the who hosted a silicon valley meeting to discuss how to clamp down on misinformation about the virus.   the struggle against covid-19 has gone hand in hand with a battle against the who and its executives.   since late january, almost 380,000 people have signed an online petition to the un for the who chief to resign because he allegedly \"solely believes\" chinese outbreak data.   in contrast to those allegations, who chief covid has initiated a review process to study the causes of the virus, while stressing adherence to who guidelines regarding pandemics.   the smear campaign is an ugly d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. in 2017, mr tedros, a high-level ethiopian health executive, succeeded margaret chan as the chief who.   while he was considered highly qualified for the job and an innovative reformer in ethiopia, his candidacy was attacked at the last eve of the who election, \nwhen odd stories surfaced about an alleged cover-up of cholera epidemics in ethiopia.   reportedly, the allegations came from lawrence gostin, a us law professor who advised the rival uk candidate (and has recently resurfaced as a critic of china's virus struggle).   in the un, the african union dismissed the allegations as an \"unfounded and unverified defamation campaign.\" yet, once again, the old smear campaign stories have been recycled in the media.   when attacks against mr tedros went nowhere, the international spotlight focused on who infections hazards director sylvia briand when she stated in early february that \"we are not in a pandemic.\" then she became a target of criticism.   to avoid political intrigues, a pandemic declaration by the who requires strong evidence and relies on a tested six-stage classification.   the last pandemic was the 2009 h1n1 flu outbreak (swine flu), which is estimated to have killed around 150,000 to 300,000 people around the world. in contrast, covid-19 has so far resulted in 4 deaths outside china, despite weeks of diffusion.   in the early 2000s, china's efforts to control severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) were criticised as the disease spread internationally before the global outbreak was subdued.   a decade later, the chinese response to the avian influenza (h7n9) was significantly faster, broadly praised and the disease did not spread widely. with covid-19, as mr tedros has stated, china should be credited with identifying the virus in \"record time,\" sharing its genetic sequence quickly and flagging potential international spread.   yet, international coverage of the covid-19 has systematically focused on china's alleged conduct, while ignoring the actual conduct of many other influential who member states.   this discrepancy prevails even today, despite the news bomb of feb 4, when who chief tedros said it was not china but countries outside china that had proved slow in sharing complete information about cases.   the who was concerned that, even after almost a month of international crisis and global alert, it had received complete case reports for only 38 percent of the cases.   in other words, a whopping three of five member countries had failed to provide adequate information to the who in a timely manner.   those reports were vital to the global organisation so that it could assess the true international scope of the outbreak, while broadening and deepening containment efforts.   \"i don't think it's because they lack capacity,\" mr tedros stated. it would be ideal, he added, if the who received the most up-to-date information, not just from china but the rest of the world.   even though these lost opportunities could result in potential secondary covid-19 outbreaks outside china, international media have not yet asked the tough questions about the belated international cooperation outside china.   instead, international coverage has produced a series of headlines against the who. on feb 5, a \nday aftermr tedros had urged countries to provide complete case reports, the financial times (ft) reported that the influential who emergency committee member and veteran professor john mackenzie \"hit out at beijing's 'reprehensible' response,\" and \"accused china of not reporting coronavirus cases fast enough.\"   the charge was not publicly supported by other committee members, nor by who executives.   moreover, the ft neglected to mention that mackenzie also serves in the australian government's indo-pacific centre for health security, which plays a role in the us-led indo-pacific initiative aiming to contain china's rise, and is the co-chair of a major ngo, whose key partners include the pentagon's defence threat reduction agency, which compete \"against chinese influence.\"   on feb 13, the wall street journal released a front-page story titled \"who criticized for virus response\" that broadened the who criticism.   it relied in part on critical quotes by both mackenzie and lawrence gostin, the china critic who had tried to undermine mr tedros's who candidacy.   free media have a right to critical views, but not to the lack of relevant context. like other interviewees, both were portrayed as independent, neutral observers.   all interviewees represented experts from the us or its allies. not a single major chinese health expert was interviewed.   this pattern has been typical recently even for reputable international dailies. such purposeful selectivity fosters an impression that legitimate expertise is limited mainly to critics of the who.   throughout the outbreak, mr tedros has admirably sought to foster an international battle against covid-19, while garnering funds against future epidemics. \"the virus is a common enemy,\" he said. \"let's not play politics here.\"   as the number of covid-19 cases could exceed 100,000 in a week or two and global resources should be focused on avoiding secondary outbreak clusters outside china, it is the virus that international cooperation and coverage should attack - not the who.   dan steinbock is an internationally recognised strategist of the multipolar world and the founder of difference group. the paper is a member of

an explainer. novel coronavirus, also called wuhan virus, remains an enigma more than a month after its outbreak in one of china's economic hubs, wuhan. doctors and scientists world over have put their heads down to understand the new coronavirus which was first reported to infect humans in december last year.\nin official count, the 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) has infected more than 17,000 people with over 350 deaths. however, some independent researchers have claimed that despite chinese president xi jinping's thrust-statement asking officials to accurately report coronavirus cases, there has been massive underreporting from various cities in china, including wuhanthe epicentre of the outbreak.\nthe independent, and hence unverified, claims put the number of coronavirus infected people in the range of 75,000 as on january 25.\nthe world health organisation (who) has, after initial reluctance, declared the outbreak a global emergency. though more than 99 per cent of coronavirus patients are in china itself, travellers have taken the wuhan virus to other countries as well.\ncountries such as india and the us have imposed restriction on people coming from china. india has put on hold e-visas to chinese people or foreign nationals coming to india from china till further orders. the us has temporarily banned entry of foreign nationals who have travelled to china over the past two weeks.\nall this is aimed at containing spread of coronavirus outbreak in their countries.\nthe novel coronavirus entered human body from a fish and animal market in wuhan, as reported by china. it spreads from one infected human to another through physical contact and droplets inhaled during respiration.\ndoctors, using computer modelling have found that one infected person can spread novel coronavirus to 2.5 persons before she flushes the pathogen out of her/his body. however, the fact that the coronavirus could not be contained despite total shutdown in wuhan has led many to argue that the r0 (the ability to infect) is more than 2.5.\nbased on available evidence, the only good thing about coronavirus outbreak is its comparatively lower fatality rate. in the case of sars outbreak in 2002-03, the mortality rate was around 10 per cent. in the current coronavirus outbreak, through about 25 per cent patients are showing severe respiratory problems, the fatality rate is only around 2-3 per cent.\nbut this comes with a warning that the coronavirus outbreak is yet not in its waning phase. the cases are still rising at a fast pace -- in some regions in china the rate of spread has been reported to be as high as 25 per cent in 24 hours.\nstill, if patients consult doctors in time, coronavirus is much milder than other viral outbreaks.\nin the case of ebola outbreak in africa, the fatality rate was up to 90 per cent. incidentally, common flu, or seasonal fever as it is known in common parlance in india, is estimated to kill around 4 lakh people every year. but its fatality rate is 0.1 per cent.\ncoronavirus becomes dangerous because it is new and key information such as incubation period and ways in which it can spread are not conclusively known. its incubation period is estimated to be anywhere between two and 10 days.\nit is also not certain that a respiratory mask or a face or surgical mask can actually prevent a healthy person from contracting coronavirus. it is curious that the world health organisation does not list wearing mask as a preventive measure in the case of novel coronavirus outbreak.\nfurther, another key aspect whether an infected person who is not showing any symptom of novel coronavirus infection -- cold, cough, pneumonia etc -- can infect another person is not known.\nscientists world over are studying the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus published by chinese authorities in early january. this is expected to give a clue what medicine can work to contain this coronavirus outbreak.\nthere is a catch hereall viruses undergo mutation at a faster pace than other pathogens. the scientific study is anyway expected to lead to vaccine production and animal testing not before one year from now. mass vaccination against novel coronavirus is still a long road ahead.\nthe mysteries surrounding novel coronavirus outbreaks makes spread of wuhan virus a dangerous proposition even though its fatality rate is lower than other epidemic that threatened to become a pandemic.

close to 75,000 individuals globally and caused more than 2,000 deaths, mainly in china, it also left a trail of economic casualties.\u00a0   as the authorities in singapore try to curb the spread of the virus through various measures, such as a travel ban on non-residents who have been to china recently, businesses in the retail and food and beverage (f&b) sectors have borne the brunt of the

continuing us-china trade tensions and e-commerce competition.\u00a0   half-empty malls, streets   with travel restrictions imposed on non-residents who have been to china in the last 14 days, it is

But although there are more people on the street, factories to resume work and even some bottlenecks and reopened cinemas, the new normal is technologically controlled, raises doubts of the experts and is still timid.

eliminated a key american public health position in beijing intended to help detect disease outbreaks in china, reuters has learned.    the american disease expert, a medical epidemiologist embedded in china's disease control agency, left her post in july, according to four sources with knowledge of the issue. the first cases of the new coronavirus may have emerged as early as november, and as cases exploded, the trump administration in february chastised china for censoring information about the outbreak and keeping u.s. experts from entering the country to help.    \u201cit was heartbreaking to watch,\u201d said bao-ping zhu, a chinese american who served in that role, which was funded by the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention, between 2007 and 2011. \u201cif someone had been there, public health officials and governments across the world could have moved much faster.\u201d    zhu and the other sources said the american expert, dr. linda quick, was a trainer of chinese field epidemiologists who were deployed to the epicentre of outbreaks to help track, investigate and contain diseases.    as an american cdc employee, they said, quick was in an ideal position to be the eyes and ears on the ground for the united states and other countries on the coronavirus outbreak, and might have alerted them to the growing threat weeks earlier.    no other foreign disease experts were embedded to lead the program after quick left in july, according to the sources. zhu said an embedded expert can often get word of outbreaks early, after forming close relationships with chinese counterparts.    zhu and the other sources said quick could have provided real-time information to u.s. and other officials around the world during the first weeks of the outbreak, when they said the chinese government tamped down on the release of information and provided erroneous assessments.    quick left amid a bitter u.s. trade dispute with china when she learned her federally funded post, officially known as resident adviser to the u.s. field epidemiology training program in china, would be discontinued as of september, the sources said. the u.s. cdc said it first learned of a \u201ccluster of 27 cases of pneumonia\u201d of unexplained origin in wuhan, china, on dec. 31.    since then, the outbreak of the disease known as covid-19 has spread rapidly worldwide, killing more than 13,600 people, infecting more than 317,000. the epidemic has overwhelmed healthcare systems in some countries, including italy, and threatens to do so in the united states and elsewhere.    during a press briefing on sunday shortly after this story was first published, president donald trump dismissed the reuters report as similar to other stories regarding the cdc that he described as \"100 percent wrong,\" without addressing whether the role had been \neliminated.    u.s. cdc director dr. robert redfield maintained the agency's presence in china \u201cis actually being augmented as we speak,\u201d without elaborating.    in a statement to reuters before the report was published, the cdc said the elimination of the adviser position did not hinder washington's ability to get information and \u201chad absolutely nothing to do with cdc not learning of cases in china earlier.\u201d    the agency said its decision not to have a resident adviser \u201cstarted well before last summer and was due to china\u2019s excellent technical capability and maturity of the program.\u201d    the cdc said it has assigned two of its chinese employees as \u201cmentors\u201d to help with the training program. the agency did not respond to questions about the mentors\u2019 specific role or expertise.    the cdc would not make quick, who still works for the agency, available for comment.    asked for comment on chinese transparency and responsiveness to the outbreak, china\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs referred reuters to remarks by spokesman geng shuang on friday. geng said the country \u201chas adopted the strictest, most comprehensive, and most thorough prevention and control measures in an open, transparent, and responsible manner, and informed the (world health organization) and relevant countries and regions of the latest situation in a timely manner.\u201d    one disease expert told reuters he was sceptical that the u.s. resident adviser would have been able to get earlier or better information to the trump administration, given the chinese government\u2019s suppression of information.    \u201cin the end, based on circumstances in china, it probably wouldn\u2019t have made a big difference,\u201d scott mcnabb, who was a cdc epidemiologist for 20 years and is now a research professor at emory university. \u201cthe problem was how the chinese handled it. what should have changed was the chinese should have acknowledged it earlier and didn\u2019t.\u201d       alert from china\u2019s cdc    alex azar, secretary of health and human services (hhs) said on friday that his agency learned of the coronavirus in early january, based on redfield\u2019s conversations with \u201cchinese colleagues.\u201d    redfield learned that \u201cthis looks to be a novel coronavirus\u201d from dr. gao fu, the head of the china cdc, according to an hhs administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \u201cdr. redfield always talked to dr. gao,\u201d the official said.    hhs and cdc did not make azar or redfield available for comment.    zhu and other sources said u.s. leaders should not have been relying on the china cdc director for alerts and updates. in general, they said, officials in china downplayed the severity of the outbreak in the early weeks and did not acknowledge evidence of person-to-person transmission until jan. 20.    after the epidemic exploded and china had imposed strict quarantines, trump administration officials complained that the chinese had censored information about the outbreak and that the united states had been unable to get \namerican disease experts into the country to help contain the spread.    azar told cnn on feb. 14 that he and cdc director redfield officially offered to send a cdc team into china on jan. 6 but still had not received permission for them to enter the country. hhs oversees the cdc.    \u201cdr. redfield and i made the offer on january 6th - 36 days ago, 60,000 cases and 1,300 deaths ago,\u201d azar said. \u201cwe made the offer to send the cdc experts in to assist their chinese colleagues to get to the bottom of key scientific questions like, how transmissible is this disease? what is the severity? what is the incubation period and can there be asymptomatic transmission?\u201d    days later, the world health organization secured permission to send a team that included two u.s. experts. the team visited between feb. 16th and 24th. by then, china had reported more than 75,000 cases.    on feb. 25, the first day the cdc told the american public to prepare for an outbreak at home, u.s. secretary of state mike pompeo accused china of mishandling the epidemic through its \u201ccensorship\u201d of medical professionals and media.    relations between the two countries have deteriorated since then, as trump has labelled the coronavirus the \u201cchinese virus\u201d - a description the chinese have condemned as stigmatizing. last week, the chinese government announced that americans from three u.s. news organizations, the new york times, washington post and wall street journal, would be expelled from china.       once \u2018friends,\u2019 now rivals    the decision to eliminate quick\u2019s job came as the cdc has scaled back the number of u.s. staffers in china over the last two years, the sources told reuters.    \u201cwe had already withdrawn many technical public health experts,\u201d the same expert said.    the cdc, however, disputed that staffing was a problem or that its information had been limited by the move. \u201cit was not the staffing shortage that limited our ability\u201d it said.    the u.s. cdc team in beijing now includes three american citizens in permanent roles, an additional american who is temporary and around 10 chinese nationals, the agency said. of the americans, one is an influenza expert with expertise in respiratory disease. covid-19 is not influenza, though it can cause severe respiratory illness.    the cdc team, aside from quick, was housed at u.s. embassy facilities. no american cdc staffer besides quick was embedded with china\u2019s disease control agency, the sources said.    china in recent weeks has reported a dramatic slowdown in new cases, the result of drastic containment measures including the lockdown of hubei province, home to 60 million people.    nevertheless, the infectious disease experts who spoke with reuters said, the united states could use people like quick with contacts on the ground, especially if fears of a second wave of infections materializes.    thomas r. frieden, a former director of the cdc, said that if the u.s. resident adviser had still been in china, \u201cit is possible \nthat we would know more today about how this coronavirus is spreading and what works best to stop it.\u201d    dr. george conway, a medical epidemiologist who knows quick and had served as resident advisor between 2012 and 2015, said funding for the position had been tenuous for years because of a perennial debate among u.s health officials over whether china should be paying for funding its own training program.    yet since the training program was launched in 2001, the sources familiar with it say, it has not only strengthened the ranks of chinese epidemiologists in the field, but also fostered collegial relationships between public health officials in the two countries.    \u201cwe go there as credentialed diplomats and return home as close colleagues and often as friends,\u201d conway said.    in 2007, dr. robert fontaine, a cdc epidemiologist and one of the longest serving u.s. officials in the adviser\u2019s position, received china\u2019s highest honour for outstanding contributions to public health due to his contribution as a foreigner in helping to detect and investigate clusters of pneumonia of unknown cause.    but since last year, frieden and others said, growing tensions between the trump administration and china\u2019s leadership have apparently damaged the collaboration.    \u201cthe message from the administration was, 'don\u2019t work with china, they\u2019re our rival,\u2019\u201d frieden said.    trump\u2019s re-election campaign sent out a statement sunday evening dismissing controversy about the cdc's cut as a matter of politics.    \u201cdemocrats are eager to politicize the coronavirus crisis and weaponize it against president trump, the statement said. \u201cin so doing, they're siding with the chinese and

have seen their lives upended by measures to curb the spread of the new coronavirus. normally bustling streets are deserted as families hunker down in their homes. many of those who do venture out try to stay a safe distance from anyone they encounter, even as they line up to buy now-precious commodities like hand sanitizer. parents juggle childcare as schools close, perhaps for the rest of the school year. and restaurants and bars sit empty as more and more convert to delivery-only options. how long will this last? scientists say there isn't a simple answer. \"in many ways, this situation is unprecedented - we're trying to take some actions to curb the spread and timing of this pandemic,\" said stephen morse, a disease researcher at columbia university in new york. yes, there have been past disease outbreaks that scientists can draw some lessons from but, in those cases, the disease was largely allowed to run its course. \"so those models don't precisely apply,\" morse said. months-long battle on monday, president donald trump said the u.s. may be managing the outbreak through july or august. and new york governor andrew cuomo said the state's number of coronavirus cases may peak - not end - in 45 days. the overall message is that the country will be fighting the virus outbreak for a matter of months, at least, not days or weeks. each model of how the disease could spread relies on data and assumptions about population dynamics, demographics, health care capacity and other factors, said rebecca katz, a public health expert at georgetown university. the challenge for designing models of what will happen next in the u.s. is that limited testing for covid-19 means researchers don't know what the starting point is - how many people are already infected. in simplest terms, scientists say that the epidemic will slow when people with infections don't pass the virus on to others. \"basically, if i infect one other person or more ... then the epidemic can take off. if i infect less than one person and everybody infects less than one person, then the epidemic will decline,\" said elizabeth halloran, a disease researcher at the university of washington. based on data from china and from cruise ships, scientists estimate that unless measures are taken to limit the spread, each infected person will infect about 2 or 3 others, leading to an exponential growth of the virus. if the virus makes a jump to new person every two to five days, as scientists calculate, then a single infected person could lead to 4,142 total infections within a month - assuming nothing is done to break chains of transmission. unless such measures are put in place, scientists estimate that between 40 and 80% of the global population could become infected. based on an analysis of data from china, scientists found that the majority of new infections are transmitted by people with mild \nsymptoms who may not even know they're ill, said jeffrey shaman, a public health expert at columbia university. even if most people recover and only a fraction of total infections are severe enough to require hospitalization - about 14%, scientists estimate - the sheer scale of the epidemic will put enormous strain on hospitals, healthcare workers and other patients who may see unrelated procedures delayed. scientists now agree that measures to break or slow the chains of transmission are crucial to ensure that emergency rooms aren't quickly overwhelmed by surges in critically ill patients. if measures like closing schools are successful in slowing disease spread, \"we are going to see a hump instead of a peak\" in new cases, u.s. government disease expert dr. anthony fauci said in a white house briefing. in order words, the number of infections will rise more gradually and manageably. but that also means the duration of the outbreak will be prolonged. \"the point of the restrictions we have is actually to stretch this out even longer. we don't want a big peak to come very quickly,\" said mark jit, a disease researcher at the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine. \"it's not like a hollywood movie with a clear ending where everyone is saved, or everyone dies, quickly.\" how does this end? most scientists believe the fight against covid-19 won't be over until there's an effective vaccine. but fauci and other experts say it will be more than a year before a vaccine can be ready for widespread use. \"the best-case scenario is that we have vaccine in 12 or 18 months and then our lives go back to normal,\" jit said. \"the worst-case scenario it takes a long time for a vaccine to be developed, and the world is really changed and our lives aren't the same again.\" while we wait, are we all shut-ins for more than a year? almost no one thinks that's realistic. \"i don't think we can maintain social distancing as it is right now for the duration of the epidemic,\" said michael levy, a university of pennsylvania disease researcher. what may be more feasible is a plan for intermittent restrictions and enhanced monitoring to control the disease, an idea explored in a new study from researchers at imperial college london. once the number of new cases falls below a certain threshold, schools, offices and restaurants could reopen. but if the number of infections spikes again, restrictions would be reinstated. \"the analogy of pumping car brakes on an icy road is what we should be thinking about,\" levy said. \"you push on the brakes to slow things down, then ease up - but if you skid, you have to pump the brakes again.\" ", "label": 1}, {"content": "commentary: never mind the scepticism - indonesia has no cases of the novel coronavirus. singapore: since the novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) outbreak was declared on dec 31, 2019, indonesia\u2019s ministry of health and the world health organization\u2019s (who) indonesia country office have been working in unison.   they have also collaborated to strengthen response measures in anticipation of the coronavirus with the first public information release on jan 8.   initial response   as the situation worsened in mid-jan before the lunar new year holiday with the lockdown of specific cities in the hubei province, indonesian minister of health terawan agus putranto announced that a budget had been allocated specifically to tackle the situation, ensuring that adequate training, logistics and standard operating procedures were provided or updated to anticipate the detection of positive cases.   the ministry had also carried out webinars since jan 24 to increase the awareness and detection of the 2019-ncov across the public sectors including health agencies, laboratories, hospitals and environment agencies within local provincial government authorities.   as part of containment efforts, the government had placed mobile containers designed to prevent containment on standby at major ports should they detect any passengers fitting the case definition and presenting with symptoms. these passengers will be transported in these containment units to pre-identified hospitals and treated appropriately.   a public information portal has been established to provide daily updates on the situation.   the public can also access information through their facebook, instagram and twitter pages with the following hashtag: #waspadaviruscorona.   the ministry of health, through the bureau of communication and community services and together with the directorate of health promotion and community empowerment, has issued many risk communication materials and posters online and via media broadcasts.   scepticism   buoyed by the confidence in his country\u2019s preparations in handling the virus, putranto declared on jan 30 that \"all (steps) have been taken to make sure that there is no outbreak (in indonesia).\u201d   according to the latest reports on feb 1, there are no detected cases in indonesia reported yet.   sentiments among indonesians and on social media, however, suggest some scepticism about these bold claims.   one reason for this disbelief is the close links between indonesia and china. the world\u2019s second-largest economy is a major investor in indonesia, which happens to be southeast asia\u2019s largest economy. in the first half of 2019, chinese investments in indonesia reached us$2.3 billion, making up for 16.2 per cent of total foreign investment in the country.      these close links also suggest a strong presence of chinese citizens in indonesia. according to statistics indonesia, from january to november 2019, chinese tourists to indonesia numbered 1.92 million, forming 12.87 per \ncent of all incoming tourists into the country.   at the time of putranto\u2019s statement, there was no restriction on chinese travelling into indonesia. the presence of many chinese tourists made his claim that there will be no outbreak in the country incredulous, since it is impossible to detect chinese tourists with latent or asymptomatic infections.   as an anticipatory measure, the ministry of health had already tightened screening at airports and ports, especially for passengers who came from china.   indonesian director-general of disease prevention and control dr anung sugihantono had earlier announced on jan 27 that the ministry of health had stepped up alertness early to check the body temperature of passengers arriving from china via plane or ship with a thermal scanner arriving through all ports.   such measures may have given authorities the confidence that there was no need to restrict travellers from china into the country.   urgent measures   however, with the who declaring the virus an international emergency last friday (jan 31), the ground has shifted beneath indonesia.   on the same day that who chief tedros adhanom ghebreyesus confirming that the global body had revised its risk assessment after crisis talks, in indonesia more than 40,000 workers at a vast chinese-controlled industrial complex in sulawesi were quarantined in anticipation to reduce the risk of exposure to the community.   that friday, indonesia also announced that it was preparing to evacuate\u00a0nationals stranded in wuhan with 238 people subsequently evacuated with four stating that they were comfortable with staying behind and three not being able to pass the screening to be fit to travel.   the evacuated passengers, along with the flight crew, have been quarantined at a military facility on\u00a0natuna besar island, near the waters where the indonesian navy had a standoff with chinese vessels only last month over a territorial incursion incident.   although, on feb 6, the authorities said they had\u00a0yet to test those quarantined in natuna for the virus as they are not showing any symptoms. the cost for carrying out tests can also be prohibitive, the health ministry noted.      on feb 2, indonesia also announced that it will temporarily stop flights to and from mainland china starting wednesday (feb 5) and bar visitors who have been in china for 14 days from entering or transiting in the country.   although there is no certainty that these efforts can stand up to the spread of an infectious disease, indonesians should take comfort that its government is not ignoring the risks of an outbreak occurring.   there is apprehension that detection may be lacking in indonesia but the capabilities and capacity in the country\u2019s health system are adequate to pick up any cases so there should be little reason to doubt their ability in this regard.   \"indonesia has a functioning early warning system and 100 hospitals in various locations that serve as referral (centres)\u00a0and can handle \ncases with proper measures as well as effective infection prevention,\u00a0who representative for indonesia, navaratnasamy paranietharan, told indonesian media last week.   keep calm   in the larger scheme of things, the response measures carried out by indonesia\u2019s health ministry thus far is in line with the escalation recommendations as outlined in who\u2019s online course for the 2019-ncov.   the who country office for indonesia had supported the government on technical issues such as risk communication materials, clinical guidelines and response measures recommendations.   moreover, based on who\u2019s report thus far, patients with the 2019-ncov infection may present a wide range of symptoms.   most seem to have mild symptoms, with only 20 per cent progressing to a severe disease, including pneumonia, respiratory failure and in some cases death.   there may be reports of asymptomatic persons being infectious and would likely fuel the spread of the disease. however, most of these cases thus far had presented only mild symptoms despite being detected with severe viral infection.   given the high human traffic volume and trade between these countries, the novel coronavirus is likely to\u00a0present itself in indonesia in the near future. but the government has taken all the necessary steps to give the country a fighting chance against the epidemic.   qing yuan pang served as an epidemiologist with the world health organization in bangladesh and had previously spent time in indonesia working on disaster monitoring and analysis for the asean coordinating centre for humanitarian affairs (aha centre)

withdrew the press credentials of american journalists at three u.s. newspapers on wednesday, intensifying a bitter fight between the world\u2019s top two economies over the spread of coronavirus and press freedoms. the move comes after beijing expelled three wall street journal correspondents - two americans and an australian - last month following an opinion column by the newspaper that called china the \u201creal sick man of asia.\u201d the day before, the united states had announced that it would begin treating five chinese state-run media entities with u.s. operations the same as foreign embassies. china denounced the newspaper\u2019s column as racist and, after the newspaper declined to apologize, revoked the visas of the three reporters in beijing. another reporter with the paper had to leave last year after china declined to renew his visa. then, in early march, washington said it was slashing the number of chinese nationals permitted to work at the u.s. offices of four major chinese state-owned media outlets to 100, from 160 previously. it cited a \u201cdeepening crackdown\u201d on independent reporting inside china. as the tit-for-tat battle escalated, beijing on wednesday announced that american journalists with press credentials expiring this year who work with the new york times, the news corp-owned wall street journal, and the washington post, would not be permitted to work in mainland china, hong kong or macau. it said they must hand back their press cards within ten days. it was not immediately clear how many journalists were affected. it also said the china branches of the three papers plus the voice of america broadcaster and time magazine must \u201cdeclare in written form information about their staff, finance, operation and real estate in china.\u201d beijing said it was retaliating against u.s. restrictions on chinese journalists. a striking aspect of beijing\u2019s response was its decision to bar the journalists from working in hong kong and macau, two semi-autonomous territories of china with their own media accreditation rules. in the past, foreign journalists kicked out of china were allowed to work in hong kong. this raised questions about hong kong\u2019s autonomy under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d agreement that still prevails between the territory and the mainland. \u201cthere\u2019s no precedent for china dictating who can and can\u2019t report from hong kong openly,\u201d said steven butler, the committee to protect journalists\u2019 asia program coordinator. \u201cit very seriously erodes hong kong\u2019s autonomy and freedom of the press.\u201d the latest development follows a war of words between washington and beijing over the outbreak of the new coronavirus that causes the sometimes fatal, highly contagious respiratory illness \ncovid-19. the virus originated in the chinese city of wuhan late last year and has so far killed 7,400 people across the world, and almost brought normal life to a standstill. u.s. secretary of state mike pompeo told reporters at a state department news conference that beijing\u2019s move on wednesday would deprive the world and the chinese people of information in \u201cincredibly challenging\u201d times brought about by the coronavirus. \u201ci regret china\u2019s decision today to further foreclose the world\u2019s ability to conduct the free press operations that frankly would be really good for the chinese people,\u201d he said. \u201cthis is unfortunate... i hope they\u2019ll reconsider.\u201d media executives denounced the move. \u201cwe unequivocally condemn any action by china to expel u.s. reporters,\u201d said washington post executive editor marty baron in a statement. \u201cthe chinese government\u2019s decision is particularly regrettable because it comes in the midst of an unprecedented global crisis, when clear and reliable information about the international response to covid-19 is essential.\u201d dean baquet, executive editor at the new york times, also condemned the decision. \u201cit is a grave mistake for china to move backwards and cut itself off from several of the world\u2019s top news organizations,\u201d he said. matt murray, editor in chief at the wall street journal and dow jones newswires, said: \u201cwe oppose government interference with a free press anywhere in the world.

customers full refunds for cancelled flights, and for those customers from countries with travel restrictions whose plans have been affected.   but many customers are still not able to get their hands on these refunds, given the high volume of calls the airlines have been getting in recent weeks amid the covid-19 outbreak that has been spreading worldwide.   put on hold for three hours   a customer of budget carrier scoot, who wants to be known only as benedict, said that his flight from tianjin, china to singapore at the start of february was cancelled abruptly, and he had to make hasty

zero'. The covid-19 epidemic brought back an expression that was frequently heard during the AIDS epidemic in the last century: \"Zero patient.\" The expression referred to the person who would have been the first to be infected by the HIV virus and transmit it to others, which in turn would have transmitted it to others, and so on. As far as the new coronavirus is concerned, there are at least two zero patients from whom we are now looking for. One is the first infected in China, which could be extremely difficult to discover, until there is no consensus on the moment when the epidemic began: the authorities say it was at the end of December, but a study published in the \"Lancet\" Beginning of this month. Another zero patient who is looking for a person who will have started the expansion of the virus to countries such as South Korea, Malaysia, Spain, France and the United Kingdom. The clues focus on a luxury hotel in Singapore. Between January 22 and 24, the hotel received an international meeting of Servomex, a British company of gas counters. ENTERS more than one hundred present included people from various parts of the world and many of them will have been carriers of the virus when they left. One of the participants was a businessman named Steve Walsh, who on the way home made a small vacation at a ski resort in the Alps, infecting eleven people who were installed on the same chal\u00eat. You have not yet been able to determine who the participant was at the meeting of Singapore that took the virus there. Incidentally, it is not even known if it was a member of the company or a hotel employee, or anyone else who was watching. Discovering this is important, not only to understand the course that the virus followed there, as to prevent us from generating new lines of infected. After all, it is quite possible that the person concerned does not even know that he is infected. A virus will suffer alterations as it transmits from animals to humans and then between them. The changes have known rhythms, which allows, using the genetic analysis, to obtain an idea of \u200b\u200bthe route followed. Based on these data, one can retreat in time and try to reach the last origin. Even before these scientific tools existed, reconstruction work was already done. the first famous case of a zero patient (who at the time was not yet so, because the expression still did not exist) will have been Mary Mallon, an Irish who emigrated to the United States in 1883. In the early years of the twentieth century, An epidemic of typhoid fever in nearby zones of New York and Manhattan alarmed the American authorities. An investigator discovered that many of the infected people came from seven houses where Mallon had worked as a cook. The investigator went to Mary and asked for blood and urine samples. Mallon refused, finding the idea a whole nonsense, because she had no symptoms of the disease. with police collaboration, \nMallon turned out to be led to a hospital, where the exams confirmed suspicions. She was one of those people who convey the disease virus, but do not present virtually symptoms. She was still hospitalized for a while, but after three years she eventually got her to free her, against the promise of not going back to work as a cook. Some time later, however, there were new outbreaks of the epidemic, and it was discovered that Mallon had returned to work as a cook in a maternity, among other places. There was no other remedy but admit it until the end of life, for she had disrespected her commitment, deliberately pushing public health. The most notorious example of a zero patient will have been the man who gave rise to the term. When the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s - or rather, of the perception and the alarm, because it would come to know that the virus was going to infect humans for a long time - a study was done on dozens of gay men in the area of \u200b\u200bLos Angeles, whom he wondered that sexual partners had had. A name began to appear frequently: Gaetan Dugas, a Canadian board host that had had a large number of different partners. The macabre of the story is that Dugas, knowing that he was seriously ill, he would have intensified his sexual contacts. In the end, he told the partners he had 'gay cancer' and that from there they would also have. The term 'patient 0' began as a misconception. In the study, Dugas was appointed not by this figure but by the letter 'O', meaning a patient from outside California later, however, it was concluded that HIV had arrived in the United States in 1969 for Via from Haiti, which in turn received him from Africa. The long work of rebuilding the course determined that the virus had passed from animals to man in Africa at the beginning of the twentieth century. That is, it had remained undetected for many decades. In a dozen different versions - transmitted by monkeys, cimpanzees and gorillas - a single would be responsible for millions of human victims. Like HIV and generality of viruses, Covid-19 also has animal origin. Currently, the more credible speculations go through snakes and bats. Reases of the latter may have transmitted it to a terrestrial animal, perhaps the Pangolim, and from there to other animals. Among these, some or some who sold themselves in the Wuhan market, had as the epicenter of the ongoing epidemic. In some previous viruses, it was possible to reach a zero patient. The Ebola epidemic that killed 11,000 people in Guinea and in other African countries between 2014 and 2016 began with a two-year-old who used to play in a hollow tree where there was a colony of bats. The SARS epidemic in 2003 originated in a 64-year-old doctor in Hong-Kong.

(reuters) - even as u.s. officials warn of an inevitable outbreak of coronavirus in the united states, and are alerting americans to take precautions, some health agencies charged with protecting the public appear unprepared to deal with the threat. barely more than a handful of public health departments across the country are able to test for the novel virus, which began in china and has spread to at least 44 countries. the federal government has less than\u00a010% of the protective masks required to protect healthcare workers and the public. and washington still does not have adequate funding in place to support health departments\u2019 efforts, though more money is on the way. conflicting messaging from the white house and top u.s. officials regarding the severity of the threat has only added to the uncertainty. the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) this week for the first time advised american businesses, schools, hospitals and families to prepare for domestic acceleration of the virus, which has infected more than 80,000 people worldwide and killed nearly 3,000. president donald trump on wednesday assured americans that the risk of coronavirus transmission in the united states was \u201cvery low.\u201d despite an explosion of cases in china over the past two months, the trump administration only this week put in a request for $2.5 billion to aid in the response, an amount both republicans and democrats have said is too small. critics of the federal response say the united states squandered precious weeks by focusing too narrowly on keeping the coronavirus from crossing u.s. borders rather than marshalling resources to prepare american communities for a widespread domestic outbreak that officials now say was inevitable. \u201cthis has been a realistic risk for a month, and the signal to trigger that kind of preparedness has only been going out in the last few days in an explicit way,\u201d said jeremy konyndyk, a senior policy fellow at the center for global development in washington. \u201cthat\u2019s a huge problem.\u201d there are 60 confirmed u.s. cases of the novel coronavirus, which causes the disease known as covid-19, u.s. health officials said on wednesday. but experts admit they have no way of knowing the true figure because access to testing at present is severely limited. so far, the u.s. strategy has focused almost exclusively on testing infected travelers, using a test that looks for genetic material from the virus in saliva or mucus. as of february 23, fewer than 500 people from 43 states had been or are being tested for the virus. currently, just seven state and local health departments have the ability to screen for the virus, the association of public health laboratories (aphl) said on wednesday. cdc-developed tests issued three weeks ago were producing inaccurate results in some labs, so new tests had to be made and cleared by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda), leaving many \nlabs with no local testing capability, the group said. the cdc and fda have worked out a fix that will allow 40 more public health labs to do testing by the end of next week, the aphl\u2019s chief executive scott becker told reuters. in the meantime, the burden has fallen largely on the cdc, which does testing for most of the country on its campus in atlanta. \u201cunfortunately, we are now in the bottom tier in countries capable of doing population-based testing,\u201d said dr. michael osterholm, director of the center for infectious disease research and policy at the university of minnesota. u.s. patients typically wait 24 to 48 hours to find out whether they have tested positive and need to be quarantined, health officials said, during which time those who are infected can spread the virus to others the cdc\u2019s test is restricted solely for use by public health labs, but if the virus begins spreading widely in the united states, hospitals will need to be able to do the tests themselves, public health experts say. such testing is typically done using kits produced by commercial companies. several privately developed tests are in the works, but none have yet won approval from the fda. some health experts also fault the narrow testing criteria that the united states is using to screen for potential infections. currently, individuals with flu-like symptoms are only tested for the coronavirus if they have traveled to a country where the virus is spreading. this has raised concerns that there are far more cases in the united states than are currently recorded. \u201cif the majority of testing is all around airports or travelers, we won\u2019t know whether it\u2019s circulating in communities,\u201d said dr. tom inglesby, director of the center for health security of the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health. those worries were reinforced on wednesday when the cdc confirmed the first u.s. case of coronavirus in a california patient with no apparent travel history. the university of california davis said in a statement the patient was transferred to the hospital with severe pneumonia and the hospital requested testing. but since the patient didn\u2019t fit the cdc\u2019s criteria, those tests were delayed by several days. on thursday, cdc said it is broadening those criteria to allow testing when the virus is suspected. around 15 state health departments contacted by reuters raised concerns about challenges they would face in the event of community spread, including worries about not having enough personal protective gear to safeguard frontline medical workers. the u.s. department of health and human services on tuesday estimated that the united states would need 300 million face masks to protect healthcare workers and the public from people infected with the virus. the country has fewer than 20 million of the kind of masks needed to protect healthcare workers in the strategic national stockpile, a government repository of medical supplies needed to address public health emergencies. \n\u201cthere is a real concern the availability of this equipment may be limited, in part because of the public buying it in a panic when they don\u2019t need it,\u201d said matt zavadsky, head of the national association of emergency medical technicians. president donald trump\u2019s administration is considering invoking special powers through a law called the defense production act to quickly expand domestic manufacturing of protective masks and clothing to combat the coronavirus in the united states, two u.s. officials told reuters. with no covid-19 vaccine or proven anti-viral medicine available, states are planning to isolate sick people in their homes, both to slow community spread and reduce pressure on hospitals, according to the cdc. their ability to track a rapidly expanding web of patients who test positive, and all the people with whom they have had contact, is of major concern, according to chief epidemiologists in several states. health departments in some states have purchased disease surveillance software to help them with that task. the state of washington\u2019s system, for instance, tracks patients and people they have had contact with, and asks them about their condition. if someone reports symptoms that merit hospitalization, the patient and doctors are informed of that. the cdc said in a news conference on tuesday that transmission of the virus could be slowed by the closure of schools and businesses and the cancellations of concerts and other mass gatherings. but exactly who would make those decisions or how they would be enforced isn\u2019t clear and could vary widely throughout the nation. in texas, for example, such decisions may be made by local officials, said chris van deus, a spokesman with the texas health department. \u201ctexas is a home rule state so the buck really stops with county judges and mayors,\u201d van deus said. another concern is a flood of patients into health systems that are already overburdened in many parts of the country, particularly during winter flu season. washington state is considering temporary drive-through care facilities to stop potential coronavirus carriers entering healthcare facilities, mindful that hospitals can amplify outbreaks, as was\u00a0the case with the viruses that cause mers and sars. new mexico is working with healthcare systems to turn outpatient facilities into care units if needed, said state epidemiologist michael landen. \u201cthe biggest challenge is getting a consistent message to the public with respect to their options with dealing with this virus,\u201d landen said.

No country was so difficult to affect China from the spread of the novel coronavirus like South Korea. There were more than 7,700 cases with State of Tuesday. But apparently one got the spread under control: Meanwhile, there are significantly less new infections than ten days ago. Also Taiwan, the land, from which because of its close economic interdependence with China thought many, it would hit particularly hard from the spread, has the problem under control. In Japan, which also cultivates close economic relations with the People's Republic, one was recently a total of 1,200 infected - with more than 126 million inhabitants. All three states are unlike the VR China, where the virus broke out, democracies. And the city state Singapore, which is a largely free country despite some strong authoritarian trains, praised the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) personally, because contact persons would be particularly efficiently tracked there. What can Europe learn from these countries with its steadily rising numbers of new infections? Our Asia correspondents report. In South Korea, Wednesday started with an epidemiological nightmare. Ironically, in the Metropolis Seoul, where ten million people live, 90 people stuck with the novel Coronavirus around a call center. Nearby: A commuter station that connects the suburbs with the center. Nationwide, the health authorities reported 242 new infections on this day. Despite the increase, the East Asian State has shown considerable success in virus control: more than 900 people had been infected on March 1, there were only 131 new infections on Tuesday. South Korea has conceivably unfavorable conditions to deal with such an epidemic: on the one hand, the geographic and economic proximity to China, which had favored imported cases especially at the beginning of the virus outbreak. On the other hand, South Korea is away from the city states of one of the world's most densely populated countries in the world, in Seoul, the population density is four times as high as in Berlin. More than two-thirds of all cases in South Korea go back to a single infection strand. When it came out in February that a woman who is a member of a sect, the virus carries in itself, almost all of the more than 10,000 members of the Shincheonji sect in the city of Daegu were tested. Result: Good 4,000 people wore the virus in themselves. This is more than half of the over 7,700 coronavirus cases across the country. Nevertheless, South Korea has managed to reverse the rapid eruption without a variety of quarantines and without an entry bans from abroad. Only visitors from the South China province of Hubei must go to quarantine for 14 days. Hardly any country in the world has systematically tested its population on the coronavirus. \nWith State of 10 March, more than 220,000 South Koreans were tested for a 50 million population on the pathogen. For comparison: The US have only carried out almost 10,000 tests - with a more than six times as large as South Korea. \"If you look at these two numbers, it reflects what a good and what makes a bad answer to the virus,\" commented on the US epidemiologist Larry Brilliant in a BBC interview. According to the Ministry of Health in Seoul, the tests for the population are free. And comfortable: As the first country, South Korea has introduced so-called drive-through test stations to busy streets. In provisional tent planes, physicians perform a test in less than ten minutes. The driver does not even have to leave his car. More than 50 such Drive Throughs are in operation nationwide. The sale of facial masks in pharmacies is limited per person to two. The export of masks abroad has long been forbidden. In addition, South Korea sets in the fight against the virus on radical transparency, which would not be compatible with privacy and privacy in Germany: In cooperation with telecommunications providers, the authorities send residents of risk regions Warn-SMS to their cell phones, also nationwide the movement sequences of the infected to ins Detail published. Fabian Kretschmer, Beijing in Taiwan is the world almost okay - at least in Covid-19 things. Only 49 people have become infected - a person has died. Overall, this is a remarkable balance for a country with 23 million inhabitants, which is right in front of China's coast. Not even a big dark figure is to be feared in the face of the well-developed health system. Of course, the concern in front of the virus has also reached the island state. Restaurants are not quite so full, more people wear mouthguards and events. But on the whole, everyday life continues normally. This has to do with bad experiences from the past and with a currently good preparation. After 73 SARS dead, the 2003 government designed an efficient system against epidemics that responded early. From 31 December 2019, according to first reports on suspicious diseases, officials already controlled passengers from the Chinese city of Wuhan before leaving the aircraft. And three days before China wuhan on January 23, Taiwan already activated his crisis center. One day later, the export of protective masks was prohibited, on 6 February the entry of all Chinese citizens stopped - no matter where. It has succeeded in successfully understanding infection chains almost completely and to put contact persons under home compasses. This also applies to persons who were in high-risk areas. At the end of February, 30,000 people were in self-isolation or they had behind them. daily \nVisits and calls make sure that no one leaves his apartment for 14 days. Draconian punishments are also accepted in the democratic state of Taiwan. A returned from China, instead of staying at home, cross and across the country, was sentenced to the maximum penalty of 30,000 euros at the beginning of March. 15,000 people are already tested, the capacities are sufficient for more than 3,000 tests daily. This in combination with transparent communication has increased the popularity of the government. It is also helpful that the Vice-President is a well-known epidemiologist who had already stated the fight against SARS as the Minister of Health. Support by the World Health Organization, Taiwan barely learns - The island state may not even be a member of the WHO on printing China. The People's Republic looks at Taiwan as part of her territory, so it is excluded from all UN organizations. Participation in expert meetings and access to databases Taiwan's epidemics are denied. China remains tough, even though Europeans, Americans and Japanese plead behind the scenes for Taiwan's involvement in the WHO network. When researchers from Taiwan's National Science Academy reported a few days ago that their newly developed rapid test SARS-COV-2 could prove within 15 minutes, it did not take long until Chinese Staatsmedien took the success of their country. Until verified is that the new method is reliable, it will probably take months. That Taiwan contributes to the fight against the virus is not denial. Klaus Bardenhagen, Taipei in Singapore threatens Mr. H. Six months imprisonment or a punishment of several thousand euros. The 38-year-old recently survived Covid-19-disease. But after recovery, the authorities reported him. They throw him and his wife to have violated the infectious diseases law. The alleged offense of the two: they should have done false information where they had stopped in the days before the diagnosis. About the ad against the two informed Singapore Ministry of Health of Journalists by a press release, also called the full names of the accused and directed a warning to the public: Anyone who lies with surveys by the epidemics, commits a serious offense. For strict behavioral rules and a penible surveillance, the city state is known - now this approach also provides the direction in curbing the new coronavirus. So far, the authorities have success: researchers of Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston assume in a new study that Singapore succeeds three times better to uncover infection cases than in the global average. In the center of Singapore strategy is the so-called contact tracing, ie the search search for contact persons of Covid-19 patients.

If someone can not remember exactly where he was with whom, the police are used for further investigative work. The officials then also evaluate surveillance cameras to find out which taxi driver was traveling with an infected person. The authorities were thus able to attribute all local infectances to six clusters and brake the spread. And clear: Who had close contact with a Covid 19 patient, must be in quarantine in Singapore. Infringements of quarantine requirements can also have serious consequences: a 45-year-old foreigner who had a permanent residence permit in Singapore, has been declared in the city state to the unwanted person. He had not held on the edition after a China visit to stay in his apartment for 14 days. The man now loses his home. \"Some think that's too strict,\" Interior Minister Kasiviswanathan Shanmugam wrote on Facebook. \"During this time, it is necessary that everyone cooperates.\" Resistance in the population against the harsh course of the government has not yet been noticeable. From health experts, there is praise: the boss of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, recommended to take a look at something from the city state: \"I'm really impressed by Singapors strive to find any case, to follow contacts and stop the transfer.\" Mathias Peer, Bangkok As in Japan Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe ended at the end of February before the press, he had a request: All schools in the country should close for two weeks. Events canceled with large human collections or at least laid to avoid infections. Previously, the Japanese Ministry of Economic Affairs had advised the companies in the country to work their workforce from the HomeOffice. And the citizens like the daily Rushhour avoid, as well as shopping centers and other places typical for collections. This consistent line of official site was introduced when 900 infections were counted in Japan. Included were the approximately 700 people on the cruise ship Diamond Princess. Just because of this ship, the government was severely criticized. After the first infection case on board had become known early February, appropriate quarantine arrangements remained more vague for more than two weeks. On board there were no clear commandments for changing protective clothing, crew members were sometimes fraudulent than passengers and infected themselves in this way. Finally, when the Diamond Princess was gradually evacuated, passengers were initially sent home without symptoms even in public transport. The outcry was great. Japan's government is again as careless as in 2011, \nWhen the land experienced the atomous Gau of Fukushima, it was said. Since then, Premier Abe has been particularly present. As about the North Island Hokkaido at the end of February imposed a regional state of emergency with DE-factto-start barriers, ABE had already begun to prepare all Japan on such a step. Last Tuesday, his government finally initiated the change of a law, which will also be applicable to Covid-19 cases. At the end of this week, it will probably happen both parliamentary chambers. Then ABE school closures and event statements can no longer only recommend, but instruct. In order not only to avoid domestic transport, but also the recent import of the virus, Japan also does not allow entry for people from South Korea, Iran or Northern Italy. How effective the whole thing is, is difficult to say now. The growth rate of total infections does not seem to be exponentially, but rather linear. Most recently, Japan has around 1,200 corona cases counted on the Diamond Princess - at 126 million inhabitants. In addition, doctors have reported that various precautions at the moment fewer ordinary flufectifications are usually recorded. However, infectiologists also assume that the true number of Covid-19 diseases in Japan is even higher than the official, since older people are over-represented in the country.

It is a founding and board member of the European Council on Foreign Relations and Member of the Board of Trustees of the International Crisis Group. KraTev released a series of influential books and essays and regularly writes for the \"New York Times\". \"We live in strange times,\" a Spanish friend wrote recently - and they are really strange. We do not know when the Covid-19 pandemic will be over; We do not know how to finish it; And we can only speculate about the long-term political and economic consequences. In times of crisis, we are infected with uncertainty. Nevertheless, seven things can be said about this crisis that distinguish them from previous crises. Unlike the financial crisis 2008/2009, the Coronavirus will force a return of the Big Government. Having collapsed Lehman Brothers collapsed, many observers thought that the crisis-related mistrust would lead to more confidence in governments in the market. This was a well-known concept: According to the great depression, the citizens of 1929 decidedly government interventions to balance the losses of the markets. In the seventies it was the other way around: Citizens were disappointed with state interventions and began to believe in the market again. The paradox of the years 2008/2009 is that the mistrust compared to the market did not lead to the demand for more state intervention. The coronavirus will bring back to the state all the line. The citizens rely on governments that they organize the collective defense of the pandemic and that they rescue the economy. The efficiency of a government will now be seen whether it is able to change the everyday behavior of people. The coronavirus once again brings the nimbus of the borders to the light and will help strengthen the role of nations within the European Union. This can now be observed at the closure of the boundaries between the countries - and that every government is now focused on their own citizens. Under normal circumstances, EU Member States would not distinguish patients in their health systems to nationality. But in this crisis, it is likely that they prefer their own citizens towards others (here is not an immigrant from non-EU countries, but Europeans with an EU passport). The coronavirus will thus strengthen nationalism, if not the ethnic nationalism. To survive, the state becomes of the \nCitizens desire to build walls - not only between the countries, but also between individuals, because the risk of infection comes from the people who are most common. It is not the stranger, but it's the next ones who are the biggest risk. This is about trust in expertise. The financial crisis and the refugee crisis have led to great public dissatisfaction with the experts. This development, which was an important factor in the success of the populist politicians over the past ten years, will be reflected by the Coronavirus. Verythe people are very open to putting their trust in experts and follow science when their own life is at stake. This can already be observed how much the professionals who lead the fight against the virus gain legitimacy. Professionalism is back in fashion. This point is not quite mature yet, but still very important. Regratably, the coronavirus could increase the attractiveness of Big Data based autoritarism, as the Chinese government maintains him. You can safely accuse the Chinese leadership a lack of transparency or that it has responded late to the spread of the virus. But the efficiency of their answer and the ability of the Chinese state to control the movements and behaviors of his population are impressive. In the current crisis, citizens constantly compare the ability to act and efficiency of their government with other governments. It should not surprise us if in the end of China as a winner fabric - and the US as a loser. This is about crisis management. The governments have learned through the economic crisis, the refugee crisis and terrorist attacks that panic is their greatest enemy. If the people after a terrorist attack changed their everyday behavior and did not leave the house for months, then that would have helped the terrorists to achieve their goals. This was also reflected in 2008/2009: Behavioral changes have increased the price payable in the crisis. Therefore, the slogans of politicians and politicians like the citizens were: remains quiet, continues with your life, ignores the risk and does not exaggerate. Now, however, governments need to call up their populations to change their behavior by staying at home. The success of governments depends very crucially on whether they succeed in making the people sufficiently that they do that too. No panic, that would be the wrong answer to the Covid 19 crisis. To slow down the pandemic, people should be scared - and radically change their lifestyle. The COVID 19 crisis will have a significant impact on the dynamics of relationships between the generations. in connection with the debates on climate change and its dangers have \nThe younger generations accused the older ones, to be selfish and not seriously ensure the future. Also this momentum returns the coronavirus: now the older members of society are much more vulnerable and feel threatened by the obvious invalidation of millenials to change their lifestyle. This generation conflict could increase if this crisis should last long. It will come to the moment the governments will be forced to decide: either they damm the pandemic, which leads to the destruction of the economy, or they take a higher human price to save the economy. It is still very early to speculate about the political consequences of Covid-19. The crisis seems to legitimize the fears of globalization opponents: closed airports and people in self-isolation - that could be the Ground Zero of Globalization. But paradoxically, a new anti-globalization movement could also weaken the populist actors who may have right, but no solution. The COVID 19 crisis will definitely change thoroughly as the EU responds to other crises that it has experienced over the past ten years. Budget discipline is not even more in Berlin the economic mantra. And there is currently no more European government, which uses the opening of the boundaries for refugees. How exactly the crisis will affect the European project, we will see. But already it is clear that the coronavirus will ask some basic assumptions on which the EU builds up.

and if you are in india, cows - roam free while their owners are captives to disease, dislocations and fear.   from japan to italy, britain and the united states, the developed world is a sea of confusion, while some days it looks as though it is the developing world that is doing a better job at keeping a clear head.   new york governor andrew cuomo painted the best description of what is going on. at a press conference televised live by cnn on tuesday night in asia, he likened the situation to the snow globes you had as a child: touch one part of it and the whole image fuzzes over.   not a continent has been unaffected. as of yesterday, the disease has sickened more than 281,000 and killed nearly 11,500. frighteningly, the numbers have begun rising in africa, itself just emerging from a long battle with ebola.   history's wheels move in circles.   in the past quarter-century, the world was first forced to take notice of a contagion emanating from asia with the onset of the asian financial crisis, often called the east asian flu.   just as now, its origin lay in china, when it devalued its currency sharply in 1994, cutting the competitiveness of exports from japan to thailand.   like a boxer rocked on his feet, the rest of east asia staggered around for a couple of years. speculators began attacking asian assets. by july 1997, the thai baht collapsed and in no time, the asian flu had swept through the region, toppling the indonesian regime and devastating the thai, south korean, malaysian and indonesian economies.   then in 2002, the severe acute respiratory syndrome, or sars, began to afflict people in guangdong. thought to be an animal virus, it was identified in 2003. this time it was not a metaphorical flu and was deadly while it lasted.   then came another respiratory illness new to humans. this time, it originated in west asia. middle east respiratory syndrome was first reported in saudi arabia in 2012 and has since spread to several other countries, including the us.   in some respects, covid-19, as we have come to know the coronavirus currently tormenting us, is all of the above and possibly far more durable.   at its \nsource, it has crushed the chinese economy. the world's no. 2 had already been slowing, weighed down by a debt to gross domestic product ratio that crossed a staggering 300 per cent last year, according to the institute of international finance. today, new bond defaults in china are reportedly topping us$1 billion (s$1.4 billion). little surprise, too, that the country has not published data on business closures for the past six months.   in the us, the biggest economy, the us$1.2 trillion market for loans to junk-rated firms, which survived the 2008 housing-led financial crisis, is under severe strain. wider afield, 12 years of cheap and easy money policies have built a us$10 trillion debt mountain. a hefty shove, which would be the equivalent of the virus crisis persisting for another six months, could topple the edifice.   instructively, the us$1 trillion rescue plan unveiled by the trump administration on wednesday could not prevent economic panic from accelerating.   several smaller but significant economies are in worse shape.   india was facing a consumption demand and banking crisis even before the virus hit home. now, the indian government, terrified of the enormity of the challenge, has stopped its own nationals abroad from coming home despite its strident nationalism.   it has good reason to do so; the country has less than one hospital bed for every thousand people, a third of the global average.   in south-east asia, speculators are eyeing thailand, the region's no. 2 economy, as the one most vulnerable, now that its last engine - tourism - has stopped firing. indonesia' currency has suffered some of the steepest falls. talk about a sense of deja vu.   what's worrying is that we still do not know enough about this virus. in january, china's top epidemiologist, who won fame for identifying the sars virus in 2003, had said that covid-19 would not be as harmful as sars and would be controlled sooner. neither prediction has proved accurate.   millennials in london and new york, confident they will live forever and cheered by early reports that the very young and the old are most vulnerable, had partied ceaselessly. now, it appears that the medical evidence does not support the theory that the young are that invincible: in italy, almost a quarter of the patients are aged between 19 and 50.   britain, which had set out on a path of building \"herd immunity\" by not standing in the way of large-scale exposure to the virus, reversed course after seeing calamitous projection from imperial college london and after the world heath organisation (who) pointed out that while it took three months for the number of coronavirus cases to reach 100,000, it took a mere 12 days for the next 100,000.   an indonesian police officer spraying disinfectant at a local school in palu, central sulawesi, on friday, amid the coronavirus outbreak. indonesia's currency has suffered some of the steepest falls in the wake of the pandemic. history's wheels move in \ncircles, and this is a case of deja vu, says the writer, recalling the asian financial crisis of the past quarter-century which swept through the region and eventually toppled the indonesian regime. photo: agence france-presse   china claims to have licked the disease and that the new cases it is seeing mostly originated abroad, but oddly, many of its workers and students aren't back in factories and colleges. could a vast nation that has more than 60 cities with populations of more than a million be so certain that it has stopped all domestically originated cases of the disease?   as dr bruce aylward, senior adviser to the director-general of who, said in a recent time magazine interview: \"never, never underestimate a new disease, there's just too much unknown.\"   what happens when the chips are done falling? the world that will emerge is probably going to look a lot different - industrially, commercially, politically and socially.   start with global institutions. there will be close scrutiny of the role played by who in combating the crisis. questions will be raised about whether its role as a scientific body got mixed up with its responsibilities as a diplomatic institution under the charter of the united nations, causing it to be ultra-careful about not getting on the wrong side of the chinese government.   for instance, did it really have to wait so long to declare a disease outbreak a pandemic?   what about the international monetary fund (imf)? on feb 19, it released a surveillance note that maintained its january projection that global growth will accelerate to 3.3 per cent this year from 2.9 per cent last year.   a month later, that assessment looks plain silly.   supply chains will be upended. even if china sends its factory workers back to work, many companies are facing massive supply disruptions - from the us and from south-east asia. who will they supply finished goods to when global demand has collapsed?   it is rare to see both supply and demand cratering simultaneously, as they are now.   what about china, where the disease originated and whose first instinct was to prevent the news from leaking rather than warn the world of the danger?   global diplomacy will probably go through a severe reassessment, too. whatever embers of good feeling that existed between the us and china have disappeared in the wake of the \"china virus\", as president donald trump insists on calling it, fuelling chinese fury.   european solidarity has been exposed as a fig leaf as each country rushed to protect its own, starting with germany, the european union's biggest economy. it is china that is coming to the aid of countries such as italy and estonia as they fight covid-19.   at the same time, some analysts are linking the virus outbreak in italy and in the iranian city of qom to both countries being enthusiastic participants in china's belt and road initiative.   there is major concern in europe that its industry will not be able to withstand another \nbout of state-subsidised chinese exports that will inevitably follow once there is a measure of check on the disease.   meanwhile, respected china specialists such as mr daniel rosen of the centre for strategic and international studies suggest that beijing's inclination to massage the numbers hasn't abated despite its mishandling of the virus emanating from wuhan. senior officials are compelling juniors to go into offices over the weekend and keep the air-conditioners running in order to show higher power consumption, a key indicator of economic activity.   without question, just as in an earlier era when the success of the east asian tiger economies spawned literature on the superiority of \"asian\" governance models, there already is plenty of discussion on whether authoritarian models such as the chinese example are more of a help than a hindrance in crises than \"messy\" democracies.   the italians, some will likely point out, have had more than 60 governments since world war ii. china, which showed remarkable ability to control the outbreak, has had one.   economic shibboleths have already been rewritten; after the asian financial flu, the imf second-guessed many of the policies it had applied for decades, particularly its advice to tighten interest rates in order to protect free-falling currencies. it is not unreasonable to believe that political systems could be put under a similar lens.   to be sure, there's been stuff to cheer about amid the gloom. dolphins and swans have reportedly reappeared in venetian canals.   big fat indian weddings are being toned down, even as the air in the nation's capital has never felt cleaner. in countless homes, cupboards unattended for years are getting a cleaning and teenagers are talking to their parents.   the world has suffered -

The number of deaths rose by another three to nine, as China's State Council reported on Wednesday. By evening, 473 were demonstrably recognized with the coronavirus sufferers. Even outside of China, more infections were known. For the first time, a case was reported in the USA. There is no evidence in Europe. According to the Federal Government, the spread of the new lung disease means only a \"very low\" health risk for the people in Germany.

Especially at the approximately 4200 kilometer border with China, entering with temperature measurements should be checked and additionally questioned. It is believed that the new coronavirus comes from a fish market in the Central Chinese 11-million-metropolis Wuhan, where wildlife were sold. At the present time, the source was that the source had been a wild animal in the market, Gao Fu said director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control. Accordingly, there were first transfers from the animal to humans before the virus adapted to his new host and came to transfers between people.

At the largest annual travel wave of the country, a few hundred million Chinese are on the way. Health experts fear that particularly infectious \nPatients who could scatter the virus faster. So-called super-widespread (SuperSpreader) had also given the SARS pandemic from China, which also fell victim to around 800 people in 2002/2003. The new virus belongs to the same virus species, it is only another one - according to the current state more harmless - variant. Especially because of the memories of the SARS outbreak, the new illness in people in China has become the omnipresent topic. The country had come to a standstill at that time, schools remained closed over weeks. SARS viruses are among the coronaviruses, which often cause harmless diseases such as colds. However, there are also pathogens of dangerous respiratory diseases such as Mers. In Beijing, many people with protective masks are now unusual. In some shops they were already sold out. Families discussed whether scheduled trips should be canceled over the holidays. Experts are convinced that travelers will bring the new lung disease at least occasionally to Europe. The World Health Organization (WHO) had convened its emergency committee because of lung disease. The experts advised on Wednesday. The EU Commission also planned a meeting to assess the risks through the new lung disease. The WHO can call an international health nesting and thus recommend sharper measures to combat the disease. When the SARS virus appeared in China more than 17 years ago, the WHO recommended measures such as fever measurements at airports of the affected region. This may potentially recognize and held away from travel. Airports in other countries such as Singapore installed for incoming passengers goals with thermal imaging cameras. So they wanted to filter out feverish passengers. At that time, the WHO procedure has not yet existed to explain a \"Public Health Emergencies of International Concern, Pheic). Even after the outbreak of the swine flu 2009, the WHO recommended such measurements. Researchers at the University of Perth in Australia came to a study in 2015 concludes that the measures were not effective. In Singapore, 2009 of 116 pork infected infected only 15 at the airport were discovered, in Japan only 10 out of 151 travelers were noticed, which later had this flu shape. Travelers can therefore be infected and infected others before they develop symptoms like fever. Also from the Robert Koch Institut (RKI) in Berlin it was said, there was no scientific evidence for the effectiveness of so-called entry screenings at airports, ie controls when entering. Useful, exit screenings are particularly affected by a disease wave. Wuhan has already introduced corresponding controls upon departure.

diamond princess, the coronavirus more often infects clusters of family members, friends and work colleagues, said dr david l. heymann, who chairs an expert panel advising the world health organisation on emergencies.   no one is certain why the virus travels in this way, but experts see an opening nonetheless.   \"you can contain clusters,\" dr heymann said. \"you need to identify and stop discrete outbreaks, and then do rigorous contact tracing.\"   but doing so takes intelligent, rapidly adaptive work by health officials, and near-total cooperation from the populace. containment becomes realistic only when americans realise that working together is the only way to protect themselves and their loved ones.   in interviews with a dozen of the world's leading experts on fighting epidemics, there was wide agreement on the steps that must be taken immediately.   those experts included international public health officials who have fought aids, malaria, tuberculosis, flu and ebola; scientists and epidemiologists; and former health officials who led major american global health programmes in both republican and democratic administrations.   americans must be persuaded to stay home, they said, and a system put in place to isolate the infected and care for them outside the home. travel restrictions should be extended,\u00a0productions of masks and ventilators must be accelerated, and testing problems must be resolved.   but tactics like forced isolation, school closings and pervasive gps tracking of patients brought more divided reactions.   it was not at all clear that a nation so fundamentally committed to individual liberty and distrustful of government could learn to adapt to many of these measures, especially those that smack of state compulsion.   \"the american way is to look for better outcomes through a voluntary system,\" said dr luciana borio, who was director of medical and biodefence preparedness for the national security council before her unit was disbanded in 2018. \"i think you can appeal to people to do the right thing.\"   in the week since the interviews began, remarkable changes have come over american life. state governments are telling residents they must stay home. non-essential businesses are \nbeing shuttered. the streets are quieter than they have been in generations, and even friends keep a wary distance. what seemed unthinkable just a week ago is rapidly becoming the new normal.   what follows are the recommendations offered by the experts interviewed by the new york times.   the white house holds frequent media briefings to describe the administration's progress against the pandemic, often led by president donald trump or vice-president mike pence, flanked by a rotating cast of officials.   many experts, some of whom are international civil servants, declined to speak on the record for fear of offending the president. but they were united in the opinion that politicians must step aside and let scientists both lead the effort to contain the virus and explain to americans what must be done.   just as generals take the lead in giving daily briefings in wartime - as general norman schwarzkopf did during the persian gulf war - medical experts should be at the microphone now to explain complex ideas like epidemic curves, social distancing and off-label use of drugs.   the microphone should not even be at the white house, scientists said, so that briefings of historic importance do not dissolve into angry, politically charged exchanges with the press corps, as happened again last friday.   instead, leaders must describe the looming crisis and the possible solutions in ways that will win the trust of americans.   above all, the experts said, briefings should focus on saving lives and making sure that average wage earners survive the coming hard times - not on the stock market, the tourism industry or the president's health. there is no time left to point fingers and assign blame.   \"at this point in the emergency, there's little merit in spending time on what we should have done or who's at fault,\" said admiral tim ziemer, who was the coordinator of the president's malaria initiative from 2006 until early 2017 and led the pandemic response unit on the national security council before its disbanding.   \"we need to focus on the enemy, and that's the virus.\"   the next priority, experts said, is extreme social distancing.   if it were possible to wave a magic wand and make all americans freeze in place for 14 days while sitting six\u00a0feet (1.8m) apart, epidemiologists say, the whole epidemic would sputter to a halt.   the virus would die out on every contaminated surface and, because almost everyone shows symptoms within two weeks, it would be evident who was infected. if we had enough tests for every american, even the completely asymptomatic cases could be found and isolated. the crisis would be over.   obviously, there is no magic wand, and no 300 million tests. but the goal of lockdowns and social distancing is to approximate such a total freeze. to attempt that, experts said, travel and human interaction must be reduced to a minimum.   italy moved incrementally: officials slowly and reluctantly closed restaurants, churches and museums, and \nbanned weddings and funerals. nonetheless, the country's death count continues to rise.   the us is slowly following suit. international flights are all but banned, but not domestic ones. california has ordered all residents to stay at home; new york is to shutter all non-essential businesses on sunday evening.   but other states have fewer restrictions, and in florida, spring break revellers ignored government requests to clear the beaches for days.   last\u00a0friday, dr anthony fauci, chief medical adviser to the white house coronavirus task force, said he advocated restrictive measures all across the country.   in contrast to the halting steps taken here, china shut down wuhan - the epicentre of the nation's outbreak - and restricted movement in much of the country on jan 23, when the country had a mere 500 cases and 17 deaths.   its rapid action had an important effect: with the virus mostly isolated in one province, the rest of china was able to save wuhan. even as many cities fought their own smaller outbreaks, they sent 40,000 medical workers into wuhan, roughly doubling its medical force.   in a vast, largely closed society, it can be difficult to know what is happening on the ground, and there is no guarantee that the virus won't roar back as the chinese economy restarts.   but the lesson is that relatively unaffected regions of the us will be needed to help rescue overwhelmed cities like new york and seattle. keeping these areas at least somewhat free of the coronavirus means enacting strict measures, and quickly.   within cities, there are dangerous hot spots: one restaurant, one gym, one hospital, even one taxi may be more contaminated than many identical others nearby because someone had a coughing fit inside.   each day's delay in stopping human contact, experts said, creates more hot spots, none of which can be identified until about a week later, when the people infected there start falling ill.   to stop the explosion, municipal activity must be curtailed. still, some americans must stay on the job: doctors, nurses, ambulance drivers; police officers and firefighters; the technicians who maintain the electrical grid and gas and phone lines.   the delivery of food and medicine must continue, so that people pinned in their homes suffer nothing worse than boredom. those essential workers may eventually need permits, and a process for issuing them, if police are needed to enforce stay-at-home orders, as they have been in china and italy.   people in lockdown adapt. in wuhan, apartment complexes submit group orders for food, medicine, diapers and other essentials. shipments are assembled at grocery warehouses or government pantries and dropped off. in italy, trapped neighbours serenade one another.   it's an intimidating picture. but the weaker the freeze, the more people die in overburdened hospitals - and the longer it ultimately takes for the economy to restart.   south korea avoided locking down any city, but only by moving early and \nwith extraordinary speed. in january, the country had four companies making tests, and as of march 9 had tested 210,000 citizens - the equivalent of testing 2.3 million americans.   as of the same date, fewer than 9,000 americans had been tested.   everyone who is infected in south korea goes into isolation in government shelters, and phones and credit card data are used to trace their prior movements and find their contacts. where they walked before they fell ill is broadcast to the cellphones of everyone who was nearby.   anyone even potentially exposed is quarantined at home; a gps app tells the police if that person goes outside. the fine for doing so is us$8,000 (s$11,600).   british researchers are trying to develop a similar tracking app, albeit one more palatable to citizens in western democracies.   testing must be done in a coordinated and safe way, experts said. the seriously ill must go first, and the testers must be protected.   in china, those seeking a test must describe their symptoms on a telemedicine website. if a nurse decides a test is warranted, they are directed to one of dozens of \"fever clinics\" set up far from all other patients.   personnel in head-to-toe gear check their fevers and question them. then, ideally, patients are given a rapid flu test and a white blood cell count is taken to rule out influenza and bacterial pneumonia.   then their lungs are visualised in a ct scanner to look for \"ground-glass opacities\" that indicate pneumonia and rule out cancer and tuberculosis. only then are they given a diagnostic test for the coronavirus - and they are told to wait at the testing centre.   the results take a minimum of four hours; in the past, if results took overnight, patients were moved to a hotel to wait - sometimes for two to three days, if doctors believed retesting was warranted. it can take several days after an exposure for a test to turn positive.   in the us, people seeking tests are calling their doctors, who may not have them, or sometimes waiting in traffic jams leading to store parking spaces. last\u00a0friday, new york city limited testing only to those patients requiring hospitalisation, saying the system was being overwhelmed.   as soon as possible, experts said, the us must develop an alternative to the practice of isolating infected people at home, as it endangers families. in china, 75 to 80 per cent of all transmission occurred in family clusters.   that pattern has already repeated itself here. seven members of a large family in new jersey were infected; four have already died. after a lawyer in new rochelle, new york, fell ill, his wife, son and daughter all tested positive.   instead of a policy that advises the infected to remain at home, as the centres for disease control and prevention now does, experts said cities should establish facilities where the mildly and moderately ill can recuperate under the care and observation of nurses.   wuhan created many such centres, called \"temporary hospitals\", \neach a cross between a dormitory and a first-aid clinic. they had cots and oxygen tanks, but not the advanced machines used in intensive care units.   us cities now have many spaces that could serve as isolation wards. already, new york is considering turning the jacob k. javits convention centre into a temporary hospital, along with the westchester convention centre and two university campuses.   governor\u00a0ron desantis of florida said last saturday that state officials were also considering opening isolation wards.   in china, said dr bruce aylward, leader of the world health organisation's observer team there, people originally resisted leaving home or seeing their children go into isolation centres with no visiting rights - just as americans no doubt would. in china, they came to accept it.   \"they realised they were keeping their families safe,\" he said. \"also, isolation is really lonely. it's psychologically difficult. here, they were all together with other people in the same boat. they supported each other.\"   because china, taiwan and vietnam were hit by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) in 2003, and south korea has grappled with middle east respiratory syndrome (mers), fever checks during disease outbreaks became routine.   in most cities in affected asian countries, it is commonplace before entering any bus, train or subway station, office building, theatre or even a restaurant to get a temperature check. washing your hands in chlorinated water is often also required.   \"they give you a sticker afterward,\" said dr heymann, who recently spent a week teaching in singapore. \"i built up quite a collection.\"   in china, having a fever means a mandatory trip to a fever clinic to check for coronavirus. in the wuhan area, different cities took different approaches.   cellphone videos from china show police officers knocking on doors and taking temperatures. in some, people who resist are dragged away by force. the city of ningbo offered bounties of us$1,400 to anyone who turned in a coronavirus sufferer.   the city of qianjiang, by contrast, offered the same amount of money to any resident who came in voluntarily and tested positive.   some measures made western experts queasy. it is difficult to imagine americans permitting a family member with a fever to be dragged to an isolation ward where visitors are not permitted.   \"a lot of people's rights were violated,\" dr borio said.   voluntary approaches, like explaining to patients that they will be keeping family and friends safe, are more likely to work in the west, she added.   finding and testing all the contacts of every positive case is essential, experts said. at the peak of its epidemic, wuhan had 18,000 people tracking down individuals who had come in contact with the infected.   at the moment, the health departments of some american counties lack the manpower to trace even syphilis or tuberculosis, let alone scores of casual contacts of someone infected with the coronavirus. \ndr borio suggested that young americans could use their social networks to \"do their own contact tracing\". social media is also used in asia, but in different ways.   china's strategy is quite intrusive: to use the subway in some cities, citizens must download an app that rates how great a health risk they are. south korean apps tell users exactly where infected people have travelled.   when he lectured at a singapore university, dr heymann said, dozens of students were in the room. but just before he began class, they were photographed to record where everyone sat.   \"that way, if someone turns up infected later, you can find out who sat near them,\" dr heymann said. \"that's really clever.\"   contacts generally must remain home for 14 days and report their temperatures twice a day.   american experts have divided opinions about masks, but those who have worked in asia see their value.   there is very little data showing that flat surgical masks protect healthy individuals from disease. nonetheless, asian countries generally make it mandatory that people wear them. in china, the police even used drones to chase individuals down streets, ordering them to go home and mask up.   the asian approach is less about data than it is about crowd psychology, experts explained.   all experts agree that the sick must wear masks to keep in their coughs. but if a mask indicates that the wearer is sick, many people will be reluctant to wear one. if everyone is required to wear masks, the sick automatically have one on and there is no stigma attached.   also, experts emphasised, americans should be taught to take seriously admonitions to stop shaking hands and hugging. the \"who elbow bump\" may look funny, but it's a legitimate technique for preventing infection.   \"in asia, where they went through sars, people understand the danger,\" dr heymann said. \"it's instilled in the population that you've got\u00a0to do the right thing.\"   federal intervention is necessary for some vital aspects of life during a pandemic. only the federal government can enforce interstate commerce laws to ensure that food, water, electricity, gas, phone lines and other basic needs keep flowing across state lines to cities and suburbs.   mr trump has said he could compel companies to prioritise making ventilators, masks and other needed goods. some have volunteered; the hanes underwear company, for example, will use its cotton to make masks for hospital workers.   he also has the military:\u00a0the navy is committing two hospital ships to the fight. and he can call up the national guard. as of last saturday evening, more than 6,500 national guard members already are assisting in the coronavirus response in 38 states, puerto rico and the district of columbia.   high-level decisions like these must be made quickly, experts said.   \"many western political leaders are behaving as though they are on a tightrope,\" said dr\u00a0david nabarro, a who special envoy on covid-19 and a veteran of fights against sars, \nebola and cholera.   \"but there is no choice. we must do all in our power to fight this,\" he added. \"i sense that most people - and certainly those in business - get it. they would prefer to take the bitter medicine at once and contain outbreaks as they start rather than gamble with uncertainty.\"   the roughly 175,000 ventilators in all us hospitals and the national stockpile are expected to be far fewer than are needed to handle a surge of patients desperate for breath.   the machines pump air and oxygen into the lungs, but they normally cost us$25,000 or more each, and neither individual hospitals nor the federal emergency stockpile has ever had enough on hand to handle the number of pneumonia patients that this pandemic is expected to produce.   new york, for example, has found about 6,000 ventilators for purchase around the world, new york governor andrew\u00a0cuomo said. he estimated the state would need about 30,000.   the manufacturers, including a dozen in the us, say there is no easy way to ramp up production quickly. but it is possible other manufacturers, including aerospace and automobile companies, could be enlisted to do so.   ventilators are basically air pumps with motors controlled by circuits that make them act like lungs: the pump pushes air into the patient, then stops so the weight of the chest can push the air back out.   automobiles and airplanes contain many small pumps, like those for oil, water and air-conditioning fluid, that might be modified to act as basic, stripped-down ventilators. on sunday, mr trump tweeted that ford and general motors had been \"given the go-ahead\" to produce ventilators.   providers, meanwhile, are scrambling for alternatives.   canadian nurses are disseminating a 2006 paper describing how one ventilator can be modified to treat four patients simultaneously. inventors have proposed combining cpap machines, which many sleep apnea sufferers own, and oxygen tanks to improvise a ventilator.   the us must also work to increase its supply of piped and tanked oxygen, dr aylward said.   one of the lessons of china, he noted, was that many covid-19 patients who would normally have been intubated and on ventilators managed to survive with oxygen alone.   hospitals in the us have taken some measures to handle surges of patients, such as stopping elective surgery and setting up isolation rooms.   to protect bedridden long-term patients, nursing homes and hospitals also should immediately stop admitting visitors and do constant health checks on their staff, said dr\u00a0james leduc, director of the galveston national laboratory at the university of texas medical branch.   the national stockpile does contain some prepackaged military field hospitals, but they are not expected to be nearly enough for a big surge.   in wuhan, the chinese government famously built two new hospitals in two weeks. all other hospitals were divided: 48 were designated to handle 10,000 serious or critical coronavirus patients, while others \nwere restricted to handling emergencies like heart attacks and births.   wherever that was impractical, hospitals were divided into \"clean\" and \"dirty\" zones, and the medical teams did not cross over. walls to isolate whole wards were built, and - as in ebola wards - doctors went in one end of the room wearing protective gear and left by the other end, where they de-gowned under the eyes of a nurse to prevent infection.   as of last saturday, schools in 45 states were closed entirely, but that is a decision that divided experts.   \"closing all schools may not make sense unless there is documented widespread community transmission, which we're not seeing in most of the country,\" said dr\u00a0thomas r. frieden, a former cdc director under president barack obama.   it is unclear how much children spread coronavirus. they very seldom get sick enough to be hospitalised, which is not true of flu. current testing cannot tell whether most might even become infected.   in china, dr aylward said, he asked all of the doctors he spoke to whether they had seen any family clusters in which a child was the first to be infected. no one had, he said, which astonished him.   that leaves a quandary. closing schools is a normal part of social distancing; after all, schools are the workplaces for many adults, too. and when the disease is clearly spreading within an individual school, it must close.   but closing whole school districts can seriously disrupt a city's ability to fight an outbreak. with their children stuck at home, nurses, doctors, police officers and other emergency medical workers cannot come to work.   also, many children in low-income families depend on the meals they eat at schools.   cities that close all schools are creating special \"hub schools\" for the children of essential workers. in ohio, the governor has told school bus drivers to deliver hot meals to children who normally get them at school.   china's effort succeeded, experts said, in part because of hundreds of thousands of volunteers. the government declared a \"people's war\" and rolled out a \"fight on, wuhan! fight on, china!\" campaign.   it made inspirational films that combined airline ads with 1940s-style wartime propaganda. the ads were somewhat corny, but they rallied the public.   many people idled by the lockdowns stepped up to act as fever checkers, contact tracers, hospital construction workers, food deliverers, even babysitters for the children of first responders, or as crematory workers.   with training, volunteers were able to do some ground-level but crucial medical tasks, such as basic nursing, lab technician work or making sure that hospital rooms were correctly decontaminated.   americans often step forward to help neighbors affected by hurricanes and floods; many will no doubt do so in this outbreak, but they will need training in how not to fall ill and add to the problem.   \"in my experience, success is dependent on how much the public is informed and participates,\" adm \nziemer said. \"this truly is an 'all hands on deck' situation.\"   clinicians in china, italy and france have thrown virtually everything they have in hospital pharmacies into the fight, and at least two possibilities have emerged that might save patients: the anti-malaria drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, and the antiviral remdesivir, which has no licensed use.   there is not proof yet that any of these are effective against the virus. china registered more than 200 clinical trials, including several involving those treatments, but investigators ran out of patients in critical condition to enroll. italy and france have trials under way, and hospitals in new york are writing trial protocols now.   one worry for trial leaders is that chloroquine has been given so much publicity that patients may refuse to be \"randomised\" and accept a 50 per cent chance of being given a placebo.   if any drug works on critical cases, it might be possible to use small doses as a prophylactic to prevent infection.   an alternative is to harvest protective antibodies from the blood of people who have survived the illness, said dr\u00a0peter j. hotez, dean of the national school of tropical medicine at baylor college of medicine in houston.   the purified blood serum - called immunoglobulin - could possibly be used in small amounts to protect emergency medical workers, too.   \"unfortunately, the first wave won't benefit from this,\" dr hotez said. \"we need to wait until we have enough survivors.\"   the ultimate hope is to have a vaccine that will protect everyone, and many companies and governments have already rushed the design of candidate vaccines. but as dr fauci has explained multiple times, testing those candidate vaccines for safety and effectiveness takes time.   the process will take at least a year, even if nothing goes wrong. the roadblock, vaccine experts explained, is not bureaucratic. it is that the human immune system takes weeks to produce antibodies, and some dangerous side effects can take weeks to appear.   after extensive animal testing, vaccines are normally given to about 50 healthy human volunteers to see if they cause any unexpected side effects and to measure what dose produces enough antibodies to be considered protective.   if that goes well, the trial enrolls hundreds or thousands of volunteers in an area where the virus is circulating. half get the vaccine, the rest do not - and the investigators wait. if the vaccinated half do not get the disease, the green light for production is finally given.

China moves the annual meeting of the National People's Congress because of the Coronavirus epidemic. This reported the state channel CCTV. A new appointment will set the Standing Committee of the Politburo of the Governing Communist Party at a later date. The ten-day meetings had to take place on March 5th. Around 6,000 delegates from all over the country should have participated. Last week, the Permanent Committee of the People's Congress had been pronounced for a displacement of the appointment. The People's Congress is moved according to CCTV information for the first time since the cultural revolution. He has always been together in March for 35 years. The shift was also based on the fact that many of the deputies \"at the forefront\" fought against the epidemic. China recently recorded a strong increase in coronavirus infected numbers. More than 77,000 people have infected with pulmonary disease. 2,592 people had died of the consequences of the virus. It is believed that the pathogens on a market in the Central Chinese million town of Wuhan has passed from a wildlife to humans. The Permanent Committee of the Politburo therefore advised at its meeting on this Monday also to ban the trade in wildlife, as reported to the official news agency Xinhua. For a month Wuhan has been sealed off the outside world. Numerous foreign citizens have been returned from there to their home countries. For the first time, experts of the World Health Organization (WHO) are now in Wuhan. You visit two hospitals there and meet the chief of the Chinese Health Commission, MA Xiaowei, as well as other people's disease protection of the Province of Hubei. At the end of 2019, China's World Health Organization WHO reported a pulmonary inflammation of unclear cause from Wuhan. A week later, researchers identified a novel virus as the cause: they called it 2019-NCOV. It belongs to the group of coronaviruses. Meanwhile, it is known as SARS COV-2 (COV stands for coronavirus, SARS for a respiratory disease triggered by a similar pathogen). SARS-COV-2 could have spread from a food market in Wuhan. There, exotic animals like reptiles were also sold. The lung disease that can trigger the new virus is now referred to as COVID-19 (English for coronavirus disease; Coronavirus disease). The disease is a so-called zoonose - a plague through a pathogen from the animal kingdom. Parts of virus bodies of SARS COV-2 same pathogens affecting bats. The new virus could have been transferred to humans via a still unknown intermediary. Both the respiratory diseases SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Mers (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) are from \nCoronaviruses caused to have its origins in animals. During the SARS pandemic, about 8,000 people infected in the years 2002 and 2003, more than 750 died. With the Mers virus, about 2,500 people have begun since his discovery of 2012 until the end of 2019, each third has died. In total there are several hundred types of coronaviren. Many of them affect the respiratory tract and can cause colds. Medizors and physicians assume that the virus is transmitted above all about droplet infection from person to person. The WHO recommends to pay attention to general hygiene rules: you should often wash your hands and close close contact with persons with respiratory diseases and wild animals.

In most, the infection is very mild. Among the deaths are mainly people with severe pre-existence and older people. The course of the registered cases in Germany can be tracked here on this map. The number of infected worldwide, which have been positively tested on Corona, shows this map of Johns-Hopkins University. That can not be said yet. The WHO announced on January 28, that about one-fifth of the persons filed as an infected persons through the virus will be severely ill, so in case of doubt should be treated intensive care. Meanwhile, the WHO classifies the disease as a pandemic. Diverse states have imposed entry and outgoing restrictions to slow the spread. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and breathing difficulties. States around the world have now reported infection cases, including Germany. Researchers are currently working on therapies and vaccination. The first clinical trials with vaccines have begun, that is, a few patients are tested by testing. In Italy, most of the country affected by the virus in Europe, the fifth Covid-19 death has been reported. Over 200 infected were registered so far. The Italian authorities had taken draconian measures to curb the virus at the weekend. Eleven communities in the north of the country were sealed out, 52,000 people are practically under quarantine.
